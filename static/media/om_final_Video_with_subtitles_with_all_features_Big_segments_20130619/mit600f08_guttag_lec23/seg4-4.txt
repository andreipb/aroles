way thats the way i ended up setting a lot of these 

parameters and playing with it was comparing what my 

simulation said to historical stock data 

and indeed it is the case that the price of the stock the 

move the amount of move tends to be proportional 

to the price of the stock 

expensive stocks move more 

interestingly enough the percentage moves are not much 

different between cheap stocks and expensive stocks 

and thats why i ended up using a multiplicative factor 

rather than an additive factor 

this is again a general lesson 

as you build these kinds of simulations or anything like 

this you need to think through whether things should be 

multiplicative or additive 

because you get very different results typically 

multiplicative is what you want to do if the amount of change 

is proportional to the current size whether its price or 

anything else and additive if the change is independent of 


the current value typically is i think the general 

way to think about it 

now youll see this other kind of peculiar thing 

so ive now set the price and then ive got this test here 

if mo mo stands for momentum 

im now exploring the question of whether or not stock prices 

are indeed memoryless or the stock changes 

and the fancy word for that is poisson 

people often model things as poisson processes which is to 

say processes in which past behavior has no impact on 

future behavior its memoryless 

and in fact thats what the efficient market hypothesis 

purports to say 

it says that since all the information is in the current 

price you dont have to worry about whether it went up or 


down yesterday to decide what its going to do today 

there are people who dont believe that and instead 

argue that there is this notion called momentum 

these are called momentum investors 

and they say whats most likely to happen today is 

what happened yesterday 

or more likely 

if the stock went up yesterday its more likely to go up 

today than if it didnt go up yesterday 

so i wasnt sure which religion i was willing to believe in if 

either so i added a parameter called if you believe in 

momentum then you should change the price by  and here 

i just did something taking a gaussian times the last change 

and in fact added it in 

so if it went up yesterday it will more likely go up today 

because im throwing in a positive number otherwise 

a negative number 

notice that this is additive 

because its dealing with yesterdays price 

change with the change 

ok so thats why were dealing with that 

now heres where i shouldve put in this 

test that i had up here 

get it out from there 

because what i want to do is say if self dot price is less 

than  im going to set it to  just keep it there 


that doesnt solve the problem we had before though right 

then im going to append it and keep the last 

change for future use 

ok people understand whats going on here 

and then show history is just going to produce a plot 

weve seen that a million times before 

any questions about this 

well i have a question 


does it make any sense 

is it going to work at all 

so now lets test it 

so i now have this unit test program called unit test stock 

i originally did not make it a function i had it inline and 

i realized that was really stupid because i wanted 

to do it a lot of times 

so its got an internal procedure internal function 

local to the unit test that runs the simulation 

and it takes the set of stocks to simulate a fig figure 

number this is going to print a bunch of graphs and i want 

to say what graph it is and whether or not i 

believe in big mo 

it sets the mean to  and then for s in the stocks it moves 

it giving it the bias and the momentum then it 

shows the history 

and then computes the mean of getting me the mean 

of all the stocks in it 

weve seen this sort of thing many times before 

ive then got some constants 

by the way i want to emphasize that ive named these constants 

to make it easier to change 

starting with  stocks  days 

and then what i do is i stock sub  stocks  will be the 

empty list stocks  is the empty list 

why do you think im starting with bias of  

because what do you think the mean should be if i simulate 


various things that the bias of  

i start  as the average price of the stock 

what should the average price of the stock be 

if my code is correct what should the average price be 

after say  days if theres no bias 

pardon 

 exactly 

since theres no upward or downward bias 

they may fluctuate wildly but if i look at enough stocks the 


average should be right around  

i dont know what the average would be if i 

chose a different bias 

its a little bit complicated so i chose the simplest bias 

important lesson so that there would be some predictability in 

the results and i would have some if you will smoke test 

for knowing whether or not i was getting my code 

seemed to be working 

all right and initially well maybe initially just to be 

simple im going to start momentum equal to false 


because again it seems simpler have a model where 

theres no momentum 

im looking for the simplest model possible for the 

first time i run it 

and then we looked at this little loop before for i in 

range number of stocks im going to create two different 

lists of stocks one where the moves or distributions are 

chosen from a uniform and the other where theyre gaussian 

because im sort of curious as to again which is the right 

way to think about this all right 


and then im going to just call it 

well see what we get 

so lets do it 

lets hope that all the changes i mad have not introduced 

a syntax error 

all right well at least it did something 

lets see what it did 

so the test on the left youll remember was the one with test 

one i believe was the uniform distribution and test 

two is the gaussian 

so but lets what should we do first 

well lets do the smoke test number is the mean more 

or less what we expected 

well it looks like its dead on  which was our 

initial price in test two 

and in test one its a little bit above  

but we didnt do that many stocks or that many days 

so its quite plausible that its correct 

but just to be sure not to be sure but just to increase my 

confidence im going to just run it again 

well here im a little bit below  and in two and 

test one a little bit below  as well 

you remember last time was a little bit above  

i feel pretty good about this and in fact i ran it a lot 

of times in my office 

and it just bounces around hovering around  

course this is the wrong way to do it 

i should really just put it in a nice test harness where i 

run    trials but i didnt want to bore 

you with that here 

so well see that ok we passed the first smoke test 

we seem to be where we expect to be 

well lets try smoke test two 

what else might we want to see to see if we got 

things working properly 


well i kind of ignored the notion of bias by making it 

 so lets give it a big bias here 

assuming it will let me edit it 

we just gotta start it up again its the 

safest thing to do 

you wouldnt think i would have i dont have  all 

right be that way about it 

fortunately weve been through this before
