yeah 

will the final be open note 

final will be open book open notes 

just like the quizzes 

it will be the first two hours of the allotted time we wont 

go the whole  hours ok 

so it wont be hugely longer than the quizzes 

it would be a little bit longer 

and again very much in the same style of the quizzes 


all right lets look at this 

lets assume that youve won the lottery and have serious 

money that you foolishly wish to invest in the stock market 

there are two basic strategies to choose from in investing 

you can either have whats called an indexed portfolio 

or a managed portfolio 

indexed portfolios you basically say i want to own 

all of the stocks that there are and if the stock market 

goes up i make money if the stock market goes 

down i lose money 

im not going to be thinking im clever and can pick 

winners and losers im just betting on the 

market as a whole 

theyre attractive in that a they dont require 

a lot of thought 

and b they have whats called a low expense ratio since 

theyre easy to implement you dont pay anyone to be 

brilliant to implement if for you 

so theyre very low fees 

a managed portfolio you find somebody you think is really 

smart and you pay them a fair amount of money and in return 

they assert that they will pick winners for you and in fact 


you will outperform the stock market 

and if it goes up  percent well youll go up  percent 

or more and if it goes down dont worry im so smart 

your stocks wont go down 

theres a lot of debate about which is the 

better of these two 

and so now were going to try and see if we can write a 

simulation that will give us some insight as to which of 


these might be better or worse 

all right so thats the basic problem 

now as we know and by the way were not going to write a 

perfect simulation here because were going to try and 

do it in  minutes or  minutes 

and it would take at least an hour do a perfect simulation 

of the stock market 

all right 

first thing we need to do is have some sort of a theory 

when we did the spring we had this theory of hookes law that 

told us something and we built a simulation or built some 

tools around that theory 

now we need to think about a model of the stock market 

and the model were going to use is based on whats 

called the efficient market hypothesis 

so the moral here again is whenever youre doing an 

implementation of a simulation you do need to have some 

underlying theory about the model 

what this model asserts is that markets are 

informationally efficient 

that is to say current prices reflect all publicly known 

information about each stock and therefore are unbiased 


that if people thought that the stock was underpriced well 

people would buy more of it in the price would have 

risen already 

if people thought the stock was overpriced well people would 

have tried to sell it and it would have come down 

so this is a very popular theory believed by 

many famous economists today and in the past 

and says ok that effectively means that the market 

is memoryless 

ok that it doesnt matter what the price of the 

stock was yesterday 

today its priced given the bestknown information and 


so tomorrow its equally likely to go up or down 

relative to the whole market right 

its well known that over periods of multiple 

decades the market has a tendency to go up 

and so theres an upward bias to the stock market contrary 

to what you may have seen recently 

but that no particular stock is more or less likely to 

outperform the market because all the information is 

incorporated in the price 

and that leads to a notion of being able to model 

the market how 

how would you model individual stocks if you believe 

this hypothesis 

somebody 

whats going to happen 


random walk 

yes exactly right 

so we would model it as a random walk 

in fact theres a very famous book called a random walk down 

wall street that was one of the first to make 

this hypothesis 

now later we may decide to abandon this model but for 

the moment lets accept that 

and lets think about how were going to build the simulation 

whenever i think about how to build an interesting program 

and i hope whenever you think about it the first thing i 

think about is what are the classes i might want to 

have what are the types 

and it seems pretty obvious that at least two of the 

things im going to want are stock and market 

after all im going to try and build a simulation of the stock 

market so i might as well have the notion of a market and 

probably the notion of a stock 

which should i implement first 

well my usual style of programming would be to 

implement the one thats lowest down in the 

hierarchy near the bottom 

i wont be able to show you what a market does unless i 


have stocks but i can look at what an individual stock does 

without having a market 

so why do i implement this first 

because it will be easier to unit test 

i can build class stock and i can test class stock before 

i have a class market 

so now lets look at it 

clean up the desktop a little bit 

this is similar to but not identical to what you 

have in your handout 

all right so theres class stock 

and im going to initialize it create them with 

an opening price 

when a stock is first listed in the market it 

comes with some price 

im gonna keep as part of each stock its history of prices 

which we can initialize well ive initialized it as empty 

but thats probably the wrong thing right 

i probably should have had it being the starting here 

right the opening price 

now comes an interesting part 


self dot distribution 

well i lied to you a little bit in my description of 

what it meant to have the efficient market hypothesis 

i said that no stock is likely to outperform the market or 

underperform the market 

but its not quite true because typically what they 

actually do that is they say its adjusted for risk 

its clear that some stocks are more volatile than others 

if you will buy stock in an electrical utility which has a 

guaranteed revenue stream because no matter how bad the 


economy gets a lot of people still use electricity you 

dont expect it to fluctuate a lot 

if you buy stock in a high tech company that sells things on 

the internet you might expect it to fluctuate enormously 

or if you buy stock in a retailer you might expect 

it to go up or down more dramatically with the economy 

and so in fact there is a notion of risk and im not 

going to do this in this simulation but usually people 

have to be paid to take risk 

and so its usually the case that you can get a higher 

return if youre willing to take more risk 

we might or might not have time to come back to that 

but more generally the point is that each stock actually 

behaves a little bit differently 

theres a distribution of how it would move 

so even if on average the stock is expected to not move 

at all from where it starts some stocks will be expected to 

just trundle along without much change not very volatile 

and other stocks might jump up and down a lot because
