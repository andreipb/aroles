i want to pick up exactly where 

i left off last time 

when i was talking about various sins one can 

commit with statistics 

and i had been talking about the sin of data enhancement 

where the basic idea there is you take a piece of data and 


you read much more into it than it implies 

in particular a very common thing people do with data 

is they extrapolate 

id given you a couple of examples 

in the real world its often not desirable to say that i 

have a point here and a point here therefore the next 

point will surely be here 

and we can just extrapolate in a straight line 

we before saw some examples where i had an algorithm to 

generate points and we fit a curve to it used the curve to 

predict future points and discovered it was 

nowhere close 

unfortunately we often see people do this sort of thing 


one of my favorite stories is william ruckelshaus who was 

head of the environmental protection agency in 

the early s 

and he had a press conference spoke about the increased use 

of cars and the decreased amount of carpooling 

he was trying to get people to carpool since at the time 

carpooling was on the way down and i now quote each car 

entering the central city sorry in  he said each 

car entering the central city had  people in it 

by  this had dropped to less than  

if present trends continue by  more than  out of every 

 cars entering the city will have no driver amazingly 

enough the press reported this as a straight story and talked 


about how we would be dramatically dropping 

of course as it happened it didnt occur 

but its just an example of how much trouble you can 

get into by extrapolating 

the final sin i want to talk about is probably the most 

common and its called the texas sharpshooter fallacy 

now before i get into that are any of you here from texas 

all right youre going to be offended 

let me think ok anybody here from oklahoma 

youll like it 

ill dump on oklahoma it will be much better then 

well talk about the oklahoma sharpshooter fallacy 

we wont talk about the bcs rankings though 


so the idea here is a pretty simple one 

this is a famous marksman who fires his gun randomly at the 

side of a barn has a bunch of holes in it then goes and 

takes a can of paint and draws bullseyes around all the places 

his bullets happened to hit 

and people walk by the barn and say god he is good 

so obviously not a good thing but amazingly easy 

to fall into this trap 

so heres another example 

in august of  a paper which people took seriously 

appeared in a moderately serious journal called 

the new scientist 

and it announced that researchers in scotland had 

proven that anorexics are likely to have been 

born in june 

im sure you all knew that 

how did how did they prove this 

or demonstrate this 

they studied  women 

each of whom had been diagnosed anorexic 

and they observed that about  percent more than 

average were born in june 

now since the monthly average of births if you divide this 

by  its about  that tells us that  

were born in june 

so at first sight this seems significant and in fact if you 

run tests and ask whats the likelihood of that many more 

being born in  month youll find that its quite unlikely 

in fact youll find the probability of this happening 

is only about  percent of it happening just by accident 

whats wrong with the logic here 

yes 

they only studied diagnosed anorexics 

no because they were only interested in the 

question of when are anorexics born so it made sense 

to only study those 

now maybe youre right that we could study that in fact more 

people are born in june period 

that could be true 

this would be one of the fallacies we looked 

at before right 

that theres a lurking variable which is just that people are 

more likely to be born in june 

so thats certainly a possibility 

what else 

what else is the flaw 

wheres the flaw in this logic 


well what did they do 

they participated in the oklahoma sharpshooter fallacy 

what they did is they looked at  months they took the 

months with the most births in it which happened to be 

june and calculated the probability of  percent 

they didnt start with the hypothesis that it was june 

they started with  months and then they drew a 

bullseye around june 

so the right question to ask is whats the probability not 

that june had  babies but that at least one of the 

 months had  babies 

that probability is a lot to higher than  percent right 

in fact its about  percent 

so what we see is again perfectly reasonable 

statistical techniques but not looking at 

things in the right way 


and answering the wrong question 

that make sense to everybody 

and you can see why people can fall into this trap right 

it was a perfectly sensible seemingly sensible argument 

so the moral of this particular thing is be very careful about 

looking at your data drawing a conclusion and then saying how 

probable was that to have occurred 

because again youre probably or maybe drawing the 

bullseye around something thats already there 


now if they had taken another set of  anorexics and again 

june was the month then there would be some 

credibility in it 

because they would have started with the hypothesis not that 

there existed a month but that june was particularly likely 

but then they would have to also check and make sure that 

june isnt just a popular month to be born as 

was suggested earlier 

all right i could go on and on with this sort of 

thing its kind of fun 


but i wont 

instead im going to torture you with yet 

one more simulation 

you may be tempted at this point to just zone out 

try not to 

and as an added incentive for you to pay attention im 

going to warn you that this particular simulation will 

appear in the final or a variant of it 

and what well be doing is early next week well be 

distributing code which well ask you to study about two or 

three pages of code and then on the final well be asking 

you questions about the code 

not that you have to memorize it well 

give you a copy of it 

but you should understand it before you walk in 

to take the final 

because there will not be time to look at that code for the 

first time during the quiz and figure out what its doing 

ok so lets look at it 

i should also warn you that this code includes some python 

concepts at least one that you have not yet seen 

well see it briefly today 

this is on purpose because one of the things i hope you have 

learned to do this semester is look up things you dont know 

and figure out what they do 

what they mean 


because we obviously cant in any course or even any set of 

courses tell you everything youll ever want 

to know in life 

so intentionally weve seeded some things in this program 

that will be unfamiliar so during the time youre studying 

the program get online look it up figure out what they do 

if you have trouble we will be having office hours where 

you can go and get some help 

but the tas will expect you to have at least tried to 

figure it out yourself
