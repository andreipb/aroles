Description
his subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience. 
It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation 
can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of 
their major, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small 
programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the 
Python™ programming language.
