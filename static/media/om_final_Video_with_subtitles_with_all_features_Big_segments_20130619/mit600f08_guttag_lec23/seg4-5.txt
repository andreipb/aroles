we know if we relaunch the finder 

who says mac os is flawless 

all right we were down here and i was saying lets try 

a larger introduce a bias 

again were trying to see if it does what 

we think it might do 

so what do you think it should do with a bias 

where should the mean be now 

still around  

or higher right 

because weve now put in a bias suggesting 

that it should go up 

oops 

it wouldnt have hurt it 

all right 

so lets run it 

sure enough for one we see test two its a little bit 

over  and for test one its way over  

well lets make sure its not a fluke 

try it again 

so sure enough changing the bias changed the price 

and even changed it in the right direction 

so we can feel pretty comfortable that its doing 

something good with that 

we could also feel pretty comfortable that thats 

probably way too high a bias right 

we would not expect that the mean should be over  or 

in one case  after only  days trading right 

things dont typically go up  in  days 

they go down  but  all right so thats good 

oh lets look at something else now 

lets go back to where a simpler bias here 

well run it again 

and think about whats the difference between the 

gaussian and the normal 

can we deduce anything about those 

not well let me ask you 

what do you think yes or no 

anybody see anything interesting here 

yeah 

the variance of the gaussian seems to be less than 

the variance of the uniform 

the variance of the gaussian  

 is less 


so all right that appears to be the case here 

but lets run it again as weve done with 

all the other tests 

so we have a hypothesis 

lets not fall victim to the oklahoma sharpshooter 

well test our hypothesis or at least examine it again 

see if its in some sense repeatable 

well now what do we see 

doesnt seem to be true this time right 

not obviously 

so were not sure about this 


so this is something that we would need to 

investigate further 

and we would need to have to look at it and its going to 

be very tricky by the way as to what the right answer is 

but if you think about it it would not be surprising if the 

gaussians at least gave us some surprising more extreme 

results than the uniform 

because the uniform as weve set it up here is bounded 


the minimum and the maximum is bounded 

with the gaussian theres a tail 

and you might every once in a while get this at least as 

weve done it in this case this large move out at the end 

you might not 

theres nothing profound about this other than the 

understanding that the details of how you set these things 

up can matter a lot 

well the final thing i want to look at is momentum 

so lets go back and lets set mo to true here 

well doesnt want us to set mo to true here 

ah there it does 

so and now lets run it and see what happens 

what do you think should happen 

anybody 

inaudible 

i think youre right 

these ones should curl see if i can  oh not bad 

lets run it 

well its a little hard to see but things 

tend to take off 

because once things started moving it tends to 

move in that direction 

all right 

how do we go about choosing these parameters 

how do we go about deciding what to do 


well we play with it the way ive been playing with it and 

compare the results to some set of real data 

and then we try and get our simulation to match the past 

and hope that that will help it predict the future 

were not enough time to go through all the 

to do that a lot 

i will be posting code that you can play with and i suggest 

you go through exactly this kind of exercise 

because this is really the way that people do 

develop simulations 

they dont out of whole cloth get it right the first time 

they build them they do what if games they play with them 

and then they try and adjust them to get them right 

the nice thing here is you can decide whether you believe
