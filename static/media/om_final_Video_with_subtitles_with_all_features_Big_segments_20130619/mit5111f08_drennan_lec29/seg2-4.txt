which doesnt have anything in the z direction ah and then in 

terms also other orbitals that have a component along z 

are going to be affected a little bit by that but our 

other one here is not going to be true so we just have all of 

the above is not correct so we have this one 

so if we had up those thats actually a pretty good score 

and so you could think about say what would be true of a 

complex that was linear along z what would be the most 

stabilized for example 

so these are the kinds of questions you can get and 

i think there are a few on the problemset 

all right so lets come back together now and talk 

about magnetism again 

so we said in the beginning that magnetism can be used to 


figure out geometry in say a metal cluster in an enzyme and 

lets give an example of how that could be true 

so suppose you have a nickel plus  system so that would be 

a d  system so we have group  minus  or d  and it was 

found to be diamagnetic 

and from that we may be able to guess using these kinds of 

diagrams whether it has square planar geometry 

tetrahedral geometry or octahedral geometry 

we can predict the geometry based on that information 

lets think about how thats true 

we have a d  system 

think about octahedral for a minute 

are there two options for how this might look in this case 

is there going to be a difference in electron 

configurations if its a weak field or a strong field 

so write it out on your handout and tell me whether 


it would be true think about it both ways 

is there a difference 

so you would end up getting the same thing 

in this particular case 

so if its a weak field and you put in    then jump 

up here   and then you have to come back    

or you could pair up all the ones on the bottom first and 

then go up there but you actually get the same result no 


matter which way you put them in the diagram looks the same 

so it doesnt matter in this case if it is a weak or strong 

field you end up with those number of electrons with the 

exact same configuration 

so we know what that looks like 

well what about square planar 

so lets put our electrons in there 

well start at the bottom well just put them in 

im not going to worry too much about whether we can jump up or 

not well just go and pair them up as we go down here and 

then go up here and now weve put in our eight electrons 

so how close these are were just going to put them all in 

were just going to be very careful not to bump up any 

electrons there unless we absolutely have to because d x 

squared minus y squared is very much more destabilized in the 

square planar system so were going to want to pair all 

our electrons up in those lower energy orbitals 

so even if we sort of did it a different way 

thats what we would get 

so were going to want to pair everything up before we go 

up to that top one there 

so theres our square planar 

well what about tetrahedral 

how are we going to fill these up 

do we want to pair first or we do want to put them to the 

full extent possible singly 

single right its going to be a weak field theres not a big 

splitting here between these so well put them in theres 

        

all right so now we can consider which of these will 

be paramagnetic and which will be diamagnetic 

whats octahedral 

its paramagnetic we have unpaired electrons 

what about square planar 

square planars diamagnetic 

and what about tetrahedral 

paramagnetic 

so if the experimental data told us that a nickel center in 

an enzyme was diamagnetic and we were trying to decide 

between those three geometries it really seems like square 

planar is going to be our best guess 


and so let me show you an example of a 

square planar system 

and so this particular nickel is in a square planar system 

it has four ligands that are all in the same plane and it 

is a square planar center for a nickel so thats one example 

and this is a cluster thats involved in life 

on carbon dioxide 

all right so thats different geometries 

youre set with that 

monday were going to talk about colors of coordination 

complexes which all have to do with the different geometries
