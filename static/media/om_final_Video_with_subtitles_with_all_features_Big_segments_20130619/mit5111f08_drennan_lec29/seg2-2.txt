pointing directly toward those d orbitals 

the orbitals are offaxis ligands are onaxis 

so there will be much smaller repulsions there 

and that we talked about the fact that for d x squared minus 

y squared and d z squared theyre both have experienced 

large repulsions theyre both degenerate in energy they go 

up in energy whereas these three d orbitals smaller 

repulsion and theyre also degenerate with respect to each 

other and theyre stabilized compared to these guys up here 


so you can try to hold those up and convince yourself that 

thats true for the octahedral case 

so thats what we talked about last time and now we want to 

 oh and ill just remind you we looked at these splitting 

diagrams as well 

we looked at the average energy of the d orbitals  d z 

squared and d x squared minus y squared go up in energy 

and then the other three d orbitals go down in energy 

so now we want to consider what happens with 

different geometries 

so now you can turn your octahedral case into a 

square planar case and how am i going to do that 


yeah so we can just take off the top and the bottom and we 

have our nice square planar case and try to make a 

tetrahedral complex as well 

and heres an example of a tetrahedral one 

again you can take a jelly bean in the middle and big 

jelly bean and then the smaller ones on the outside 

so what angles am i going for here in the tetrahedral case 

  

 

so you can go ahead and make your tetrahedral complex 

and dont worry so much about the   

 but well see if people can do a good job with the  

ok how are your tetrahedral complexes coming 

do they look like this sort of 

so let me define for you how were going to consider 

the tetrahedral case 

so in the tetrahedral case were going to have the xaxis 

comes out of the plane the yaxis is this way zaxis 


again up and down 

were going to have one ligand coming out here another going 

back and then these two are pretty much in the 

plane of the screen 

so this is sort of how im holding the tetrahedral complex 

with respect to the x z and y coordinate system 

so there is a splitting energy splitting associated 

with tetrahedral and its going to be smaller than 


octahedral because none of these ligands will be pointing 

directly toward the orbitals 

but lets consider which orbitals are going to be most 

affected by a tetrahedral case 

so lets consider d z squared 

what do you think 

is that going to be particularly  are the ligands 

pointing toward d z squared 

no 

and d x squared minus y squared we can think of 

what about that one 

no not really 

what about d x y d y z and d x y 

moreso 

so if you try holding up your tetrahedral in our coordinate 

system and then hold your d orbitals  degrees offaxis 

its not perfect theyre not pointing directly toward them 

but its a little closer than for the d orbitals that 

are directly onaxis 

so if we look at this we see that the orbitals are going to 

be split in the exact opposite way of the octahedral system 

in the octahedral system the ligands are onaxis so the 

orbitals that are onaxis d x squared minus y squared and d 

z squared are going to be the most affected 

but with tetrahedral the ligands are offaxis so the 

d orbitals that are also offaxis are going to 

be the most affected 

but theyre not going to be as dramatically affected so the 

splitting is actually smaller in this case 

so here with tetrahedral you have the opposite of 

the octahedral system 

and you can keep these and try to convince yourself 

of that later if you have trouble visualizing it 

so youll have more repulsion between the ligands as negative 


point charges and the d orbitals that are  degrees 

offaxis than you do with the two d orbitals 

that are onaxis 

so here d x squared minus y squared and d z squared have 

the same energy with respect to each other theyre degenerate 

and we have our d y z x z and x y have the same energy 

with respect to each other they are also degenerate 

so its the same sets that are degenerate as with 

octahedral but theyre all affected differently 


so now lets look at the energy diagrams and compare the 

octahedral system with the tetrahedral system 

remember an octahedral we had the two orbitals going 

up and three going down 

the splitting the energy difference between 

them was abbreviated 

the octahedral crystal field splitting energy with a 

little o for octahedral 

we now have a t for tetrahedral so we have 

a different name 

and so here is now our tetrahedral set 


you notice its the opposite of octahedral so the orbitals 

that were most destabilized in the octahedral case are now 

more stabilized down here so weve moved down in energy 

and the orbitals that are offaxis  degrees offaxis 

which were stabilized in the octahedral system because none 

of ligands were pointing right toward them now those ligands 

are a bit closer so they jump up in energy and so we have 

this swap between the two 

so we have some new labels as well 

so we had e g up here as an abbreviation for these sets 

of orbitals and now thats just referred to as e 


notice the book in one place has an e  but uses e in all 

the other places so just use e the e  was a 

mistake in the book 

and then we have t  g becomes t  up here 

so we have this slightly different nomenclature and we 

have this flip in direction 

so the other thing that is important to emphasize is that 

the tetrahedral splitting energy is smaller because none 


of those ligands are pointing directly toward any 

of the d orbitals 

so here there is a much larger difference here there is a 

smaller difference so thats why its written much closer 

together so thats smaller 

and because of that many tetrahedral complexes are high 

spin and in this course you can assume that theyre 

all high spin 

so that means theres a weak field theres not a big 

energy difference between those orbital sets 

and again were going to  since were going to consider
