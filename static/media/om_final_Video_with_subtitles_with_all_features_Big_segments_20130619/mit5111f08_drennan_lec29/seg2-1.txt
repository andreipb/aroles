ok lets just 

  the clicker question 

ok  i think that says  which is not bad but 

we should be at  

so when youre past the equivalence point so youve 

converted all of your weak in this case acid to its 

conjugate base and because it was a weak acid the conjugate 

base is going to be a weak based and so its not 

contributing a whole lot itll make the solution basic but 

its nothing compared to adding strong base in there 

so even though you have the weak base around at 

this point its really a strong base problem 


so you would calculate this by looking at how many mils of the 

strong base youve added past and figure out the number of 

moles that there are and divide by the total volume 

so this was like one of the problems on the exam and one 

thing that i thought was interesting on the exam is that 

more people seemed to get the hard problem right than this 

which was the easy problem 

so well see on the final there will be an acid based 

titration problem on the final at least one 

so lets see if we can get then the easy and 

the hard ones right 

so youve mastered the hard ones and lets see if you can 


learn how to do the easy ones as well for the final exam 

ok so were going to continue with transition metals 

we were talking about crystal field theory and magnetism and 

you should have a handout for today and you should also have 

some equipment to make models of orbitals and coordination 

complexes  these are not snacks 

they can be snacks later right now theyre a model kit 

all right so im going to introduce you to some terms 

that were going to come back you at the end of todays 

lecture and then were going to talk about the shapes of 

coordination complexes 

so magnetism 

so we talked last time before the exam if you remember 

about high spin and low spin unpaired electrons and 

paired electrons 

well compounds that have unpaired electrons are 

paramagnetic theyre attracted by a magnetic field and those 

where the electrons are paired are diamagnetic are repelled 

by a magnetic field 

so you can tell whether a coordination complex is 

paramagnetic or diamagnetic you can test the magnetism 

and thatll give you some information about the electron 

configuration of the d orbitals in that coordination complex 

and that can tell you about the geometry 

and so youll see that by the end were going to talk about 


different types of energy orbitals when you have 

different geometries 

so why might you care about the geometry of a metal center 

well people who study proteins that have metal centers care a 

lot about the geometry of them 

so let me just give you one example 

we talked a lot about energy in the course this semester so we 

need catalysts for removing carbon monoxide and carbon 

dioxide from the environment 

and nature has some of these  they have metal cofactors and 

proteins that can do this and people have been interested in 

mimicking that chemistry to remove these gases 

from the environment 

so let me tell you these enzymes are organisms 

and this is pretty amazing some of these microorganisms 

so over here theres one  it basically lives 

on carbon monoxide 

i mean thats  you know alternative sources of energy 

are one thing but thats really quite a crazy thing 

that this guy does 

so you can grow it up in these big vats and pump in carbon 

monoxide and its like oh food and they grow and 

multiply and theyre very very happy in this carbon 

monoxide environment 

there are also microorganisms that live on carbon dioxide as 

their energy and a carbon source 


and so these organisms have enzymes in them that have metal 

centers and those metal centers are responsible for the 

ability of these organisms to live on these kind of bizarre 

greenhouse gases and pollutants 

so people would like to understand how this works 

so microbes have been estimated to remove hundred a million 

tons of carbon monoxide from the environment every year 

producing about one trillion kilograms of acetate from 

these greenhouse gases 

and so what do these catalysts look like and these enzymes 


what do these metal clusters look like that do 

this chemistry 

and this was sort of a rough model of what they look like 

and they thought it had iron and sulfur and then a nickel in 

some geometry but they had no idea sort of where the nickel 

was and how it was coordinated 

and so before there was any kind of three dimensional 

information they used spectroscopy and they 

considered whether it was paramagnetic or diamagnetic to 

get a sense of what the geometry around the metal was 


so were going to talk about different coordination 

geometries and how many unpaired or paired electrons 

you would expect depending on those geometries today 

and so crystal field theory again can help you help 

explainrationalize the properties of these transition 

metal complexes or coordination complexes 

so to help us think about geometry i always find 

for myself that its helpful to have models 


so not everyone can have such large models as these but you 

can all have your own little models of these geometries 

so what we have available to you are some mini marshmallows 

which of course as we all know are representative of d 

orbitals and jelly beans which we all know are useful 

for making coordination complexes 

so what you can do with your mini marshmallows is you can 

put together to make your different sets 

and so over here we have  oh actually it says gum drops 

 you dont have gum drops this year i changed up here i 

forgot to change it down here 

we have mini marshmallows 

dr taylor went out and tried to purchase enough gum drops to 

do this experiment and discovered that cambridge only 

had  gum drops so we have mini marshmallows 

instead today 

but this gives you the idea 

you can take one toothpick and you can make d z squared 

putting on your orbitals you have your donut in the middle 

and then your two lobes which run along the zaxis 

and then for your other sets of orbitals you can take these 

two toothpicks and put on these sets of mini marshmallows and 

handily you can just have one for all of the other d 

orbitals because depending on how you hold it it can 

represent all of the other d orbitals just very well 

so you can just have one of these for all the others 

and then your d z squared 

so what were going to do when we have our orbitals set up 


then we can think about how ligands in particular 

positions in particular geometries would clash with our 

orbitals  where thered be big repulsions or 

small repulsions 

so any other people missing their jelly beans or 

their marshmallows 

please raise your hand we have extras 

so those of you who have them go ahead and start 

making your d orbitals 

all right so if youre finished with your two d 

orbitals you can start making an octahedral complex 

so in your geometries set youll have a big gum which can 

be your center metal  youll have a big jelly bean  sorry 

big jelly beans and small jelly beans are our ligands or our 

negative point charges and you can set up and make an 

octahedral geometry here 

ok so as youre finishing this up im going to review what we 

talked about before the exam  so this isnt in todays 

lecture handouts it was in last time which we 

already went over 

but sometimes ive discovered that when theres an exam in 

the middle there needs to be a bit of a refresher its hard 

to remember what happened before the exam and you 

have your models to think about this 

so before the exam we had talked about the octahedral 

case and how compared to a spherical situation where the 

ligands are everywhere distributed around the metals 


where all d orbitals would be affectedrepulsed by the 

ligands in a symmetric fashion equally when you have them put 

as particular positions in geometry then theyre going to 

affect the different d orbitals differently 

and so if you have your d z squared made and you have your 

octahedral made you can sort of hold these up and realize 

that you would have repulsion from your ligands along the 

zaxis directly toward your orbitals from d z squared 

so that would be highly repulsive 

the ligands are along the zaxis the d orbitals are 

along the zaxis so the ligands the negative point 

charge ligands are going to be pointing right 

toward your orbitals 

and if you hold up this as a d x squared y squared orbital 

where the orbitals are right along the xaxis and right 

along the yaxis and you hold that up remember your ligands 

are right along the xaxis and right along the yaxis 

so you should also have significant repulsion for d x 

squared minus y squared and octahedrally oriented ligands 

in contrast the ligands set that are  degrees offaxis 

so d y z d x z and d x y theyre all  degrees off 

your ligands are along the axis but your orbitals 

are  degrees offaxis 

so if you look at that together youll see that 

whichever one you look at the ligands are not going to be
