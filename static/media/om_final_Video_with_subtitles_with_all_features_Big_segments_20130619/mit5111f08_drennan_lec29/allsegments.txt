ok lets just 

  the clicker question 

ok  i think that says  which is not bad but 

we should be at  

so when youre past the equivalence point so youve 

converted all of your weak in this case acid to its 

conjugate base and because it was a weak acid the conjugate 

base is going to be a weak based and so its not 

contributing a whole lot itll make the solution basic but 

its nothing compared to adding strong base in there 

so even though you have the weak base around at 

this point its really a strong base problem 


so you would calculate this by looking at how many mils of the 

strong base youve added past and figure out the number of 

moles that there are and divide by the total volume 

so this was like one of the problems on the exam and one 

thing that i thought was interesting on the exam is that 

more people seemed to get the hard problem right than this 

which was the easy problem 

so well see on the final there will be an acid based 

titration problem on the final at least one 

so lets see if we can get then the easy and 

the hard ones right 

so youve mastered the hard ones and lets see if you can 


learn how to do the easy ones as well for the final exam 

ok so were going to continue with transition metals 

we were talking about crystal field theory and magnetism and 

you should have a handout for today and you should also have 

some equipment to make models of orbitals and coordination 

complexes  these are not snacks 

they can be snacks later right now theyre a model kit 

all right so im going to introduce you to some terms 

that were going to come back you at the end of todays 

lecture and then were going to talk about the shapes of 

coordination complexes 

so magnetism 

so we talked last time before the exam if you remember 

about high spin and low spin unpaired electrons and 

paired electrons 

well compounds that have unpaired electrons are 

paramagnetic theyre attracted by a magnetic field and those 

where the electrons are paired are diamagnetic are repelled 

by a magnetic field 

so you can tell whether a coordination complex is 

paramagnetic or diamagnetic you can test the magnetism 

and thatll give you some information about the electron 

configuration of the d orbitals in that coordination complex 

and that can tell you about the geometry 

and so youll see that by the end were going to talk about 


different types of energy orbitals when you have 

different geometries 

so why might you care about the geometry of a metal center 

well people who study proteins that have metal centers care a 

lot about the geometry of them 

so let me just give you one example 

we talked a lot about energy in the course this semester so we 

need catalysts for removing carbon monoxide and carbon 

dioxide from the environment 

and nature has some of these  they have metal cofactors and 

proteins that can do this and people have been interested in 

mimicking that chemistry to remove these gases 

from the environment 

so let me tell you these enzymes are organisms 

and this is pretty amazing some of these microorganisms 

so over here theres one  it basically lives 

on carbon monoxide 

i mean thats  you know alternative sources of energy 

are one thing but thats really quite a crazy thing 

that this guy does 

so you can grow it up in these big vats and pump in carbon 

monoxide and its like oh food and they grow and 

multiply and theyre very very happy in this carbon 

monoxide environment 

there are also microorganisms that live on carbon dioxide as 

their energy and a carbon source 


and so these organisms have enzymes in them that have metal 

centers and those metal centers are responsible for the 

ability of these organisms to live on these kind of bizarre 

greenhouse gases and pollutants 

so people would like to understand how this works 

so microbes have been estimated to remove hundred a million 

tons of carbon monoxide from the environment every year 

producing about one trillion kilograms of acetate from 

these greenhouse gases 

and so what do these catalysts look like and these enzymes 


what do these metal clusters look like that do 

this chemistry 

and this was sort of a rough model of what they look like 

and they thought it had iron and sulfur and then a nickel in 

some geometry but they had no idea sort of where the nickel 

was and how it was coordinated 

and so before there was any kind of three dimensional 

information they used spectroscopy and they 

considered whether it was paramagnetic or diamagnetic to 

get a sense of what the geometry around the metal was 


so were going to talk about different coordination 

geometries and how many unpaired or paired electrons 

you would expect depending on those geometries today 

and so crystal field theory again can help you help 

explainrationalize the properties of these transition 

metal complexes or coordination complexes 

so to help us think about geometry i always find 

for myself that its helpful to have models 


so not everyone can have such large models as these but you 

can all have your own little models of these geometries 

so what we have available to you are some mini marshmallows 

which of course as we all know are representative of d 

orbitals and jelly beans which we all know are useful 

for making coordination complexes 

so what you can do with your mini marshmallows is you can 

put together to make your different sets 

and so over here we have  oh actually it says gum drops 

 you dont have gum drops this year i changed up here i 

forgot to change it down here 

we have mini marshmallows 

dr taylor went out and tried to purchase enough gum drops to 

do this experiment and discovered that cambridge only 

had  gum drops so we have mini marshmallows 

instead today 

but this gives you the idea 

you can take one toothpick and you can make d z squared 

putting on your orbitals you have your donut in the middle 

and then your two lobes which run along the zaxis 

and then for your other sets of orbitals you can take these 

two toothpicks and put on these sets of mini marshmallows and 

handily you can just have one for all of the other d 

orbitals because depending on how you hold it it can 

represent all of the other d orbitals just very well 

so you can just have one of these for all the others 

and then your d z squared 

so what were going to do when we have our orbitals set up 


then we can think about how ligands in particular 

positions in particular geometries would clash with our 

orbitals  where thered be big repulsions or 

small repulsions 

so any other people missing their jelly beans or 

their marshmallows 

please raise your hand we have extras 

so those of you who have them go ahead and start 

making your d orbitals 

all right so if youre finished with your two d 

orbitals you can start making an octahedral complex 

so in your geometries set youll have a big gum which can 

be your center metal  youll have a big jelly bean  sorry 

big jelly beans and small jelly beans are our ligands or our 

negative point charges and you can set up and make an 

octahedral geometry here 

ok so as youre finishing this up im going to review what we 

talked about before the exam  so this isnt in todays 

lecture handouts it was in last time which we 

already went over 

but sometimes ive discovered that when theres an exam in 

the middle there needs to be a bit of a refresher its hard 

to remember what happened before the exam and you 

have your models to think about this 

so before the exam we had talked about the octahedral 

case and how compared to a spherical situation where the 

ligands are everywhere distributed around the metals 


where all d orbitals would be affectedrepulsed by the 

ligands in a symmetric fashion equally when you have them put 

as particular positions in geometry then theyre going to 

affect the different d orbitals differently 

and so if you have your d z squared made and you have your 

octahedral made you can sort of hold these up and realize 

that you would have repulsion from your ligands along the 

zaxis directly toward your orbitals from d z squared 

so that would be highly repulsive 

the ligands are along the zaxis the d orbitals are 

along the zaxis so the ligands the negative point 

charge ligands are going to be pointing right 

toward your orbitals 

and if you hold up this as a d x squared y squared orbital 

where the orbitals are right along the xaxis and right 

along the yaxis and you hold that up remember your ligands 

are right along the xaxis and right along the yaxis 

so you should also have significant repulsion for d x 

squared minus y squared and octahedrally oriented ligands 

in contrast the ligands set that are  degrees offaxis 

so d y z d x z and d x y theyre all  degrees off 

your ligands are along the axis but your orbitals 

are  degrees offaxis 

so if you look at that together youll see that 

whichever one you look at the ligands are not going to be 


pointing directly toward those d orbitals 

the orbitals are offaxis ligands are onaxis 

so there will be much smaller repulsions there 

and that we talked about the fact that for d x squared minus 

y squared and d z squared theyre both have experienced 

large repulsions theyre both degenerate in energy they go 

up in energy whereas these three d orbitals smaller 

repulsion and theyre also degenerate with respect to each 

other and theyre stabilized compared to these guys up here 


so you can try to hold those up and convince yourself that 

thats true for the octahedral case 

so thats what we talked about last time and now we want to 

 oh and ill just remind you we looked at these splitting 

diagrams as well 

we looked at the average energy of the d orbitals  d z 

squared and d x squared minus y squared go up in energy 

and then the other three d orbitals go down in energy 

so now we want to consider what happens with 

different geometries 

so now you can turn your octahedral case into a 

square planar case and how am i going to do that 


yeah so we can just take off the top and the bottom and we 

have our nice square planar case and try to make a 

tetrahedral complex as well 

and heres an example of a tetrahedral one 

again you can take a jelly bean in the middle and big 

jelly bean and then the smaller ones on the outside 

so what angles am i going for here in the tetrahedral case 

  

 

so you can go ahead and make your tetrahedral complex 

and dont worry so much about the   

 but well see if people can do a good job with the  

ok how are your tetrahedral complexes coming 

do they look like this sort of 

so let me define for you how were going to consider 

the tetrahedral case 

so in the tetrahedral case were going to have the xaxis 

comes out of the plane the yaxis is this way zaxis 


again up and down 

were going to have one ligand coming out here another going 

back and then these two are pretty much in the 

plane of the screen 

so this is sort of how im holding the tetrahedral complex 

with respect to the x z and y coordinate system 

so there is a splitting energy splitting associated 

with tetrahedral and its going to be smaller than 


octahedral because none of these ligands will be pointing 

directly toward the orbitals 

but lets consider which orbitals are going to be most 

affected by a tetrahedral case 

so lets consider d z squared 

what do you think 

is that going to be particularly  are the ligands 

pointing toward d z squared 

no 

and d x squared minus y squared we can think of 

what about that one 

no not really 

what about d x y d y z and d x y 

moreso 

so if you try holding up your tetrahedral in our coordinate 

system and then hold your d orbitals  degrees offaxis 

its not perfect theyre not pointing directly toward them 

but its a little closer than for the d orbitals that 

are directly onaxis 

so if we look at this we see that the orbitals are going to 

be split in the exact opposite way of the octahedral system 

in the octahedral system the ligands are onaxis so the 

orbitals that are onaxis d x squared minus y squared and d 

z squared are going to be the most affected 

but with tetrahedral the ligands are offaxis so the 

d orbitals that are also offaxis are going to 

be the most affected 

but theyre not going to be as dramatically affected so the 

splitting is actually smaller in this case 

so here with tetrahedral you have the opposite of 

the octahedral system 

and you can keep these and try to convince yourself 

of that later if you have trouble visualizing it 

so youll have more repulsion between the ligands as negative 


point charges and the d orbitals that are  degrees 

offaxis than you do with the two d orbitals 

that are onaxis 

so here d x squared minus y squared and d z squared have 

the same energy with respect to each other theyre degenerate 

and we have our d y z x z and x y have the same energy 

with respect to each other they are also degenerate 

so its the same sets that are degenerate as with 

octahedral but theyre all affected differently 


so now lets look at the energy diagrams and compare the 

octahedral system with the tetrahedral system 

remember an octahedral we had the two orbitals going 

up and three going down 

the splitting the energy difference between 

them was abbreviated 

the octahedral crystal field splitting energy with a 

little o for octahedral 

we now have a t for tetrahedral so we have 

a different name 

and so here is now our tetrahedral set 


you notice its the opposite of octahedral so the orbitals 

that were most destabilized in the octahedral case are now 

more stabilized down here so weve moved down in energy 

and the orbitals that are offaxis  degrees offaxis 

which were stabilized in the octahedral system because none 

of ligands were pointing right toward them now those ligands 

are a bit closer so they jump up in energy and so we have 

this swap between the two 

so we have some new labels as well 

so we had e g up here as an abbreviation for these sets 

of orbitals and now thats just referred to as e 


notice the book in one place has an e  but uses e in all 

the other places so just use e the e  was a 

mistake in the book 

and then we have t  g becomes t  up here 

so we have this slightly different nomenclature and we 

have this flip in direction 

so the other thing that is important to emphasize is that 

the tetrahedral splitting energy is smaller because none 


of those ligands are pointing directly toward any 

of the d orbitals 

so here there is a much larger difference here there is a 

smaller difference so thats why its written much closer 

together so thats smaller 

and because of that many tetrahedral complexes are high 

spin and in this course you can assume that theyre 

all high spin 

so that means theres a weak field theres not a big 

energy difference between those orbital sets 

and again were going to  since were going to consider 


how much they go up and down in energy the overall 

energy is maintained 

so here we had two orbitals going up by  three 

orbitals going down by  

so here we have three orbitals going up so theyll go up in 

energy by  two orbitals go down so theyll be going 

down in energy by  

so again its the opposite of the octahedral system 

its opposite pretty much in every way except that the 

splitting energy is much smaller its not as large 

for the tetrahedral complex 

all right so lets look at an example and were going to 

consider a chromium and like we did before we have to first 

figure out the d count so we have chromium plus  

so what is our d count here 

you know where chromium is what its group number  

here is a periodic table 


so what is the d count 

 

so we have  minus    a d  system 

and now why dont you tell me how you would fill in those 

three electrons in a tetrahedral case 

have a clicker question there 

so notice that in addition to having electron configurations 

that are different the d orbitals are labelled 

differently 

ok  more seconds 

ok very good  

so lets take a look at that 

so down here were going to have then our d x squared minus 

y squared d z squared orbitals up in the top we have 

x y and x z and y z 

again the orbitals that are onaxis are repelled a little 


less than the orbitals that are offaxis in a tetrahedral case 

and then we put in our electrons we start down here 

and then one of the questions is do we keep down here and 

pair up or go up here and the answer is that you 

would go up here 

does someone want to tell me why they think thats true 

yeah 

inaudible 

right because it has a smaller splitting energy 

so the way that we were deciding before with the weak 


field and the strong field if its a weak field it doesnt 

take much energy to put it up there 

so you go they dont want to be paired theres energy 

associated with pairing 

but if theres a really huge splitting energy then it takes 

less energy to pair them up before you go that big 

distance up there 

but in tetrahedral cases the splitting energys always 

small so youre just going to always fill them up singly 

to the fullest extent possible before you pair 

so this is like a weak field case for the octahedral system 

and all tetrahedral complexes are sort of the equivalent of 

the weak field because the splitting energy is always 

small in an octahedral case because none of the ligands 


negative point charges are really pointing toward any of 

those orbitals that much so its not that big a difference 

so here we have this and now we can practice writing our d 

to the n electron configuration 

so what do i put here 

what do i put first 

so we put the e and then what 

yup 

there are two electrons in the e set of orbitals and in the 


t  orbitals theres one 

so that is our d n electron configuration 

and then were also asked how many unpaired electrons 

unpaired electrons and that is three 

all right 

so thats not too bad thats the tetrahedral case 

the hardest part is probably making your 

tetrahedral complex 

now square planar 

so again with the square planar set you have your square 

planar model  we have a bigger one down here 

and the axes is defined such that we have ligands right 

along x  one coming out at you and one going back and 

also ligands right along the yaxis 


so as defined then weve gotten rid of our ligands 

along the zaxis 

so what do you predict 

which two of these will be the most destabilized now 

what would be the most destabilized what 

do you guess 

you can hold up your little sets here 

whats the most destabilized whats going to go up 

the most in energy here 

yeah d z squared minus y squared 

what do you predict might be next in terms of 

most unfavorable 

yeah the x y one 

so these two now are going to be the most destabilized with 

d x squared minus y squared being a lot more destabilized 

than just the x y because again those d orbitals 

are onaxis and these ligands are onaxis 

so lets take a look at all of these again 

so in the octahedral case these were degenerate 

thats no longer true because there are no ligands 

along the zaxis anymore 

so we took those off in going from the octahedral to the 

square planar so you have much less repulsion but with the d 

x squared minus y squared you still have a lot repulsion 

so then if we start building up our case and this diagram is 

i think on the next page of your handout but im going to 

start building it all up together 

so now d x squared y squared is really high up its very 

much more destabilized than anybody else 

d z squared on the other hand is down 

its not  it would be stabilized compared  its 

not nearly as destabilized as the other system 

so then we go back and look at these 

you told me that d x y would probably be next and 

thats a very good guess 

you see you have more repulsion than in the other two because 

the other orbitals have some z component in them 

so you have less repulsion than d x squared minus y squared 

because its  degrees off but still that one is probably 


going to be up a little bit more in energy than 

the other set 

these two here are stabilized compared to the others so 

theyre somewhere down here 

now the exact sort of arrangement can vary a little 

bit but the important points are that the d x squared minus 

y squared is the most destabilized d x y would be 

next and the other are much lower in energy 

and were not going to do this how much up and down thing 

like the  and the  because its more 


complicated in this case 

so just the basic rationale you need to know here not the 

exact energy differences in this particular case 

ok so now weve thought about three different kinds of 

geometries  octahedral tetrahedral and 

the square planar 

you should be able to rationalize for any 

geometry that i give you what would be true 


if i tell you the geometry and how it compares with our frame 

with our axis frame of where the zaxis is you should be 

able to tell me which orbital sets would be 

the most destabilized 

and to give you practice why dont you try 

this one right here 

so we have a square pyramidal case as drawn here with the 

axes labeled z y and x coming in and coming out 

tell me which of the following statements are true 

and if you want you can take your square planar and turn it 

into the geometry to help you out 

lets just take  more seconds 

all right 

that was good 

people did well on that question 

so if we consider that we had the top two are correct 

so if we consider the d z squared now weve put a ligand 

along z so that is going to cause that to be more 

destabilized for this geometry rather than square planar 


which doesnt have anything in the z direction ah and then in 

terms also other orbitals that have a component along z 

are going to be affected a little bit by that but our 

other one here is not going to be true so we just have all of 

the above is not correct so we have this one 

so if we had up those thats actually a pretty good score 

and so you could think about say what would be true of a 

complex that was linear along z what would be the most 

stabilized for example 

so these are the kinds of questions you can get and 

i think there are a few on the problemset 

all right so lets come back together now and talk 

about magnetism again 

so we said in the beginning that magnetism can be used to 


figure out geometry in say a metal cluster in an enzyme and 

lets give an example of how that could be true 

so suppose you have a nickel plus  system so that would be 

a d  system so we have group  minus  or d  and it was 

found to be diamagnetic 

and from that we may be able to guess using these kinds of 

diagrams whether it has square planar geometry 

tetrahedral geometry or octahedral geometry 

we can predict the geometry based on that information 

lets think about how thats true 

we have a d  system 

think about octahedral for a minute 

are there two options for how this might look in this case 

is there going to be a difference in electron 

configurations if its a weak field or a strong field 

so write it out on your handout and tell me whether 


it would be true think about it both ways 

is there a difference 

so you would end up getting the same thing 

in this particular case 

so if its a weak field and you put in    then jump 

up here   and then you have to come back    

or you could pair up all the ones on the bottom first and 

then go up there but you actually get the same result no 


matter which way you put them in the diagram looks the same 

so it doesnt matter in this case if it is a weak or strong 

field you end up with those number of electrons with the 

exact same configuration 

so we know what that looks like 

well what about square planar 

so lets put our electrons in there 

well start at the bottom well just put them in 

im not going to worry too much about whether we can jump up or 

not well just go and pair them up as we go down here and 

then go up here and now weve put in our eight electrons 

so how close these are were just going to put them all in 

were just going to be very careful not to bump up any 

electrons there unless we absolutely have to because d x 

squared minus y squared is very much more destabilized in the 

square planar system so were going to want to pair all 

our electrons up in those lower energy orbitals 

so even if we sort of did it a different way 

thats what we would get 

so were going to want to pair everything up before we go 

up to that top one there 

so theres our square planar 

well what about tetrahedral 

how are we going to fill these up 

do we want to pair first or we do want to put them to the 

full extent possible singly 

single right its going to be a weak field theres not a big 

splitting here between these so well put them in theres 

        

all right so now we can consider which of these will 

be paramagnetic and which will be diamagnetic 

whats octahedral 

its paramagnetic we have unpaired electrons 

what about square planar 

square planars diamagnetic 

and what about tetrahedral 

paramagnetic 

so if the experimental data told us that a nickel center in 

an enzyme was diamagnetic and we were trying to decide 

between those three geometries it really seems like square 

planar is going to be our best guess 


and so let me show you an example of a 

square planar system 

and so this particular nickel is in a square planar system 

it has four ligands that are all in the same plane and it 

is a square planar center for a nickel so thats one example 

and this is a cluster thats involved in life 

on carbon dioxide 

all right so thats different geometries 

youre set with that 

monday were going to talk about colors of coordination 

complexes which all have to do with the different geometries
