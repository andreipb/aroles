how much they go up and down in energy the overall 

energy is maintained 

so here we had two orbitals going up by  three 

orbitals going down by  

so here we have three orbitals going up so theyll go up in 

energy by  two orbitals go down so theyll be going 

down in energy by  

so again its the opposite of the octahedral system 

its opposite pretty much in every way except that the 

splitting energy is much smaller its not as large 

for the tetrahedral complex 

all right so lets look at an example and were going to 

consider a chromium and like we did before we have to first 

figure out the d count so we have chromium plus  

so what is our d count here 

you know where chromium is what its group number  

here is a periodic table 


so what is the d count 

 

so we have  minus    a d  system 

and now why dont you tell me how you would fill in those 

three electrons in a tetrahedral case 

have a clicker question there 

so notice that in addition to having electron configurations 

that are different the d orbitals are labelled 

differently 

ok  more seconds 

ok very good  

so lets take a look at that 

so down here were going to have then our d x squared minus 

y squared d z squared orbitals up in the top we have 

x y and x z and y z 

again the orbitals that are onaxis are repelled a little 


less than the orbitals that are offaxis in a tetrahedral case 

and then we put in our electrons we start down here 

and then one of the questions is do we keep down here and 

pair up or go up here and the answer is that you 

would go up here 

does someone want to tell me why they think thats true 

yeah 

inaudible 

right because it has a smaller splitting energy 

so the way that we were deciding before with the weak 


field and the strong field if its a weak field it doesnt 

take much energy to put it up there 

so you go they dont want to be paired theres energy 

associated with pairing 

but if theres a really huge splitting energy then it takes 

less energy to pair them up before you go that big 

distance up there 

but in tetrahedral cases the splitting energys always 

small so youre just going to always fill them up singly 

to the fullest extent possible before you pair 

so this is like a weak field case for the octahedral system 

and all tetrahedral complexes are sort of the equivalent of 

the weak field because the splitting energy is always 

small in an octahedral case because none of the ligands 


negative point charges are really pointing toward any of 

those orbitals that much so its not that big a difference 

so here we have this and now we can practice writing our d 

to the n electron configuration 

so what do i put here 

what do i put first 

so we put the e and then what 

yup 

there are two electrons in the e set of orbitals and in the 


t  orbitals theres one 

so that is our d n electron configuration 

and then were also asked how many unpaired electrons 

unpaired electrons and that is three 

all right 

so thats not too bad thats the tetrahedral case 

the hardest part is probably making your 

tetrahedral complex 

now square planar 

so again with the square planar set you have your square 

planar model  we have a bigger one down here 

and the axes is defined such that we have ligands right 

along x  one coming out at you and one going back and 

also ligands right along the yaxis 


so as defined then weve gotten rid of our ligands 

along the zaxis 

so what do you predict 

which two of these will be the most destabilized now 

what would be the most destabilized what 

do you guess 

you can hold up your little sets here 

whats the most destabilized whats going to go up 

the most in energy here 

yeah d z squared minus y squared 

what do you predict might be next in terms of 

most unfavorable 

yeah the x y one 

so these two now are going to be the most destabilized with 

d x squared minus y squared being a lot more destabilized 

than just the x y because again those d orbitals 

are onaxis and these ligands are onaxis 

so lets take a look at all of these again 

so in the octahedral case these were degenerate 

thats no longer true because there are no ligands 

along the zaxis anymore 

so we took those off in going from the octahedral to the 

square planar so you have much less repulsion but with the d 

x squared minus y squared you still have a lot repulsion 

so then if we start building up our case and this diagram is 

i think on the next page of your handout but im going to 

start building it all up together 

so now d x squared y squared is really high up its very 

much more destabilized than anybody else 

d z squared on the other hand is down 

its not  it would be stabilized compared  its 

not nearly as destabilized as the other system 

so then we go back and look at these 

you told me that d x y would probably be next and 

thats a very good guess 

you see you have more repulsion than in the other two because 

the other orbitals have some z component in them 

so you have less repulsion than d x squared minus y squared 

because its  degrees off but still that one is probably 


going to be up a little bit more in energy than 

the other set 

these two here are stabilized compared to the others so 

theyre somewhere down here 

now the exact sort of arrangement can vary a little 

bit but the important points are that the d x squared minus 

y squared is the most destabilized d x y would be 

next and the other are much lower in energy 

and were not going to do this how much up and down thing 

like the  and the  because its more 


complicated in this case 

so just the basic rationale you need to know here not the 

exact energy differences in this particular case 

ok so now weve thought about three different kinds of 

geometries  octahedral tetrahedral and 

the square planar 

you should be able to rationalize for any 

geometry that i give you what would be true 


if i tell you the geometry and how it compares with our frame 

with our axis frame of where the zaxis is you should be 

able to tell me which orbital sets would be 

the most destabilized 

and to give you practice why dont you try 

this one right here 

so we have a square pyramidal case as drawn here with the 

axes labeled z y and x coming in and coming out 

tell me which of the following statements are true 

and if you want you can take your square planar and turn it 

into the geometry to help you out 

lets just take  more seconds 

all right 

that was good 

people did well on that question 

so if we consider that we had the top two are correct 

so if we consider the d z squared now weve put a ligand 

along z so that is going to cause that to be more 

destabilized for this geometry rather than square planar
