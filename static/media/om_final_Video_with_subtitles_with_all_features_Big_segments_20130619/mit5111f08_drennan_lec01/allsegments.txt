welcome to  and today what were going to 

do is introduce you to the course and the people 

teaching the course 

and were also going to let you know that you were going to be 

part of the great web exercise that is ocw opencourseware 

so this course is being videotaped this year and 

this is the announcement that i have to make 

so the videotape is in the back and if you want to come 

up front and participate in the class you know that youll be 

videotaped  if you want to hide your face or whatever you 

can do that but please pay attention to the 

lectures anyway 

so this course will be available on the ocw site 

in the future im not sure exactly what that 

date is going to be 

so today were going to introduce the chemistry topics 


which we will cover in  and give you general 

information practical information about the course 

number of points you need when the exams are that kind of 

thing policies and introduce you to the teaching staff 

i am again professor cathy drennen and im one of the 

lecturers in this course 

so because this is mit were going to start to quiz 


ok not a quiz for points or anything dont freak out 

but i do want you to tell me who these people are 

so what about this person 

thats me  this is my college yearbook photo 

ok what about this person over here 

you 

its not me again 

not elizabeth taylor 

it is lisa kudrow known as phoebe on friends so we 

both went to college at the same time we went to 

the same college 

does anybody know what college that was 

vassar 

vassar college very good 

and we graduated the same year  now no one has to say what 

year that was even if you know but we did 

graduate the same year 

all right 

so given what you know about us what do you think lisa 

went to college to study 

computer 

computers 

no 

theatre 

theatre 

surprisingly no 

nuclear engineering 

nuclear engineering at vassar no for a 

variety of reasons 

any other guesses 

english 

english no 

biology  i heard it 

biology 

what do you think i went to college to study 

theatre 

theatre correct 

andor i hadnt made up my mind exactly  

biopsychology or drama 

so biopsychology was what they called sort of brain and 

cognitive sciences in those days 

so those were the two things i was thinking about 

what do you think lisa ended up majoring in college 


biopsychology 

not biopsychology 

biology 

biology yes 

what do you think i majored in college 

this should be a bit easier 

chemistry 

chemistry and of course our professions 

actress and chemistry professor 

so let me ask what happened here 

my understanding about lisa kudrow is that she came 

from a hollywood family 

she went to college and said heres my opportunity to study 


the thing that i find most interesting and that was 

biology and then she went back and participated in the family 

business which was of course the acting profession 

for me what happened 

well i have to say i did not like chemistry in high school 

so i did not think about going to college to study chemistry 

so why did i not like chemistry in high school 

i think it was because of images such as this one 

you spend a lot of time talking about the transition between 

alchemy and modern chemistry 

i wasnt very interested in that kind of thing and theres 

nothing in these photographs that really appealed 

to me personally 

i mean avogadro  im fond of his number and he is in 

fact an interesting if not frightening looking man  this 

just didnt connect with me 

but then i got to college and they said well if youre 

thinking about anything bio  biopsychology biology  you 


have to take chemistry and i said to my advisor no no 

i have taken chemistry in high school and i can assure you 

that chemistry has no relevance whatsoever to the life 

sciences and they said well im sorry you feel that 

way its incorrect and you have to take it anyway 

so i like some of you in this room took freshman chemistry 

because we had to not because we wanted to 

and i like hopefully some of you in this room discovered 


that chemistry was actually a lot of fun and that the 

chemistry i got in college was pretty much nothing like the 

chemistry i had seen in high school 

so let me introduce you to some of the topics we are 

going to be covering in chemistry this semester 

so theres more detail on your syllabus  a detail of what 

well cover every day but these are the kind of basic 


things that were covering and you dont need to write this 

down youll become familiar with it as 

the semester goes on 

we start out with some really basic principles 

so up here atomic theory periodic table bonding 

structures and molecules 

and there will be a little bit of history in there but this 

is mostly modern chemistry and represents the basic properties 

of matter and its basic properties of all matter 

including living matter which was what really interested me 

that connection between chemistry and biology 

so then we go to thermodynamics and chemical 

equilibrium and this is really about chemical reactions  

weather a reaction will go will it be spontaneous if 

there an equilibrium what direction will the 

reaction be shifted in 

and then of course not just whether the reaction will 

occur but how fast it occurs is really important 

so thats kinetics  how fast a reaction will go and from 

the perspective of someone whos a biochemist im 

interested in kinetics and enzyme kinetics and thinking 

about molecules that catalyze reactions in the body 

and then theres acid base equilibrium and also oxidation 

reduction reactions and what is true is that most reactions 

that occur are either catalyzed by either some kind of acid 

base catalysis or involve some kind of oxidation reduction 

reaction and so this sort of represents a lot of the basic 

way reactions go  now whether thats a reaction in 

your body or a reaction in a test tube  it doesnt 

matter a lot of the same principles are involved 


and then we also cover transition metals which is 

something that you often dont see in high school 

and transition metals those all medals in the middle of 

your periodic table have some really unique properties which 

are exploited again in reactions that occur in your 

body and also are utilized in industry for example so well 

talk about some of those unique properties 

and if we put all of that together we get the real 


fundamentals that you need to go on and study  any 

kind of curriculum that involves chemistry 

so these are all the fundamentals that are involved 

in chemistry that relate to physical chemistry organic 

chemistry inorganic chemistry biological chemistry and are a 

solid foundation for studying any kind of life science 

so i congratulate you of being here in this class this is 

really good solid foundation for whatever you go on 

to do here at mit 

so normally at this point we do actually start class with a 

little bit of history from alchemy to modern chemistry 

but i decided to skip that this year 

if you are interested in that its never required on any 


test it never has been but if youre interested in that there 

is an ocw lecture which you can listen to thats an 

excellent lecture by professor sylvia ceyer on that 

but today instead i thought i would give you some examples of 

modern chemistry  why people now need to know chemistry 

what theyre doing with chemistry what is chemistry 

research here at mit and how does it utilize these basic 

principles which well be talking about in the course 


so ill start with my colleague professor 

joanne stubbe 

she studies molecules in particular she studies 

biological molecules 

and so one of the things shes very interested in is how this 

anticancer drug gemcitabine works in the body 

so it inhibits an enzyme and shes interested in knowing 

how that really works 

so enzymes are made up of amino acids you have long 

chains of amino acids that form together into a protein 

molecules protein molecules in your body often act as enzymes 

catalyzing reactions 

so she is interested in how this molecule gemcitabine 

inhibits an enzyme 

so to do those studies she needs to know a lot of 

the stuff on this list 

of course she needs to know the basic principles but shes 

also talking about it an enzyme so she needs to know 

about enzyme catalysis 

she needs to know this enzyme works by both 

acid base chemistry and oxidation reduction 

it has two irons that are involved in doing the 

chemistry so it includes transition metals 

she thinks about how things bind how the natural reactants 


binds how the inhibitor binds and so she needs to know what 

happens to the chemical equilibrium she needs to know 

about the thermodynamics of those binding events and of 

course everything all the basic principles 

are required here 

so to do this biochemistry research she needs to know all 

of these things and she has really made tremendous progress 

in understanding how gemcitabine works and it is 

not so toxic so its a really good thing to have 


in chemotherapy 

so in addition to studying molecules chemists often want 

to make molecules such as tim jamison whos an 

organic chemist 

so you will hear probably hopefully in this presidential 

debate about the environment and about why saving the 

environment is important 

and one of the things you often hear about in this discussion 

is about our oceans and about rainforests and part of the 

reason why people want to protect those areas is because 

you find a lot of natural products in those regions 

so a natural product is something that is made by 

nature and often natural products whether it comes from 

a plant or a marine organism have some really good 

useful properties 

and so one particular compound has antitumor properties 

so again along this line of cancer research 

so tim jamisons lab figured out how to make this thing 

and often thats really important because you cant 

get enough of the organism that naturally makes it to be able 

to grind that organism up and have enough that you can 

actually use as a medicine 

so you have to make more of it because nature 


doesnt make enough 

so its very important to figure out how to do that 

so in doing that tim jamisons lab needs a 

lot of these things 

so he needs a lot of knowledge of bonding he wants to 

form bonds in making this 

he needs to know about the structures of the molecules 

because if the structure is wrong its not going to work 


and often if you want to make a lot of it you have to think 

about the thermodynamics of the system how fast the reactions 

will go and kinetics and then whether theyll go the 

thermodynamics and sometimes then you need to adjust the 

reactions maybe use a transition metal to 

make it go better 

so these are all the things that tim jamison needs to know 

to do organic chemistry 

so youll be learning in this class a great preparation 

for  which is organic chemistry 

in addition to studying molecules and making molecules 

some chemists want to detect molecules and a chemist who 

likes to detect molecules is tim swager 

so tim swagers lab has designed sensors that detect 

vapors and so they will detect tnt for example 

and so he has put this chemistry to use in this 

robotic arm and they call it fido because often dogs are 

the creatures that have to go out and detect these things 

and its not a great job if youre a dog to be sent out to 

see whether there was an explosive and discover yes 

there was a little bit too late 

so this is a much nicer way to detect chemicals with this 

robotic arm and heres a picture of it in use in iraq 


so in doing this if you go down to kind of a basic 

principles that tim needed to know about oxidation reduction 

was really key in developing this technology so 

well talk about that 

so my final example is from alan davidsons lab and alan 

is an inorganic chemist  he loved those transition metals 

and theyre unique properties and he designed this compound 


its called cardiolite and its used in heart imaging 

so many people have relatives they know of that have had to 

have their heart imaged  heart disease is a major 

problem in the united states and theres a good chance that 

they had cardiolite given to them to help in that 

imaging process 

so this again takes advantage of those great unique 

properties of transition metals which well talk 

about in this course 

so again all together this is the basis for modern 

chemistry and examples i just gave you are some of the 

things that modern chemists are working on  some of the 

issues that our country faces and our world faces and how 

chemistry is involved in that 

so not only will you have the fundamental knowledge to go on 


and take more courses in chemistry you will also have 

the fundamental knowledge to go on and do undergraduate 

research here and here are some of the  undergraduate 

researchers that have come through my lab in 

particular from this class 

so its a really nice solid foundation 

so i want to encourage you to set some of your likes and 

dislikes from high school aside when you come to mit because 

at mit you often see disciplines taught and 

emphasize a very different fashion than what 

youve seen before 

and you may discover that the thing you came here to study is 

not the thing that you really want to study after all 

one other thing that ill say to you is that i said these 

words at one point its true i said when i was in high 

school i said i hate chemistry and now i do 

chemistry every day and will for the rest my life 

i love chemistry now 

be very careful what you say 

have any of you made that statement about 

hating a subject 

tell me later what it is youre going to be doing 

for the rest of your life 

so at mit things are very different and keep an open 

mind explore new areas  take advantage of being at this 

amazing place for science and technology and you may surprise 

yourself in what you really enjoy learning about 


so thats a little bit about the chemistry that were going 

to cover in this class and now im going to talk a little 

bit about some of the policies and procedures 

but first i need to introduce my coinstructor for this 

class and let me just put up her picture youll 

see her in a minute 

so dr beth vogel taylor 

so all chemistry courses are team taught so you have a 

different lecturer for the first half than the second 

half and dr taylor will be doing most of the first half 

lectures and ill be doing most of the second 

half lectures 

so dr taylor will take you from atomic theory through 

thermodynamics and ill start up with chemical equilibrium 

talk to about kinetics acid base oxidation reduction 

and transition metals 

so you will have both of us as lecturers in this class 

now in the past sometimes students have found this whole 

thing a little frustrating that they just get used to one 

lecture style and then all of a sudden theres another 

lecture style and that can be true 

i mean sometimes the styles of the two professors couldnt 


be more different  think mccainpalin odd couples 

sometimes theyre more similar and when i first about a year 

and a half ago got to know dr taylor we sort of realized 

that we had very similar styles and we got very excited 

about the idea that we could teach together so that there 

would be much more continuity throughout the semester 

and so dr taylor had been teaching the first half of the 

material in the spring and i had been teaching the second 

half of the material in the fall and we thought wouldnt 

it be great if we got together and taught in the fall 


so this was actually for a variety of reasons a very 

complicated thing to request and do and so we started a 

campaign and campaigned for a year and a half that we should 

be allowed to do this course together and finally just a 

few weeks ago in august  we really didnt know up until 

almost when this course started  that permission was granted 


so i have to say i am very excited now to introduce you to 

dr taylor who i would be teaching with this semester  

limited engagement  who will tell you about some of 

the course policies 

okay so before we get to some of these course 

policies i think ill tell you a little bit about my path 

to chemistry as well 

professor drennen explained that not everyone that ends up 

as a chemist started off that way on their first class 

freshman year for example in chemistry 


and in fact if you talk to a lot of chemists if you talk to 

some of the graduate students maybe your ta youll find that 

that phrase i hate chemistry has maybe been 

uttered by more than one us at some point in our lives before 

we realized and once it happens you dont go back that 

actually you love chemistry and its hard to even remember a 

point where you didnt see all of these connections that 

it provided for you 

to give a little background of where i was sitting where 

maybe you are today on the first day of chemistry when i 

left high school i had no interest in chemistry 

whatsoever 

and i have only one strong memory from high school 

chemistry and that memory is shown right here and 

that is the common ions 

did you guys have to learn the common ions 

does anyone have that in their brain somewhere for ready use 


i dont in fact so its actually okay if you dont 

know all your common ions if you missed that part 

this is the strongest memory i have and i remembered a that 

i didnt learn them and that was really bad because it kept 

coming up but the other thing i remember is that i had no 

idea why they were important 

i didnt really understand what any of these molecules were 

i certainly didnt understand how they even connected really 

to chemical reactions much less other disciplines 


that i was interested in 

i couldnt have told you for example if we look at a 

phosphate group that thats going to be incredibly 

important in dna that its also an incredibly important 

group when youre dealing with proteins and whether youre 

turning the function of a protein on or off 

so really i just had no context for the chemistry 

so when i started in college that wasnt even an option for 

me and i was interested in a lot of things chemistry 

not being one 

but one that i was very interested in was biology and 

the reason was we did a lot of cool labs in high school i 

loved doing the dissections  it was very interesting to me 

to think about how different organs worked how the heart 

could be a pump how the lungs worked 

and then when we got to more of a cellular level it was even 


more interesting to see that we could actually understand how 

our body worked as low of a level as thinking about cells 

and so that was a clear major for me to pick  i actually 

also was considering english and ended up being a 

minor in english 

but i think what most of you actually having come to mit 

have probably realized is sometimes its nice to major in 

a science because you cant just pick up a reaction and do 

it in your kitchen on the weekend where as you can 

sometimes join a book group and do that 

so its kind of nice to major in the thing that youre going 

to get to have the opportunity to do for the rest 

of your life 

so i actually also started premed 

is anyone else premed here 

okay so a pretty good showing 

so maybe you can relate to some of the reasons i wanted to be 


pretty premed  part of it was the interest in the 

science and the biology 

also i wanted to help people  it seemed like a really 

clear way that i could have a career that was challenging 

and involved in science but also helping others 

so it seemed like a good start for me premedbio and i 

signed up for my bio class  i found out as professor drennen 

did that i had to take chemistry as well 

i wasnt as upset i was sort of a neutral chemistry person 

at this point but i thought it was pretty smart to get it over 

with on the first semester so thats what i did 

and my plan was going along fine until something happened 

and what happened was that chemistry was just way more 


interesting than i anticipated 

so my perfect premedbio plan was getting a little shaken 

right from the start and the reason that it was getting 

taken was because i would learn this new principal in chemistry 

and because i was taking bio with the same time i could 

see the connections 

and at one point i realized oh my gosh chemistry is just 

biology its just looking at one level deeper so actually 

all of my interest in biology was quickly transferred to 

saying wow now i can think about things on the molecular 


level and one of the molecules that caught my 

attention first and i cant remember if this was freshman 

or sophomore year in high school was the first time i 

actually took meaning in looking at a chemical 

structure and that was with the structure of penicillin 

here and i know that all of you are familiar with 

penicillin whether or not you know the structure or not but 

the most important part of this structure is the fourmembered 

ring here the betalactam and this was the first time i 

thought i could actually understand how a molecule 

worked because i knew something about chemistry 

so for example with penicillin what it does is it inhibits an 

enzyme that builds the cell wall in bacteria the bacterial 

cell wall and if i thought about what id learned in 

chemistry  some of you know this from high school some of 

you will be very familiar with this soon is that this 

carbon here for example is bonded to three things 

does anyone know what angle those would like to be at 

 

they want to get as far away from each other possible 

the ideal angle is  

but what we have here is a fourmembered ring so what 


angle does that have to be that bond 

 degrees 

so we have a problem here if were thinking about keeping 

things at the lowest energy so theres a lot of ring 

strain in the system 

and i was incredibly excited that i could look at that and 

realize it and say wow thats why its so reactive thats 

why its such a good medication because when it 

comes into contact with these bacterial cell wall building 

enzyme the enzyme can actually react with this fourmembered 

ring and open up the ring and relieve that ring strain 

so now the angles can open up all the way to  if it wants 

to and theres no way its going to form that ring again 

right because its not going to back to those  degree 

angles if it can help it 

so now the enzyme is locked up with the penicillin molecule 

no more bacterial cell wall being built and the 

penicillin has effectively killed the bacteria 

so that for me was kind of the first connection that what 


went woah wait a second i want to be thinking about these 

molecules all the way down to the level of individual atoms 

so at this point kept the premed just switched 

the major to chemistry 

the next problem came up when i went and took 

organic chemistry 

so if youre dead set on staying with bio maybe i 

guess you have to take organic so this might happen to 


you just to warn you 

we started looking at all sorts of other kinds of 

molecules that became very interesting to me 

i especially love thinking about vitamins and drugs 

because i do have that interest in medicine and human health 

these are actually all examples that well talk about in 

freshman chemistry at some point as an example of a 

connection between a chemical principle we learn and what we 

can know about how it functions 

but what happened here was i thought oh my gosh now i 

could actually using my chemical knowledge think about 

synthesizing these molecules or maybe coming up with new 

ways to synthesize them better or synthesize 

different molecules 

and the real clincher was when i started doing some 

undergraduate research 

any potential urops out there  anyone planning to do 

a research at some point 

excellent 

okay 

so just to be warned you might fall in love with the 

subject you do your urop in 

this is one of our summer students from this past 

summer who is also premed 

shes continuing to be premed which is fantastic 

that didnt happen to me  once i got into the lab 

i didnt want to leave 

so i thought you know what i think ill change the medical 

school plans and now im going to go all the way  chemistry 

major chemistry grad school and the reason i was able to do 

that and keep with what my original intentions were was to 

have a career that was the fulfilling in terms of helping 


people and being engaged in science is all of a sudden i 

realized as chemists we can think about better ways to 

build molecules that are important for making 

medications 

another thing we can do is we can use our chemistry to 

understand biological systems so we can help illucinate 

pathways maybe that are implicated in disease 

so the combination of these two things had made my decision 

and i ended up coming here for graduate school actually and 


working in professor imperialis lab doing 

bioorganic chemistry which means that i synthesize 

molecules which i loved and used them to study 

biological systems 

so really im pretty happy with what ive gotten to do 

and i just want to say were not trying to convert 

all of them you premed people by any means 

my roommate for many years was going to medical school as i 

was going to graduate school and we found we had so many
