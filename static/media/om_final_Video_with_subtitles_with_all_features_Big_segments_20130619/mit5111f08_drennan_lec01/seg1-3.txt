be more different  think mccainpalin odd couples 

sometimes theyre more similar and when i first about a year 

and a half ago got to know dr taylor we sort of realized 

that we had very similar styles and we got very excited 

about the idea that we could teach together so that there 

would be much more continuity throughout the semester 

and so dr taylor had been teaching the first half of the 

material in the spring and i had been teaching the second 

half of the material in the fall and we thought wouldnt 

it be great if we got together and taught in the fall 


so this was actually for a variety of reasons a very 

complicated thing to request and do and so we started a 

campaign and campaigned for a year and a half that we should 

be allowed to do this course together and finally just a 

few weeks ago in august  we really didnt know up until 

almost when this course started  that permission was granted 


so i have to say i am very excited now to introduce you to 

dr taylor who i would be teaching with this semester  

limited engagement  who will tell you about some of 

the course policies 

okay so before we get to some of these course 

policies i think ill tell you a little bit about my path 

to chemistry as well 

professor drennen explained that not everyone that ends up 

as a chemist started off that way on their first class 

freshman year for example in chemistry 


and in fact if you talk to a lot of chemists if you talk to 

some of the graduate students maybe your ta youll find that 

that phrase i hate chemistry has maybe been 

uttered by more than one us at some point in our lives before 

we realized and once it happens you dont go back that 

actually you love chemistry and its hard to even remember a 

point where you didnt see all of these connections that 

it provided for you 

to give a little background of where i was sitting where 

maybe you are today on the first day of chemistry when i 

left high school i had no interest in chemistry 

whatsoever 

and i have only one strong memory from high school 

chemistry and that memory is shown right here and 

that is the common ions 

did you guys have to learn the common ions 

does anyone have that in their brain somewhere for ready use 


i dont in fact so its actually okay if you dont 

know all your common ions if you missed that part 

this is the strongest memory i have and i remembered a that 

i didnt learn them and that was really bad because it kept 

coming up but the other thing i remember is that i had no 

idea why they were important 

i didnt really understand what any of these molecules were 

i certainly didnt understand how they even connected really 

to chemical reactions much less other disciplines 


that i was interested in 

i couldnt have told you for example if we look at a 

phosphate group that thats going to be incredibly 

important in dna that its also an incredibly important 

group when youre dealing with proteins and whether youre 

turning the function of a protein on or off 

so really i just had no context for the chemistry 

so when i started in college that wasnt even an option for 

me and i was interested in a lot of things chemistry 

not being one 

but one that i was very interested in was biology and 

the reason was we did a lot of cool labs in high school i 

loved doing the dissections  it was very interesting to me 

to think about how different organs worked how the heart 

could be a pump how the lungs worked 

and then when we got to more of a cellular level it was even 


more interesting to see that we could actually understand how 

our body worked as low of a level as thinking about cells 

and so that was a clear major for me to pick  i actually 

also was considering english and ended up being a 

minor in english 

but i think what most of you actually having come to mit 

have probably realized is sometimes its nice to major in 

a science because you cant just pick up a reaction and do 

it in your kitchen on the weekend where as you can 

sometimes join a book group and do that 

so its kind of nice to major in the thing that youre going 

to get to have the opportunity to do for the rest 

of your life 

so i actually also started premed 

is anyone else premed here 

okay so a pretty good showing 

so maybe you can relate to some of the reasons i wanted to be 


pretty premed  part of it was the interest in the 

science and the biology 

also i wanted to help people  it seemed like a really 

clear way that i could have a career that was challenging 

and involved in science but also helping others 

so it seemed like a good start for me premedbio and i 

signed up for my bio class  i found out as professor drennen 

did that i had to take chemistry as well 

i wasnt as upset i was sort of a neutral chemistry person 

at this point but i thought it was pretty smart to get it over 

with on the first semester so thats what i did 

and my plan was going along fine until something happened 

and what happened was that chemistry was just way more 


interesting than i anticipated 

so my perfect premedbio plan was getting a little shaken 

right from the start and the reason that it was getting 

taken was because i would learn this new principal in chemistry 

and because i was taking bio with the same time i could 

see the connections 

and at one point i realized oh my gosh chemistry is just 

biology its just looking at one level deeper so actually 

all of my interest in biology was quickly transferred to 

saying wow now i can think about things on the molecular 


level and one of the molecules that caught my 

attention first and i cant remember if this was freshman 

or sophomore year in high school was the first time i 

actually took meaning in looking at a chemical 

structure and that was with the structure of penicillin 

here and i know that all of you are familiar with 

penicillin whether or not you know the structure or not but 

the most important part of this structure is the fourmembered 

ring here the betalactam and this was the first time i 

thought i could actually understand how a molecule 

worked because i knew something about chemistry 

so for example with penicillin what it does is it inhibits an 

enzyme that builds the cell wall in bacteria the bacterial 

cell wall and if i thought about what id learned in 

chemistry  some of you know this from high school some of 

you will be very familiar with this soon is that this 

carbon here for example is bonded to three things 

does anyone know what angle those would like to be at 

 

they want to get as far away from each other possible 

the ideal angle is  

but what we have here is a fourmembered ring so what
