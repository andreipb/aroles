angle does that have to be that bond 

 degrees 

so we have a problem here if were thinking about keeping 

things at the lowest energy so theres a lot of ring 

strain in the system 

and i was incredibly excited that i could look at that and 

realize it and say wow thats why its so reactive thats 

why its such a good medication because when it 

comes into contact with these bacterial cell wall building 

enzyme the enzyme can actually react with this fourmembered 

ring and open up the ring and relieve that ring strain 

so now the angles can open up all the way to  if it wants 

to and theres no way its going to form that ring again 

right because its not going to back to those  degree 

angles if it can help it 

so now the enzyme is locked up with the penicillin molecule 

no more bacterial cell wall being built and the 

penicillin has effectively killed the bacteria 

so that for me was kind of the first connection that what 


went woah wait a second i want to be thinking about these 

molecules all the way down to the level of individual atoms 

so at this point kept the premed just switched 

the major to chemistry 

the next problem came up when i went and took 

organic chemistry 

so if youre dead set on staying with bio maybe i 

guess you have to take organic so this might happen to 


you just to warn you 

we started looking at all sorts of other kinds of 

molecules that became very interesting to me 

i especially love thinking about vitamins and drugs 

because i do have that interest in medicine and human health 

these are actually all examples that well talk about in 

freshman chemistry at some point as an example of a 

connection between a chemical principle we learn and what we 

can know about how it functions 

but what happened here was i thought oh my gosh now i 

could actually using my chemical knowledge think about 

synthesizing these molecules or maybe coming up with new 

ways to synthesize them better or synthesize 

different molecules 

and the real clincher was when i started doing some 

undergraduate research 

any potential urops out there  anyone planning to do 

a research at some point 

excellent 

okay 

so just to be warned you might fall in love with the 

subject you do your urop in 

this is one of our summer students from this past 

summer who is also premed 

shes continuing to be premed which is fantastic 

that didnt happen to me  once i got into the lab 

i didnt want to leave 

so i thought you know what i think ill change the medical 

school plans and now im going to go all the way  chemistry 

major chemistry grad school and the reason i was able to do 

that and keep with what my original intentions were was to 

have a career that was the fulfilling in terms of helping 


people and being engaged in science is all of a sudden i 

realized as chemists we can think about better ways to 

build molecules that are important for making 

medications 

another thing we can do is we can use our chemistry to 

understand biological systems so we can help illucinate 

pathways maybe that are implicated in disease 

so the combination of these two things had made my decision 

and i ended up coming here for graduate school actually and 


working in professor imperialis lab doing 

bioorganic chemistry which means that i synthesize 

molecules which i loved and used them to study 

biological systems 

so really im pretty happy with what ive gotten to do 

and i just want to say were not trying to convert 

all of them you premed people by any means 

my roommate for many years was going to medical school as i 

was going to graduate school and we found we had so many
