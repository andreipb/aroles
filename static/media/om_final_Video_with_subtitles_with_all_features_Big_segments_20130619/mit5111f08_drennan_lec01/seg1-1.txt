at ocwmitedu 

welcome to  and today what were going to 

do is introduce you to the course and the people 

teaching the course 

and were also going to let you know that you were going to be 

part of the great web exercise that is ocw opencourseware 

so this course is being videotaped this year and 

this is the announcement that i have to make 

so the videotape is in the back and if you want to come 

up front and participate in the class you know that youll be 

videotaped  if you want to hide your face or whatever you 

can do that but please pay attention to the 

lectures anyway 

so this course will be available on the ocw site 

in the future im not sure exactly what that 

date is going to be 

so today were going to introduce the chemistry topics 


which we will cover in  and give you general 

information practical information about the course 

number of points you need when the exams are that kind of 

thing policies and introduce you to the teaching staff 

i am again professor cathy drennen and im one of the 

lecturers in this course 

so because this is mit were going to start to quiz 


ok not a quiz for points or anything dont freak out 

but i do want you to tell me who these people are 

so what about this person 

thats me  this is my college yearbook photo 

ok what about this person over here 

you 

its not me again 

not elizabeth taylor 

it is lisa kudrow known as phoebe on friends so we 

both went to college at the same time we went to 

the same college 

does anybody know what college that was 

vassar 

vassar college very good 

and we graduated the same year  now no one has to say what 

year that was even if you know but we did 

graduate the same year 

all right 

so given what you know about us what do you think lisa 

went to college to study 

computer 

computers 

no 

theatre 

theatre 

surprisingly no 

nuclear engineering 

nuclear engineering at vassar no for a 

variety of reasons 

any other guesses 

english 

english no 

biology  i heard it 

biology 

what do you think i went to college to study 

theatre 

theatre correct 

andor i hadnt made up my mind exactly  

biopsychology or drama 

so biopsychology was what they called sort of brain and 

cognitive sciences in those days 

so those were the two things i was thinking about 

what do you think lisa ended up majoring in college 


biopsychology 

not biopsychology 

biology 

biology yes 

what do you think i majored in college 

this should be a bit easier 

chemistry 

chemistry and of course our professions 

actress and chemistry professor 

so let me ask what happened here 

my understanding about lisa kudrow is that she came 

from a hollywood family 

she went to college and said heres my opportunity to study 


the thing that i find most interesting and that was 

biology and then she went back and participated in the family 

business which was of course the acting profession 

for me what happened 

well i have to say i did not like chemistry in high school 

so i did not think about going to college to study chemistry 

so why did i not like chemistry in high school 

i think it was because of images such as this one 

you spend a lot of time talking about the transition between 

alchemy and modern chemistry 

i wasnt very interested in that kind of thing and theres 

nothing in these photographs that really appealed 

to me personally 

i mean avogadro  im fond of his number and he is in 

fact an interesting if not frightening looking man  this 

just didnt connect with me 

but then i got to college and they said well if youre 

thinking about anything bio  biopsychology biology  you 


have to take chemistry and i said to my advisor no no 

i have taken chemistry in high school and i can assure you 

that chemistry has no relevance whatsoever to the life 

sciences and they said well im sorry you feel that 

way its incorrect and you have to take it anyway 

so i like some of you in this room took freshman chemistry 

because we had to not because we wanted to 

and i like hopefully some of you in this room discovered 


that chemistry was actually a lot of fun and that the 

chemistry i got in college was pretty much nothing like the 

chemistry i had seen in high school 

so let me introduce you to some of the topics we are 

going to be covering in chemistry this semester 

so theres more detail on your syllabus  a detail of what 

well cover every day but these are the kind of basic 


things that were covering and you dont need to write this 

down youll become familiar with it as 

the semester goes on 

we start out with some really basic principles 

so up here atomic theory periodic table bonding 

structures and molecules 

and there will be a little bit of history in there but this 

is mostly modern chemistry and represents the basic properties 

of matter and its basic properties of all matter 

including living matter which was what really interested me 

that connection between chemistry and biology 

so then we go to thermodynamics and chemical 

equilibrium and this is really about chemical reactions  

weather a reaction will go will it be spontaneous if 

there an equilibrium what direction will the 

reaction be shifted in 

and then of course not just whether the reaction will 

occur but how fast it occurs is really important 

so thats kinetics  how fast a reaction will go and from 

the perspective of someone whos a biochemist im 

interested in kinetics and enzyme kinetics and thinking 

about molecules that catalyze reactions in the body 

and then theres acid base equilibrium and also oxidation 

reduction reactions and what is true is that most reactions 

that occur are either catalyzed by either some kind of acid 

base catalysis or involve some kind of oxidation reduction 

reaction and so this sort of represents a lot of the basic 

way reactions go  now whether thats a reaction in 

your body or a reaction in a test tube  it doesnt 

matter a lot of the same principles are involved 


and then we also cover transition metals which is 

something that you often dont see in high school 

and transition metals those all medals in the middle of 

your periodic table have some really unique properties which 

are exploited again in reactions that occur in your 

body and also are utilized in industry for example so well 

talk about some of those unique properties 

and if we put all of that together we get the real 


fundamentals that you need to go on and study  any 

kind of curriculum that involves chemistry 

so these are all the fundamentals that are involved 

in chemistry that relate to physical chemistry organic 

chemistry inorganic chemistry biological chemistry and are a 

solid foundation for studying any kind of life science 

so i congratulate you of being here in this class this is 

really good solid foundation for whatever you go on 

to do here at mit 

so normally at this point we do actually start class with a 

little bit of history from alchemy to modern chemistry 

but i decided to skip that this year 

if you are interested in that its never required on any
