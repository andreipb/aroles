test it never has been but if youre interested in that there 

is an ocw lecture which you can listen to thats an 

excellent lecture by professor sylvia ceyer on that 

but today instead i thought i would give you some examples of 

modern chemistry  why people now need to know chemistry 

what theyre doing with chemistry what is chemistry 

research here at mit and how does it utilize these basic 

principles which well be talking about in the course 


so ill start with my colleague professor 

joanne stubbe 

she studies molecules in particular she studies 

biological molecules 

and so one of the things shes very interested in is how this 

anticancer drug gemcitabine works in the body 

so it inhibits an enzyme and shes interested in knowing 

how that really works 

so enzymes are made up of amino acids you have long 

chains of amino acids that form together into a protein 

molecules protein molecules in your body often act as enzymes 

catalyzing reactions 

so she is interested in how this molecule gemcitabine 

inhibits an enzyme 

so to do those studies she needs to know a lot of 

the stuff on this list 

of course she needs to know the basic principles but shes 

also talking about it an enzyme so she needs to know 

about enzyme catalysis 

she needs to know this enzyme works by both 

acid base chemistry and oxidation reduction 

it has two irons that are involved in doing the 

chemistry so it includes transition metals 

she thinks about how things bind how the natural reactants 


binds how the inhibitor binds and so she needs to know what 

happens to the chemical equilibrium she needs to know 

about the thermodynamics of those binding events and of 

course everything all the basic principles 

are required here 

so to do this biochemistry research she needs to know all 

of these things and she has really made tremendous progress 

in understanding how gemcitabine works and it is 

not so toxic so its a really good thing to have 


in chemotherapy 

so in addition to studying molecules chemists often want 

to make molecules such as tim jamison whos an 

organic chemist 

so you will hear probably hopefully in this presidential 

debate about the environment and about why saving the 

environment is important 

and one of the things you often hear about in this discussion 

is about our oceans and about rainforests and part of the 

reason why people want to protect those areas is because 

you find a lot of natural products in those regions 

so a natural product is something that is made by 

nature and often natural products whether it comes from 

a plant or a marine organism have some really good 

useful properties 

and so one particular compound has antitumor properties 

so again along this line of cancer research 

so tim jamisons lab figured out how to make this thing 

and often thats really important because you cant 

get enough of the organism that naturally makes it to be able 

to grind that organism up and have enough that you can 

actually use as a medicine 

so you have to make more of it because nature 


doesnt make enough 

so its very important to figure out how to do that 

so in doing that tim jamisons lab needs a 

lot of these things 

so he needs a lot of knowledge of bonding he wants to 

form bonds in making this 

he needs to know about the structures of the molecules 

because if the structure is wrong its not going to work 


and often if you want to make a lot of it you have to think 

about the thermodynamics of the system how fast the reactions 

will go and kinetics and then whether theyll go the 

thermodynamics and sometimes then you need to adjust the 

reactions maybe use a transition metal to 

make it go better 

so these are all the things that tim jamison needs to know 

to do organic chemistry 

so youll be learning in this class a great preparation 

for  which is organic chemistry 

in addition to studying molecules and making molecules 

some chemists want to detect molecules and a chemist who 

likes to detect molecules is tim swager 

so tim swagers lab has designed sensors that detect 

vapors and so they will detect tnt for example 

and so he has put this chemistry to use in this 

robotic arm and they call it fido because often dogs are 

the creatures that have to go out and detect these things 

and its not a great job if youre a dog to be sent out to 

see whether there was an explosive and discover yes 

there was a little bit too late 

so this is a much nicer way to detect chemicals with this 

robotic arm and heres a picture of it in use in iraq 


so in doing this if you go down to kind of a basic 

principles that tim needed to know about oxidation reduction 

was really key in developing this technology so 

well talk about that 

so my final example is from alan davidsons lab and alan 

is an inorganic chemist  he loved those transition metals 

and theyre unique properties and he designed this compound 


its called cardiolite and its used in heart imaging 

so many people have relatives they know of that have had to 

have their heart imaged  heart disease is a major 

problem in the united states and theres a good chance that 

they had cardiolite given to them to help in that 

imaging process 

so this again takes advantage of those great unique 

properties of transition metals which well talk 

about in this course 

so again all together this is the basis for modern 

chemistry and examples i just gave you are some of the 

things that modern chemists are working on  some of the 

issues that our country faces and our world faces and how 

chemistry is involved in that 

so not only will you have the fundamental knowledge to go on 


and take more courses in chemistry you will also have 

the fundamental knowledge to go on and do undergraduate 

research here and here are some of the  undergraduate 

researchers that have come through my lab in 

particular from this class 

so its a really nice solid foundation 

so i want to encourage you to set some of your likes and 

dislikes from high school aside when you come to mit because 

at mit you often see disciplines taught and 

emphasize a very different fashion than what 

youve seen before 

and you may discover that the thing you came here to study is 

not the thing that you really want to study after all 

one other thing that ill say to you is that i said these 

words at one point its true i said when i was in high 

school i said i hate chemistry and now i do 

chemistry every day and will for the rest my life 

i love chemistry now 

be very careful what you say 

have any of you made that statement about 

hating a subject 

tell me later what it is youre going to be doing 

for the rest of your life 

so at mit things are very different and keep an open 

mind explore new areas  take advantage of being at this 

amazing place for science and technology and you may surprise 

yourself in what you really enjoy learning about 


so thats a little bit about the chemistry that were going 

to cover in this class and now im going to talk a little 

bit about some of the policies and procedures 

but first i need to introduce my coinstructor for this 

class and let me just put up her picture youll 

see her in a minute 

so dr beth vogel taylor 

so all chemistry courses are team taught so you have a 

different lecturer for the first half than the second 

half and dr taylor will be doing most of the first half 

lectures and ill be doing most of the second 

half lectures 

so dr taylor will take you from atomic theory through 

thermodynamics and ill start up with chemical equilibrium 

talk to about kinetics acid base oxidation reduction 

and transition metals 

so you will have both of us as lecturers in this class 

now in the past sometimes students have found this whole 

thing a little frustrating that they just get used to one 

lecture style and then all of a sudden theres another 

lecture style and that can be true 

i mean sometimes the styles of the two professors couldnt
