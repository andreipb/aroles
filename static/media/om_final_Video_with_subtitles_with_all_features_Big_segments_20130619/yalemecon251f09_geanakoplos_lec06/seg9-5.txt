and thank god for that because it couldnt have helped 

everybody if they did use it 

so thats the main lesson of laissezfaire 

so let me just put this in perspective a little bit 

in the old russian economy of the s and s there was no 

profit system so the central planner had to 

figure out should a new invention be used 

or not 

so every time theres a new invention a committee had to get 

together of central planners and decide whether to use it or 


not 

and theres a famous guy named kantorovich who was in charge of 

a lot of that 

he won the nobel prize in economics 

he shared it with a yale economist named koopmans and so 

kantorovich told this very amusing story 

he said that there were two central planning bureaus 

one was in charge of allocations and one was in 

charge of prices 

one had to set the prices 

the other had to set the allocations 

and of course the whole message here is that you have to combine 


these 

you dont know whether its worthwhile to change the 

allocation until you know whether the new technologys 

going to make a profit or not and here they had the two 

things separated 

they were telling people what to do before knowing whether 

they made a profit or not because they didnt have prices 

because there werent free markets 

so the bottom line of the fisher story is that you take 

this complicated financial economy 

you reduce it to something very simple that you learned how to 


do in your freshman year or your sophomore year 

solve that and you go back to this and you can understand a 

lot about this economy 

thats something that most people didnt realize at the 

time and still dont realize now 

so you ask a typical person if theres inflation 

that means the dividends next year is going to be higher 

is that going to raise the value of the stock today 

just like he said yes of course because it 


makes the price of the dividends higher tomorrow 

fisher would say no it doesnt change anything real 

in the economy 

if theres more inflation there will be a higher nominal 

interest rate so discounted by the higher 

interest rate payoffs of the stock will give you the same 

stock price as before 

so were going to do a thousand examples of this 

but are there any questions about this 

yes 

can you just review your arguments at  


end 

im just having a very hard time reading 

yeah sorry  

i dont know if this is in the way by the way 

so this is the argument we gave a few classes ago 

i forgot when 

we said how do you know that a final allocation that emerges as 

a competitive equilibrium is pareto efficient 

and the argument was if you can do better 

that means make everybody better off 


then each person if you look at the value of 

what theyre getting under the new regime it must be more than 

the value of their endowments otherwise they would have chosen 

the new regime and nobody chose it 

that means everybody would have had to pay more for this new 

regime allocation than the value of their endowments 

so this is more than that for person a 

and person bs consumption is more than the value of this 

endowments his extended endowments in the 

fisher thing under this new regime 

than the value of his endowments 

youre following that 

yeah  

then the next step was to add all this  

now notice however the new technology affects the world 

obviously people can only eat whats being produced 

everything thats being produced is part of somebodys 

endowment 

so if the new technology if mr a invents the new 

technology he gives up some of his good at 

time  to get more of the good at time  

so his endowment has changedbut hes got a new 

endowment but its still his endowment 

so whatever the new allocation is it has to add up to the new 

endowment 

now i havent even bothered to write down the new endowment 

but i know the value of that new endowment 

whatever it is its going to be less than the 

value of the old endowment because the new technology 

loses money 

so the contradiction is the value of the new endowment after 

the technology is used at the old equilibrium prices 


is lower than the value of the old endowment at the old 

equilibrium prices 

but that since its true for every person in the aggregate 

thats less than the value of this new regime consumption 

and thats a contradiction because the new regime 

consumption thats all this stuff 

has to equal exactly the total endowments in the economy to 

begin with and thats the contradiction 

so you cant make everybody better off 

that simple argument which as i said 


my advisor ken arrow another guy at yale named 

gerard debreu both of them were working at 

the cowles foundation which is part of yale 

that proof that they gave is the simplest and most important 

argument in all of economics 

so we get as a conclusion that putting it another way 

that owners of firms should maximize the value of their 

firms the stock market value of their 

firms and thank god they do because 

if they find some new way of producing thats going to lose 

money its going to make the stock market value go down 

remember the stock market value is just the same calculation 

the value of all the output theyre producing 

if they find some way of losing money and they try to use it 

itll make their stock market value go down 

thats why theyre not going to do it and thank god for that 

because itd be a bad thing for society if they did do it 

yes 

well it seems to me this proof  

logically flawed because youre assuming that after the 

inception of a technology the prices are left unchanged 

but that might not be true 

shouldnt you have some argument for the prices not 

changing after the inception of the technology 


this is a very bold  

telling me that its a flawed proof 

i want to commend you for your courage 

as it happens however youve asked the same 

question that somebody asked a class or twowhich is a very 

good question 

so the answer is no i shouldnt have changed the 

prices and thats exactly the point of the proof 

so yes its true that after the new technology is introduced 

the prices changes everything changes 

but we dont have to worry about all that complication 

after all the changes theres going to be some final 

allocation of goods that supposedly makes everybody 

better off 

so i can ask the hypothetical question 

would this new allocation to a at the old prices be something 

he could have afforded and the answer must be no 

all right ive got  

well let me just  

you see the answer to your question but im going to say 

it out because its a very important question 

the proof is clever precisely because of what youre asking 

you have to do something that you wouldnt have thought of 

you have this new economy and new allocation 

and new prices but the proof says lets do the 

hypothetical thing of looking at the new allocation at the old 

prices 

at the old prices a couldnt have afforded this new 

allocation because if he could have he would have bought it 

because it makes him better off 

so at the old prices a couldnt have afforded this new regime
