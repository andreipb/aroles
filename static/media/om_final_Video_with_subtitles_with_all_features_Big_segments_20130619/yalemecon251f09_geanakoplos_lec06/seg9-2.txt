making deductions for no arbitrage 

so most of finance is actually being more and more clever about 

how to do no arbitrage 

over half of this course is going to be lets look at 

situations where at first glance there doesnt seem to be any 

arbitrage 

then you realize if youre clever enough youll recognize 

an arbitrage and be able to figure out all the prices 

without having to know all the utilities and everything else 

so one of the main goals of finance is to explain asset 


prices 

you can see how no arbitrage is going to help do that 

because if you knew what some of the asset prices were you 

could deduce what the rest might be 

so thats the first thing fisher did and hes used this 

fact in connecting these two economies 

so thats the first thing 

now that principle can be used over and over again 


another application of it lets suppose that we 

introduced a nominal bond with payoff  dollar in period  

and suppose as before that q  

q   as weve already supposed 

so then by definition the price of this bond is equal to  over 

 i where i is the nominal interest rate 

why is that 

because youre going to get a dollar next year 

if the price is less than a dollar this year youre turning 

something less than a dollar into something equal to a 

dollar 

youre multiplying todays price by  i to get tomorrows 

price so the rate of return is  i 

taking whatever you put in today and getting  i tomorrow 

so what is  i 

so by no arbitrage we can figure out what  i must be 

so  dollar today can go into  units of stock alpha 

which goes into  units of x as dividends 

which equals  dollars 

so you take  dollar today by buying stock alpha you can get  

units of it since its price is a third 

and since stock alpha pays one unit of output next period you 

know that  dollar today gives you  units of stock alpha 

which gives you  units of good  as the output and at price  

dollar tomorrow youve anticipated thats  dollars 

so by buying stock alpha you can put in a dollar and get out 

 dollars 

so it means that  i   which means the interest rate 


is  percent 

so thats a second thing you can deduce from that 

so notice that by looking at part of the equilibrium here we 

can figure out a lot of the rest of the equilibrium 

so whats another application 

well fisher said define the real interest rate as number of 

goods today goes into number of good tomorrow 

so this will be  r equals that 

the number of goods today and how many good tomorrow do you 


get 

so how can you do that 

well  good today  unit of x is  

dollar today right 

if you had one apple today you could sell it for q 

times  apple which is q times  

which is  times  which is  dollar today 

which you can get  units  shares  units of stock 

alpha which gives you  units of x 

so  unit of x today turns into  units of 


x so therefore  r   implies r 

  percent 

so thats the real rate of interest 

so one of the tricks in going from here to here was to say 

that fisher realized that people are going to look through all 

the gibberish of money and theyre going to think about 

what apples are they giving up today and what apples are they 

getting tomorrow 

theyre not going to be confused by all the holding of 

assets in between 

all right so lets just make it a little bit more 

complicated 

suppose we started with q   

q   

now i told you that equilibriumfisher says theres 

always a normalization 

walras originally had the normalization in one period 

theres a one period model in general equilibrium 

in multiperiod models theres a normalization every period 

every period theres a choice of whether youre dealing with 

dollars or francs or centimes 

or how many and so theres a free 

normalization 

so lets take q   and q   

well what does that mean 

that means that inflation  lets call it growth of money 

gi ive already used for the nominal interest rate 

so  g is going to be  over  or just  

so inflation   percent 

so whats pialpha going to be 

ive done my work 

now the rest im going to just ask you for the rest of the 

numbers 

whats pialpha 

so if i resolved equilibrium taking q   and 

q   all thats kind of money stuff so its not 


going to change what happens over there 

youre going to get the same equilibrium over there and 

youre going to go back to over here 

so whats pialpha going to be 

ahha 

suppose we knew we were in the same real economy 

theres nothing changed about utilities endowments of goods 

productivity of the stocks 

all we know is that inflations going to be higher now 

so what do you think would happen in the new equilibrium 

whats going to happen to the price of stocks today 

yes 

is it just   

price of stock  

what was it before 

b 

so what was it  

 third  

yeah  third so its still   

this is a big mystery in finance a big question in 

finance 

so you see why its puzzling 

you didnt get the answer right off although she did 

so you just have to think about it a second 

if you really thought that people when they were buying and 

selling only bought a stock because they said to themselves 

how many apples am i going to get out of this stock 

i dont care about dollars and centimes and francs 

im not going to eat that 

im going to eat the apples and maybe i get the apples and 

sell them and eat pears instead but i care about the goods im 

going to get 

so i looked through all the veil 

i should recognize that the stock although its now going 

to pay twice as many dollars as it did before 

so its going to pay  dollars 

thats how someone guessed  

someone said  

so how did he get  

i didnt even realize how he came up with the number  

he came up with the number  because he said 


well the stock is paying  apple tomorrow 

the price of apples is now  so its paying  dollars 

tomorrow so maybe its price today should be  

but no that isnt how much the stock is worth 

the stock is worth solving for this general equilibrium supply 

and demand 

we already calculated before that the stock was a third 

so the price of the stock is going to stay a third because 

the apples it pays tomorrow hasnt changed 

its still the same one apple 

now how did we know the stock was priced at a third before 

what was the stock in general 

whats the price of the stock 

the price of stock remember is how did we get it 


by going from here to here 

we said its going to equal the price of the stock divided by 

p 

now the stock is only paying a certain number of goods 

the price of the stock today is going to equal the present value 

 over  r times its dividend 

ill write it this way 

the price of the stock is p times this 

lets just write this 

what would fisher say 

how did we get the price of the stock from going from here to 


here 

we got the price of the stock by saying the stock pays off one 

good tomorrow but one good tomorrow is only 

worth a third of one good today so therefore the value of the 

stock is only equal to a third times    third 

so assuming p   thats what fisher would say 

assuming p is  you figure out how many units of 

todays good is it worth 

now if p isnt  then what do you do 

suppose p were  and p wereor 

p is  lets say and p is 

 then what would you do 

youd have to say p times pialpha  

dalpha 

so if you multiplied all the prices byam i putting the 

p down at the bottom or the top 

if you multiply out all the prices by  just leave it like 

this 

well say if pialpha  p times 

dalpha 

if you measure it in terms of goods thats how you do it 

so if you take this this is also equal to  over 

p divided by p if p 

is  assuming p is  

times dalpha which is  over  r times
