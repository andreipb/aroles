so the weight on this thing is  over  delta times this 

divided by p 

so if p is  then this is just equal to  over  

delta times ea  over p times 

ea 

so clearly the demand goes down as p goes 

as pthis is p 

so p   so if i divide by 

p p over 

p goes away 

then i have p over p 

and if p is  thats just  over 

p 

so obviously as p goes up your demand goes down 

thats just what youd expect 

so p goes down the demand goes up 

or p goes up the demand goes down 

so anyway if you add up cobbdouglas people it always is 

like that 

the demand for any good goes up as the price goes down 

if its own price goes down 

so if you change delta if you make delta smaller 

thats going to raise demand for a at the old 

prices 

why 

at old equilibrium prices the same trick as before 

at old equilibrium prices whats going to happen 

delta goes down like we just said implies xa 

goes up 

so the guys demanding more now but if hes demanding more 

at the old equilibrium prices so at the old equilibrium 

prices hes demanding more so the only way to clear the market 


is to raise p 

implies p must go up to clear the market 

so this is a formal proof of what he just said 

so the common sense maybe is enough for you 

if you care less about the future to get anybody to save 

youre going to have to raise the interest rate 

to say it formally if we solve for equilibrium with a lower 

delta at the old equilibrium prices 

this guy at the old prices a would now shift and try to 

demand more of good  

but if he demanded more of good  that would mean too much 

demand for good  and the only way to clear the 


price of good  is to raise the price p 

but if you raise p holding p fixed 

thats just p over p 

so the interest rate so the interest rate has to go 

up 

so thats your argument made formal 

so thats his impatience theory 

thats the main determinant of interest according to fisher 


whats the second one 

he says suppose people are more optimistic about 

ei 

everybody thinks the worlds going to be much better next 

year 

were going to have more endowments 

what do you think is going to happen to the interest rate 

the real interest rate somebody else 

itll decrease  

itll what  

decrease  

decrease why  

because youre expecting things to be  

 

signifies people will save less 

to save less or to save  


so lets think of good x 

if people thought they were going to be richer at the old 

prices what would they do today for x demand more or 

less today 

the rate would go up  

yeah the right answer is  

he said down but lets just figure out why 

they demand more b 

so the reason i gave the formal argument  

because you can get confused here 

so lets just do the intuitive one 

so you had the idea back there of the intuitive one 

you just got it backward but you were on the right 

track 

the point is theres going to be so much stuff around for 

people to eat tomorrow youve got to get them to want 

to eat all that extra stuff tomorrow 

so you have to give them an incentive to want to eat all 

that extra stuff tomorrow so you have to raise the 

interest rate not lower it 

so you had the right idea the wrong conclusion 

now how can you actually give a formal proof of that so you 

know youre not confused 

again like his question at the old prices whats going 

to happen to the demand for x 

at the old prices since youre going to be so 

rich in the future you think youre just 

incredibly rich now so of course youre going to 

consume more today 

so theres going to be more demand today and the endowment 

today hasnt changed 

so theres going to be more demand today with the same 

endowment today so therefore in order to clear 

the market today youre going to have to raise p 

relative to p so the interest rates got to go up 


so is that clear 

its a little surprising so let me say that again 

if you increase the endowments tomorrow the supply today of 

goods hasnt changed but people are richer tomorrow 

so clearly theyre going to consume this fraction of their 

wealth 

their wealth is up 

you tell anybody youre going to be rich 

next year 

youre going to be worth a fortune 

the normal person cobbdouglas person 

is going to consume more stuff today anticipating that hes 

going to be so rich tomorrow 

hes going to borrow against tomorrows wealth 

and so therefore in order to clear todays 

market where the supply hasnt changed 

with all these people trying eat more today you have to raise 

todays price relative to tomorrow 

thats raise the real interest rate 

so whats a third example 

this is fishers most famous one 

suppose you transfer money transfer wealth 

from poor to rich 

what would happen 

we have to make an extra assumption here 

fisher felt that the people who were rich were rich because they 

were patient 

they could charge interest and get lots of money 

so if you change wealth you take away some money from the 


poor 

thats whats happened in the american economy over the last 

 or  years 

the rich have gotten richer and the poor are pretty much back 

where they were before 

so suppose the rich get rich at the expense of the poor 

whats that going to do to the real rate of interest 

illhang on a second 

yep 

that would make it  

thats going to lower  

why is that 

b 

so theres an intuitive way of saying it  


is his which is that the rich because theyre patient 

are probably the lenders 

now theyre even more willing to lend and so the interest rate 

has to go down to get these other people to borrow 

a formal way of saying it is that if you transfer money from 

the rich poor 

to the poor rich 

that means the poor guys the rich guys always consume a 

higher proportion in the future because theyre more patient 

so a more patient guy will consume more in the future 

so if you take away wealth from an impatient guy and give it to 

a patient guy youre going to increase the 

the economys going to be more in the hands of the patient 

people and so the patient peoplethe 


mix is going to change 

people on average are more patient than they were before so 

on average in the economy theyre going to consume less 

than they were of todays good and so the shift is going to be 

in this direction right 

because youve made people a lot of them impatient 

a lot of patient youve increased the patient 

ones and decreased the impatient ones 

so in balance youre going to decrease demand today because it 


was the impatient ones who wanted to eat today and the 

other guys were willing to wait 

now the guys who arent willing to wait these guys dont have 

any money 

theyre the ones doing all the consuming today and now they 

cant afford to do much consuming so youre going to 

reduce consumption today 

so to get the market to clear again you have to lower the 

interest rate this time 

so those are three famous conclusions of fisher 

more impatient people higher interest rate 

more optimistic about the future higher interest rate 

transfers from the poor to the rich lower interest rate 

so what happens to the stock market in this case 

suppose people are more impatient 

does the stock market go up or down
