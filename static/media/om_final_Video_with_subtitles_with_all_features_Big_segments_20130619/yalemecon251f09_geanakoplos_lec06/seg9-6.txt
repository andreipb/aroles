allocation 

similarly b at the old prices 

couldnt afford this new regime allocation 

so at the old prices everybody would have to be spending more 

on the new regime allocation than the value of their 

endowment 

that means at the old prices the total in the whole 

society by adding it upof the 

expenditures on the new regime consumptions must be bigger than 

the total value of the old endowments 

now that was the contradiction why at the old endowments 

without production you couldnt make everybody better off 

wed already have a contradiction 

now we add one more step 

weve got this new technology that changed the old endowments 

it changed the old endowments but however it changed it we 

dont have to keep track of how it did it 

it makes the value of the total endowments even less than it was 


before so we actually get a worse contradiction than before 

so it was a good question so i thank you for the 

question 

any other questions 

yes 

can you raise the board a little  

yes i can raise which  

not this one 

yes that one  

yeah  

well sorry 

oh  

so the bottom line here is thatlet me  


summarize 

weve spent four classes on reviewing standard intermediate 

micro and macro 

people never talk about that stuff when they do 

financialfinance courses in typical courses 

however irving fisher the inventor of half of 

finance thats how he began 

and its going to turn out now especially in light of this 

last crisis that the best way to understand 

whats going on is to go back to the original underlying economy 

so fisher said you can always takewe havent introduced 


risk by the way 

when that happens things are going to get more complicated 

fisher couldnt deal with risk 

so without risk where everybodys anticipating 

the dividends in the future that means that you can always 

reduce a financial economy up there to a general equilibrium 

which youve been taught before you got to this course 

most of you how to solve 

and now that solution to that problem with marginal utility 

and pareto efficiency that tells us an enormous amount about how 

the stock market and everything works 

it tells us that the value of every stock is just the 

discounted real dividends discounted at the real rate of 

interest or the discounted nominal 

payoffs cash flows discounted at the nominal rate 

of interest 

and it tells us that the real rate of interest is the nominal 

rate divided by the rate of inflation 


and it tells us that its a good thing all these owners of 

companies are maximizing profits or share value 

which is the same thing and thats helping society 

so thats the lesson 

a lot of that stuff is going to change a little bit 

but thats the basic idea 

so finally lets get to the point 

for  years the public was confused about interest 

they saidaristotle one of the greatest geniuses of 

all times he thought interest was an unnatural act 

it was horrible even though of course lots of people in 

greece were charging interest 

delos the delphic oracle was charging interest 

would lend money at interest and aristotle and everybody was 

talking about the delphic oracle all the time 

they werent even paying attention 

the delphic oracle was charging interest and they were saying 

its totally unnatural 

so three religions all thought interest was a terrible thing 

they all thought the just price wasthe nominal rate of 

interest should be  but what fisher says is the 

nominal rate of interest is irrelevant 

nobody cares about the nominal rate of interest 

they look at apples today and apples next year 

the money and stuff just gets in the way 

its the real rate of interest that you care about 

and the real rate of interest doesnt have to be positive 

it could be negative like it is today 

the real rate of interest what are the determinants 

usually of the real rate of interest if the federal reserve 


isnt mucking around with things 

the real rate of interest is obtained by solving for 

p and p in this general equilibrium 

model 

so what would change the real rate of interest 

all you have are the utilities and the endowments 

so heres the economy 

what would change the real rate of interest 

so the first thing fisher says is impatience 

so in fact one of his most famous articles is called an 

impatience theory of interest so lets call it that 


impatience theory of interest 

so fisher said that in his view people are impatient 

why 

that means an apple today they thought was more valuable that 

an apple next year 

why 

because of the poor imagination it was easy to 

think about eating the apple today 

you can just hold it in your hand and its so close 

but to think about eating it in a year requires some 

imagination 

they had poor imagination and secondly 


the second main reason is mortality 

they might die between today and next year 

so those are the two main reasons 

he gives a bunch of others which im going to mention 

shortly but these are the two most 

interesting ones poverty of imagination and the 

fact that you just might die in between 

so what does it mean 

an apple next year is not a sure thing 

there is the impatience theory of interest 

so he said thats why it makes sense to have this guy a as 

impatient because he values the apple today more than a value 

tomorrow 

hes got this discount rate a half here 

bs not impatient because the discount factor is one 

so he put a discount factoractually fisher didnt 

quite have a discount factor he had a more general thing 

so samuelson was the one who introduced the discount factor 

it doesnt matter but anyway so a discount factor 

to capture fishers idea that the good next year 

the same apple next year is not worth as much to a as an apple 

this year 

so suppose i change a half to a third 


what will happen to the real rate of interest 

so that makes people more impatient 

why does it make them more impatient because now they care 

even less about the good next year 

so when did this happen 

in the reagan years the now generation 

everybody talked about the now generation 

people are getting more impatient 

so what happens to the real rate of interest when people get 

more impatient 

does it go up or down 

it goes up  

so why does it go  

thats correct 

because there needs to be more of an  

to save 

right but now fisher would say that  


little bit more he would say it a little more 

formally but thats exactly right 

in order to get anybody to save because they want the 

stuff now youre going to have to give them a higher real rate 

of interest 

thats exactly right 

so how could you say it in this economy 

next slower remember in this economy 

this cobbdouglas economy you could prove it formally 

you know that if p lets say   and were 

solving for p and heres the supply 

this is x and heres demand 

so remember xa is going to be something like 

p ea p ea 

times  over  delta where delta 

whats called delta the discount 

lets call this delta so the discount 

so to get these to add up to  i take  delta
