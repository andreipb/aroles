VL-yalgea06 0.97 5.41 s0001 ALRIGHT SO WE SPENT A LONG TIME REVIEWING GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 5.42 13.48 s0001 AND WE'VE NOW SWITCH TO FINANCE A MEAL OR HOPEFULLY GOING TO SAY THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF FINANCE EMERGE VERY QUICKLY FROM THE PRINCIPLES 
VL-yalgea06 13.49 15.44 s0001 OF GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM SO THAT 
VL-yalgea06 15.45 17.91 s0001 ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS IT WAS A LONG INTERLUDE 
VL-yalgea06 17.91 21.10 s0001 WE ACTUALLY LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE FINANCIAL ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 21.10 24.38 s0001 SO WE I'M GOING TO CONTINUE WITH THE EXAMPLE THAT WE 
VL-yalgea06 24.38 27.91 s0001 STARTED WITH LAST TIME SO WE HAVE A FINANCIAL ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 27.91 32.39 s0001 SO THE FINANCIAL ECONOMY WHAT WHAT IS A FINANCIAL ECONOMY UNDER STOP BOARD 
VL-yalgea06 32.40 34.72 s0001 THE FINANCIAL ECONOMIES TO FIND 
VL-yalgea06 34.72 35.86 s0001 BY 
VL-yalgea06 35.86 38.05 s0001 LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THE ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 38.07 43.86 s0001 AND THEIR UTILITIES SO THAT'S NO HERE WE HAVE FOR SIMPLICITY TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE A AND B. 
VL-yalgea06 43.86 48.80 s0001 WITH UTILITIES GIVEN BY THE LOG X. ONE PLUS ONE OF LIKE TO IT CETERA 
VL-yalgea06 48.81 58.63 s0001 IT'S ALSO PEOPLE KNOW TODAY WHAT THEIR ENDOWMENTS ARE AND THEY HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE TOMORROW SO HERE YOU KNOW THEIR LABOUR POWER TO NAME AGAIN AND 
VL-yalgea06 58.64 60.58 s0001 BE ABLE TO WORK AGAIN NEXT YEAR 
VL-yalgea06 60.58 62.03 s0001 SO THE 
VL-yalgea06 62.04 67.97 s0001 THE LABOUR IS A ENDOWMENTS ARE GIVEN A BY ONE ONE FOR A A ONE ZERO FOR BE 
VL-yalgea06 67.97 71.62 s0001 AND THEN THEY ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO STOCKS IN THE ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 71.63 76.27 s0001 AND THEY HAVE TO ANTICIPATE WHAT THE DIVIDENDS ARE GOING TO BE IN THIS FISHER SAID THE MAIN 
VL-yalgea06 76.27 81.93 s0001 THE VALUE OF ASSETS IS THAT THEY THEY GIVE YOU SOMETHING THEY PRODUCE SOMETHING IN THIS CASE ARE GOING TO BE DIVIDENDS 
VL-yalgea06 81.94 86.48 s0001 AND BABIES PRODUCING GIVEN AND OF TWO OUT WAS PRODUCING DIVIDEND OF ONE NEXT PERIOD 
VL-yalgea06 86.48 91.53 s0001 AND THEN THEY FAIL OWNERSHIP OF A SHARE SO THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 91.54 93.13 s0001 AND WE WANTED TO FIND 
VL-yalgea06 93.14 94.85 s0001 FROM THAT EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 94.86 96.05 s0001 WHICH INVOLVES 
VL-yalgea06 96.06 97.35 s0001 COOL ONE OF THE 
VL-yalgea06 97.36 103.19 s0001 CONTEMPORANEOUS PRICES GOING TO BE THAT'S Q. FOR CONTEMPORANEOUS WHAT ARE THE PRICES OF THE STOCKS GOING TO BE 
VL-yalgea06 103.20 105.18 s0001 AND WHAT WAS GOING TO HOLD WHICH 
VL-yalgea06 105.19 106.88 s0001 PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS 
VL-yalgea06 106.88 109.83 s0001 OF STOCKS AND WHO'S GOT WAS GOING TO CONSUME WHAT 
VL-yalgea06 109.84 113.45 s0001 AND SO FISHER SAID THAT'S A VERY COMPLICATED PROBLEM 
VL-yalgea06 113.46 120.24 s0001 YOU CAN SIMPLIFY IT BY LOOKING AT A GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEM WHICH IS MUCH SHORTER DRIVE 
VL-yalgea06 120.25 124.17 s0001 AND SO THE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE A MUCH SIMPLER ONE 
VL-yalgea06 124.18 128.63 s0001 IT'S GOING TO CONSISTS OF U. A. AND WE'LL BE THE SAME AS BEFORE 
VL-yalgea06 128.63 130.47 s0001 AND A HAT 
VL-yalgea06 130.47 133.75 s0001 A ONE THE ENDOWMENT SKI HATS 
VL-yalgea06 133.85 135.60 s0001 AID TO 
VL-yalgea06 135.62 139.99 s0001 AND HE HAD HE WON HE HATH BE TOO 
VL-yalgea06 140.08 143.72 s0001 OKAY SO WE LEFT OUT HALF THE VARIABLES UP THERE 
VL-yalgea06 143.72 146.38 s0001 AND WE DEFINE E. HATS 
VL-yalgea06 146.38 149.17 s0001 WE WANT EQUAL TO BE 
VL-yalgea06 149.19 151.44 s0001 ANYONE EQUAL TO ONE 
VL-yalgea06 151.46 157.39 s0001 AND SHE HAD BE ONE PEOPLE B. B. ONE EQUALS ONE 
VL-yalgea06 157.38 158.70 s0001 BUT A HAT 
VL-yalgea06 158.72 161.06 s0001 A TWO THIS IS THE FISHER INSIGHT 
VL-yalgea06 161.06 162.15 s0001 EQUALS 
VL-yalgea06 162.16 164.05 s0001 BE A TWO 
VL-yalgea06 164.06 166.44 s0001 PLUS WHAT A HOMES 
VL-yalgea06 166.45 169.79 s0001 OF THE PAYOFFS OF THE FUTURE THE RUINS 
VL-yalgea06 171.77 173.22 s0001 ANY 
VL-yalgea06 173.22 176.51 s0001 AL THOUGHT OF THE WEALTH OF BE 
VL-yalgea06 177.28 178.92 s0001 BETA TWO 
VL-yalgea06 178.93 182.33 s0001 OKAY SO SINCE A OWNS HALF OF THE ALPHA STOCK 
VL-yalgea06 182.34 183.38 s0001 BROUGHT SORRY 
VL-yalgea06 183.39 186.05 s0001 ALL OF THE OFFICE STOCK IN HALF OF THE BAY THE STOCK 
VL-yalgea06 186.07 187.68 s0001 ISN'T DOWN IS ONE 
VL-yalgea06 187.69 192.53 s0001 FOR WHAT HIS OR HIS ORIGINAL THING PLUS WITH THE STOCK IS GOING TO PRODUCE AN AFTER ALL HE'S THE OWNER 
VL-yalgea06 192.54 193.58 s0001 SO HE'S GOING TO GET 
VL-yalgea06 193.59 194.73 s0001 HALF 
VL-yalgea06 194.73 197.80 s0001 OF TWO ARE ALL OF ONE 
VL-yalgea06 198.48 201.73 s0001 PLUS A HALF OF TWO WHICH IS EQUAL TO THREE 
VL-yalgea06 201.73 202.80 s0001 AND 
VL-yalgea06 202.81 205.36 s0001 SO I TOOK MORE SPACE THAN I THOUGHT 
VL-yalgea06 205.37 207.36 s0001 AND SO SIMILARLY BE HAD 
VL-yalgea06 207.37 209.12 s0001 BE TOO 
VL-yalgea06 209.13 210.59 s0001 IS GOING TO BE ONE 
VL-yalgea06 210.60 212.38 s0001 PLUS A HALF OF TWO 
VL-yalgea06 212.39 213.67 s0001 WHICH EQUALS TWO 
VL-yalgea06 213.67 214.80 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 214.82 216.41 s0001 HERE ARE A 
VL-yalgea06 216.41 218.39 s0001 ENDOWMENTS ARE THIS 
VL-yalgea06 219.76 221.55 s0001 AND ALSO 
VL-yalgea06 221.56 223.81 s0001 OF COURSE THIS RIGHT HERE 
VL-yalgea06 223.82 226.85 s0001 HE HAD A TWO EQUALS THREE 
VL-yalgea06 227.00 228.74 s0001 SO LET'S 
VL-yalgea06 229.71 233.56 s0001 OKAY SO FISHER SAID WE START WITH A FINANCIAL EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 233.57 236.12 s0001 WE CAN SWITCH TO THE ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 236.12 242.62 s0001 AND SOLVE THIS PROBLEM HAVING SOLVE AT ONE GO BACK AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE THIS ONE IN YOUR MEMBER WHAT THE PRICES WERE 
VL-yalgea06 242.63 244.25 s0001 THEY TURN OUT TO BE 
VL-yalgea06 244.26 248.54 s0001 Q. ONE OF THEM AS A WAY TO UP THERE BUT THE PRICES WE HAD 
VL-yalgea06 248.54 250.08 s0001 WE SAW BOTH 
VL-yalgea06 250.08 256.12 s0001 WE SAID FIRST OF ALL FISH FRESNO THEORY FOR THE CONTEMPORANEOUS PRICES ALL RELATIVE PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 256.12 260.30 s0001 ALRIGHT THAT RELATIVE PRICES ALL WE CAN EVER FIGURE OUT 
VL-yalgea06 260.35 266.74 s0001 YOU KNOW SOMEONE MIGHT ALWAYS COME ALONG AND CHANGE DOLLARS TO SENSE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY IN FRANCE WHERE WERE ON VACATION 
VL-yalgea06 266.75 268.27 s0001 THEY SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED THAT 
VL-yalgea06 268.29 273.05 s0001 THE FRANK WAS GOING TO BE DIVIDED BY A YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT WAS A HUNDRED FRANCS WOULD NOW BE ONE FRANKEN 
VL-yalgea06 273.06 276.76 s0001 YOU MAY JUST ME REDEFINE THE CURRENCY SO THAT MIGHT ALWAYS HAPPEN SO 
VL-yalgea06 276.77 281.32 s0001 YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SERIOUS MONEY IN ONE THE GOVERNS GOING TO DO THAT TO FIGURE OUT THE NOMINAL PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 281.33 285.53 s0001 SO MAYBE A SO CONTEMPORANEOUS PRICES HE SAYS OR ONE 
VL-yalgea06 285.55 286.63 s0001 ONE 
VL-yalgea06 286.64 287.88 s0001 I BUT HAVING 
VL-yalgea06 287.89 290.89 s0001 REALISE THAT IF THERE ARE MANY GOODS A TIMELINE 
VL-yalgea06 290.91 294.27 s0001 HE COULD FIGURE OUT THE RELATIVE PRICES WERE FALLING ONE GOOD TIME ONE 
VL-yalgea06 294.27 297.33 s0001 WHO'S TO SAY WHETHER WE'RE MEASURING DOLLARS OR FRANCS OR SENSE 
VL-yalgea06 297.33 302.08 s0001 I WOULD JUST CALL IT ONE AND THE SAME THING'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT YEAR WHO KNOWS WITH ITS DOLLARS A SENSOR FRANCS 
VL-yalgea06 302.08 303.66 s0001 SO GOING TO CALL IT ONE AGAIN 
VL-yalgea06 303.68 306.17 s0001 BUT AFTER THAT HE HE FIGURED EVERYTHING OUT 
VL-yalgea06 306.18 308.37 s0001 THIS TURNED OUT TO BE A PRICE 
VL-yalgea06 308.37 312.01 s0001 OF THE THIRD THIS TURNED OUT TO BE A PRICE OF TWO THIRDS 
VL-yalgea06 312.02 314.52 s0001 AND WE FIGURED OUT ALL THE CONSUMPTION MEANS 
VL-yalgea06 314.54 317.04 s0001 OF WHICH I'VE FORGOTTEN OF COURSE 
VL-yalgea06 317.04 319.32 s0001 BUT ANYWAY THEY WERE 
VL-yalgea06 323.22 325.28 s0001 LITTLE THEY WERE 
VL-yalgea06 325.27 327.01 s0001 NOT THAT IT'S TOO IMPORTANT 
VL-yalgea06 327.02 328.16 s0001 UM 
VL-yalgea06 328.16 332.04 s0001 OH I FORGOT TO ANYWAY FIGUEROA CONSUMPTION I THINK THEY WERE 
VL-yalgea06 332.05 333.12 s0001 OF 
VL-yalgea06 333.13 334.93 s0001 ACTUALLY AS WE REMEMBER THEM 
VL-yalgea06 334.94 336.35 s0001 OWN 
VL-yalgea06 337.96 342.62 s0001 WELL IT SAID ON A WAY FIGURED OUT OF A CONSUMPTION HAS ANYONE REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE 
VL-yalgea06 342.85 344.59 s0001 AH 
VL-yalgea06 345.92 347.42 s0001 PART I WILL 
VL-yalgea06 347.43 348.82 s0001 LOOK THE MOTH 
VL-yalgea06 353.47 357.09 s0001 FOUR THIRDS TO TWO THIRDS TO OKAY SO THEY WERE 
VL-yalgea06 357.10 358.75 s0001 FOUR THIRDS 
VL-yalgea06 359.79 361.25 s0001 TWO 
VL-yalgea06 361.26 363.62 s0001 AND TWO THIRDS AND TO 
VL-yalgea06 363.74 366.24 s0001 AND TWO THIRDS INTO 
VL-yalgea06 367.79 375.54 s0001 OKAY SO HE FIGURED OUT AN EQUILIBRIUM AND HOW DID HE DO IT BECAUSE HE SOLVED OVER HERE FIRSTLY WHAT OF SALT INTO THIS EXACT PROBLEM BUT IT WAS ALL OVER HERE 
VL-yalgea06 375.55 378.28 s0001 AND WE WERE FOUND WITH P. ONE EQUAL TO ONE 
VL-yalgea06 378.28 380.32 s0001 P. TWO EQUALS A THIRD 
VL-yalgea06 380.32 384.76 s0001 AND SURE ENOUGH X. A. Y. EQUALS FOUR THIRDS TAXI 
VL-yalgea06 384.77 387.59 s0001 TWO EQUALS TWO X. BE ONE 
VL-yalgea06 387.60 389.62 s0001 EQUALS TWO THIRDS 
VL-yalgea06 389.62 390.95 s0001 AN X. P. TWO 
VL-yalgea06 390.96 392.00 s0001 EQUALS TWO 
VL-yalgea06 392.01 395.52 s0001 OKAY SO FISHER SAID START WITH THE FINANCIAL ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 395.52 404.16 s0001 FIGURE OUT WHAT THE REDUCE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM IS SULPHUR THIS EQUILIBRIUM AND GO BACK AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FINANCIAL EQUILIBRIUM SHOULD BE 
VL-yalgea06 404.49 410.26 s0001 RIGHT SO I WANNA NOW EXAMINE WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WE DID THAT THE END OF LAST LAST YEAR TO DO IT THE PROBLEMS THAT 
VL-yalgea06 410.26 413.66 s0001 OKAY AND YOU NOTICE THAT THE BREAK ONLY DIFFERENCE DOING THIS AND THAT 
VL-yalgea06 413.67 420.70 s0001 IS THE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM THROWS AWAY A LOT OF IRRELEVANT INFORMATION BECAUSE FISHER SAID PEOPLE ARE RATIONALLY LOOKS IN THE VEIL 
VL-yalgea06 420.71 422.33 s0001 OF ALL THE GIBBERISH OF THE 
VL-yalgea06 422.34 426.65 s0001 WHO OWNS THE COMPANY AND STUFF LIKE THAT THEY'RE JUST ANTICIPATING WHAT THE COMPANY'S GOING TO PRODUCE 
VL-yalgea06 426.65 429.08 s0001 THEY DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S 
VL-yalgea06 429.09 434.66 s0001 A MAN RUNNING THE COMPANY OR A WOMAN WANTING THE COMPANY OR WHETHER SHE'S GOT AN M. B. A. FROM HARVARD OR FROM YALE OR 
VL-yalgea06 434.67 435.98 s0001 NONE OF THAT'S IRRELEVANT 
VL-yalgea06 435.99 440.41 s0001 YOU KNOW WHAT THE BUSINESS PLAN IS ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS WHAT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN THE END 
VL-yalgea06 440.42 444.48 s0001 SO IF YOU THINK THEY CAN ANTICIPATE THAT CORRECTLY DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ALL THE OTHER STUFF 
VL-yalgea06 444.48 446.18 s0001 SO THERE'S THE YEAH 
VL-yalgea06 446.18 447.56 s0001 AH SO 
VL-yalgea06 447.57 451.45 s0001 LOOK INTO THE VEIL YOU CAN ALWAYS REDUCE A FINANCIAL EQUILIBRIUM TO GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 451.46 454.40 s0001 NOW I WANT TO GO BACK AND RE EXAMINE ALL THAT 
VL-yalgea06 454.41 455.61 s0001 LOGIC 
VL-yalgea06 455.61 457.10 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 457.11 458.37 s0001 WHAT'S THE FIRST 
VL-yalgea06 458.38 459.46 s0001 STEP 
VL-yalgea06 459.46 460.69 s0001 IN WHAT 
VL-yalgea06 460.70 462.00 s0001 AH 
VL-yalgea06 462.00 463.19 s0001 FISHER DID 
VL-yalgea06 463.20 465.21 s0001 OKAY AND THIS IS THE IDEA 
VL-yalgea06 465.21 466.52 s0001 SO OF WELL 
VL-yalgea06 466.53 468.16 s0001 NO ARBITRAGE 
VL-yalgea06 470.09 473.01 s0001 IT'S A FISHER SAID PEOPLE LOOK 
VL-yalgea06 473.01 474.15 s0001 THROUGH THE VEIL 
VL-yalgea06 474.16 478.37 s0001 OF THINGS THEY UNDERSTAND STUFF AND YOU CAN COUNT ON THEIR UNDERSTANDING 
VL-yalgea06 478.38 481.54 s0001 TO GUIDE YOUR UNDERSTANDING THE ECONOMY SO 
VL-yalgea06 481.55 482.89 s0001 IF YOU KNOW 
VL-yalgea06 482.90 484.65 s0001 THAT HIGH ALPHA 
VL-yalgea06 484.66 487.59 s0001 EQUALS THIS IS A BIG PIPE HIGH ALPHA 
VL-yalgea06 487.60 489.50 s0001 EQUALS A THIRD 
VL-yalgea06 490.23 492.26 s0001 OKAY SO FISHER SAYS 
VL-yalgea06 492.27 495.52 s0001 WELL YOU DON'T HAVE TO SOLVE FOR THE WHOLE EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 495.53 497.61 s0001 THE FIGURE OUT WHAT PI BETA IS 
VL-yalgea06 497.63 501.15 s0001 WHAT HIGH BETA BE WILL FISHER WOULD HAVE SAID 
VL-yalgea06 501.15 502.63 s0001 STOCK PAID UP 
VL-yalgea06 502.64 506.41 s0001 ALWAYS PAYS OFF EXACTLY WHAT SCOTT ALPHA PAYS OFF 
VL-yalgea06 506.43 508.35 s0001 SO THESE PEOPLE ARE RATIONAL 
VL-yalgea06 508.35 513.63 s0001 THEY'RE NOT ALLOW FOR AN ARBITRARY CYCLE ALLOW FOR SO ARBITRAGE MEANS THERE TOO 
VL-yalgea06 513.64 516.77 s0001 OF ASSETS ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE IDENTICAL 
VL-yalgea06 516.78 519.02 s0001 THEY HAVE TO SELL FOR THE SAME PRICE 
VL-yalgea06 519.03 526.45 s0001 THAT'S NO ARBITRAGE IF THEY DIDN'T IF THEY SOLD FOR DIFFERENT PRICE THERE BE AN ARBITRAGE YOU'D SELL THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONE AND BY THE CHEAPER ONE 
VL-yalgea06 526.46 528.05 s0001 AND SO YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED 
VL-yalgea06 528.05 529.43 s0001 A PERFECT TRADE OFF 
VL-yalgea06 529.45 531.34 s0001 BUT YOU HAVE GOTTEN THE DIFFERENCE OF MONEY 
VL-yalgea06 531.34 532.47 s0001 SO FEW 
VL-yalgea06 532.47 534.61 s0001 SO SINCE PILE WAS ONE THIRD 
VL-yalgea06 534.61 536.89 s0001 HI BETA HAVE STEEPLE TWO THIRDS 
VL-yalgea06 536.89 538.16 s0001 THAT'S THE FIRST 
VL-yalgea06 538.17 539.38 s0001 MOST IMPORTANT 
VL-yalgea06 539.39 541.11 s0001 PRINCIPAL FINANCE 
VL-yalgea06 541.12 543.50 s0001 A FISH ARE INTRODUCED 
VL-yalgea06 543.51 545.12 s0001 THE IDEA OF NO ARBITRAGE 
VL-yalgea06 545.13 547.66 s0001 AND MAKING DEDUCTIONS FROM NORBERT RUSH 
VL-yalgea06 547.67 554.22 s0001 SO MOST OF FINANCE IS ACTUALLY BEING WARNED MORE CLEVER ABOUT HOW TO DO NO ARBITRAGE OVER HALF OF THIS COURSE 
VL-yalgea06 554.23 555.41 s0001 IS GOING TO BE 
VL-yalgea06 555.41 557.69 s0001 LET'S LOOK AT SITUATIONS WHERE 
VL-yalgea06 557.84 561.70 s0001 YOU KNOW AT FIRST GLANCE THE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY ARBITRAGE 
VL-yalgea06 561.71 563.49 s0001 THEN YOU REALISE IF YOU'RE CLEVER ENOUGH 
VL-yalgea06 563.50 567.00 s0001 WELL YOU'LL RECOGNISE AN ARBITRAGE AND BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 567.01 570.23 s0001 WITHOUT HAVING TO KNOW ALL THE UTILITIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
VL-yalgea06 570.24 575.19 s0001 OKAY SO THAT ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS OF FIND ANSWERS TO EXPLAIN ASSET PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 575.19 578.22 s0001 YOU CAN SEE HOW AN ARBITRAGE IS GOING TO HELP DO THAT 
VL-yalgea06 578.22 583.55 s0001 BECAUSE IF YOU KNEW WHAT SOME OF THE ASSET PRICES WERE YOU COULD DEDUCE WHAT THE REST WHAT MIGHT BE 
VL-yalgea06 583.55 585.76 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING FISH ARE DEAD 
VL-yalgea06 585.77 587.29 s0001 AND HE'S YEARS THIS FACT 
VL-yalgea06 587.29 589.60 s0001 IN CONNECTING THESE TWO ECONOMIES 
VL-yalgea06 589.75 592.11 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING 
VL-yalgea06 592.12 593.57 s0001 NOW 
VL-yalgea06 593.58 594.97 s0001 THAT PRINCIPLE 
VL-yalgea06 594.97 596.96 s0001 CAN BE USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
VL-yalgea06 596.96 598.51 s0001 SO 
VL-yalgea06 598.65 600.44 s0001 LET'S SUPPOSE 
VL-yalgea06 600.45 602.65 s0001 THAT'S ANOTHER APPLICATION OF IT 
VL-yalgea06 602.65 604.37 s0001 LET'S SUPPOSE THAT 
VL-yalgea06 604.37 606.07 s0001 WE INTRODUCED 
VL-yalgea06 610.30 612.51 s0001 A NOMINAL BOND 
VL-yalgea06 616.02 617.91 s0001 WITH PAYOFF 
VL-yalgea06 619.66 621.54 s0001 ONE ONE DOLLAR 
VL-yalgea06 622.54 624.39 s0001 PERIOD TOO 
VL-yalgea06 625.84 628.57 s0001 AND SUPPOSE AS BEFORE 
VL-yalgea06 628.57 630.37 s0001 Q. ONE 
VL-yalgea06 630.51 632.86 s0001 EQUALS Q. TWO 
VL-yalgea06 632.86 634.45 s0001 EQUALS ONE AS WE'VE 
VL-yalgea06 634.46 636.15 s0001 ALREADY SUPPOSED 
VL-yalgea06 636.25 638.19 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 638.19 641.26 s0001 CAN WE FIGURE OUT SO THEN BY DEFINITION 
VL-yalgea06 641.26 643.41 s0001 THE PRICE OF THIS POND

VL-yalgea06 1336.24 1337.87 s0001 AND THE TWO BLONDES 
VL-yalgea06 1345.11 1346.56 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 1346.56 1349.67 s0001 P. WHATEVER P. TWO IS JUST ONE PLUS ARE 
VL-yalgea06 1349.69 1352.00 s0001 ONE PLUS R.'S P. ONE OF REPEAT TOO 
VL-yalgea06 1352.01 1357.72 s0001 SO OKAY I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING I AM SAYING I'M MAKING SOMETHING SIMPLE SEE MORE COMPLICATED SORRY SO JUST SAY IT AGAIN 
VL-yalgea06 1357.72 1361.16 s0001 WHEN WHEN WE WE SOLVE THAT EQUILIBRIUM OVER THERE WE GOT 
VL-yalgea06 1361.16 1364.46 s0001 WE FIGURED OUT THAT P. TWO WAS ONLY A THIRD OF P. ONE 
VL-yalgea06 1364.47 1366.59 s0001 THE PRICE WHEN PEOPLE THINK TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 1366.60 1373.18 s0001 HOW MUCH WOULD I GIVE UP OF APPLES TODAY TO GET AN APPLE NEXT YEAR THEY DON'T THINK APPLE'S NEXT YEAR WORTH NEARLY AS MUCH EXAMPLES THIS YEAR 
VL-yalgea06 1373.20 1375.02 s0001 SO THIRD OF AND THEY ONLY GIVE UP 
VL-yalgea06 1375.03 1376.86 s0001 A THIRD OF AN APPLE THIS YEAR 
VL-yalgea06 1376.86 1386.19 s0001 TO GET AN APPLE NEXT YEAR P. TWO IS THE AMOUNT YOU GIVE UP TODAY TO GET AN APPLE NEXT YEAR SO IT'S A THIRD ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT IF P. ONE IS ONE IS THAT THE WORK THOUGH 
VL-yalgea06 1386.20 1389.35 s0001 REAL INTEREST RATE THE TRADE OFF BETWEEN APPLES TOMORROW 
VL-yalgea06 1389.36 1390.60 s0001 AND APPLES TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 1390.61 1392.28 s0001 JUST P. WANT TO REPEAT TO 
VL-yalgea06 1392.29 1393.46 s0001 BECAUSE ONE 
VL-yalgea06 1393.47 1394.70 s0001 APPLE TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 1394.71 1396.65 s0001 GIVE YOU THREE APPLES TOMORROW 
VL-yalgea06 1396.66 1399.05 s0001 SO PEOPLE WANNA REPEAT TO WAS THREE 
VL-yalgea06 1399.05 1402.81 s0001 OKAY SO ONE PLUS ARTIST THREE SO 
VL-yalgea06 1403.08 1406.84 s0001 THE APPLE COULD TOMORROW IS WORTH P. TWO TIMES THE DIMMER THAN 
VL-yalgea06 1406.85 1407.89 s0001 THAT'S JUST 
VL-yalgea06 1407.90 1411.32 s0001 ONE OF THE ONE PLUS ARE TIMES THE DIVIDEND OKAY SO THE 
VL-yalgea06 1411.32 1413.26 s0001 SO THE VALUE OF A STOCK 
VL-yalgea06 1413.27 1414.31 s0001 IS THE 
VL-yalgea06 1414.32 1416.08 s0001 THAT THAT THE REAL 
VL-yalgea06 1416.09 1417.45 s0001 GIBBONS IS PAYING 
VL-yalgea06 1417.47 1418.51 s0001 IN THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea06 1418.52 1422.77 s0001 DISCOUNTED BY THE WHEEL RATE OF INTEREST TO TURNING TOMORROW'S NEXT YEAR'S GOODS 
VL-yalgea06 1422.77 1424.06 s0001 FINALLY THE EQUIVALENT 
VL-yalgea06 1424.07 1425.75 s0001 IN TERMS OF THIS YEAR'S GOODS 
VL-yalgea06 1425.76 1428.66 s0001 AND THE RACIAL THOSE TWO PRICES THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 1428.67 1430.72 s0001 AND SO THAT'S HOW YOU WOULD GET IT 
VL-yalgea06 1430.73 1434.30 s0001 SO ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THE SAME THING IS YOU COULD TURN 
VL-yalgea06 1434.62 1436.86 s0001 CASH NEXT YEAR 
VL-yalgea06 1436.87 1438.21 s0001 INTO 
VL-yalgea06 1438.23 1439.40 s0001 CASH THIS YEAR 
VL-yalgea06 1439.40 1441.73 s0001 SO ASSUMING THAT YOU WANT AS MORNING 
VL-yalgea06 1443.33 1445.14 s0001 ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT 
VL-yalgea06 1445.14 1447.38 s0001 IS ONE ONE PLUS HIGH 
VL-yalgea06 1447.39 1448.72 s0001 TIME'S D. 
VL-yalgea06 1448.72 1451.60 s0001 ALPHA TWO TIMES Q. TWO 
VL-yalgea06 1452.56 1455.55 s0001 BASE YOU TAKE THE NOMINAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 1456.57 1458.12 s0001 TIMES THAT 
VL-yalgea06 1458.13 1462.07 s0001 MONEY THAT'S BEING PRODUCED BECAUSE THE NOMINAL RATE OF INTEREST SAYS 
VL-yalgea06 1462.08 1464.10 s0001 HOW DO YOU TRADE OFF A DOLLAR TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 1464.11 1465.52 s0001 FOR A DOLLAR IN THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea06 1465.53 1467.97 s0001 SO A DOLLAR IN THE FUTURE IS WORTH 
VL-yalgea06 1467.97 1473.90 s0001 YOU KNOW SAVING IT OKAY SO ADULT THE FUTURE ISN'T WORTH USUALLY AS MUCH AS A DOLLAR TODAY'S YOU HAVE TO DISCOUNT 
VL-yalgea06 1473.91 1480.01 s0001 SO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DOLLARS IN THE FUTURE LOOK WORTH LESS DOLLARS TODAY'S YOU TAKE THE PAYOFF OF DOLLARS IN THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea06 1480.01 1482.08 s0001 DISCOUNTED BY THE NOMINAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 1482.08 1483.55 s0001 AND YOU GET TODAY'S PRICE 
VL-yalgea06 1483.56 1486.17 s0001 OR YOU TAKE THE WHEEL DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea06 1486.19 1488.11 s0001 DISCOUNT BY THE WHEEL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 1488.12 1489.88 s0001 AND YOU GET TODAY'S PRICE 
VL-yalgea06 1489.88 1492.15 s0001 IT'S 
VL-yalgea06 1492.16 1494.83 s0001 SO BOTH THOSE THINGS ARE APPLICATION 
VL-yalgea06 1494.83 1498.53 s0001 OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NO ARBOUR CHARGE LOOKING THROUGH THE MAIL 
VL-yalgea06 1498.54 1504.51 s0001 OKAY SO WHAT WAS THE NOMINAL INTEREST RATE BE IN THIS CASE IN THIS CASE YOU SEE HOW DO I KNOW THE PIAZZA WAS STILL A THIRD 
VL-yalgea06 1504.52 1508.02 s0001 BECAUSE THE REAL INTEREST RATE HASN'T CHANGED IS STILL TWO HUNDRED PERCENT 
VL-yalgea06 1508.02 1511.85 s0001 SO DEAL FOR TWO WAS ONE AND I'M STILL DOES MULTIPLYING BY ONE THIRD 
VL-yalgea06 1511.86 1513.09 s0001 SO I'M STILL GETTING 
VL-yalgea06 1513.10 1515.56 s0001 A THIRD FOR THE PRICE OF ALPHA 
VL-yalgea06 1515.56 1518.97 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S HOW SHE KNEW THAT THE ANSWER SHOULD STAY 
VL-yalgea06 1518.98 1525.31 s0001 A THIRD BECAUSE SHE KNEW NOTHING WE'LL HAVE CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY THERE FOR THE REAL INTEREST RATE COULDN'T HAVE CHANGED THEIR FOR THE PRICE OF THE STOCK 
VL-yalgea06 1525.32 1527.11 s0001 STILL HAD TO BE THE SAME 
VL-yalgea06 1527.12 1528.52 s0001 SO 
VL-yalgea06 1528.52 1530.48 s0001 HOW COULD WE USE THIS FORMULA 
VL-yalgea06 1530.49 1534.20 s0001 WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE NOMINAL INTEREST RATE IS SO WHAT IS THE NOMINAL INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea06 1534.20 1535.59 s0001 HOW MUCH 
VL-yalgea06 1535.60 1537.83 s0001 YOU PUT IN A DOLLAR TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 1537.83 1543.48 s0001 HOW MUCH HOW MANY DOLLARS CAN YOU GET OUT THE FUTURE IN THIS NEW ECONOMY WAS A HUNDRED PERCENT INFLATION 
VL-yalgea06 1544.91 1546.94 s0001 YES WELL 
VL-yalgea06 1547.59 1550.23 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S RIGHT NOW HOW DID HE DO THAT 
VL-yalgea06 1550.23 1551.62 s0001 BECAUSE LET'S DO IT 
VL-yalgea06 1551.63 1553.80 s0001 YOU TAKE ONE DOLLAR TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 1553.81 1556.98 s0001 YOU CRY SKI ONE EQUALS ONE YOU CAN BUY 
VL-yalgea06 1556.99 1558.79 s0001 THREE UNITS OF AL THOUGHT 
VL-yalgea06 1558.80 1559.93 s0001 STILL HOLD 
VL-yalgea06 1559.93 1561.93 s0001 IS THIS PRICE STILL THIRD 
VL-yalgea06 1561.93 1566.10 s0001 OKAY AND THAT TELLS YOU THAT YOU GET THREE UNITS OF X. TWO 
VL-yalgea06 1566.10 1567.89 s0001 THAT'S A DIVIDEND 
VL-yalgea06 1568.09 1570.57 s0001 OF OF THREE MINUTES OF ALPHA EACH 
VL-yalgea06 1570.58 1573.02 s0001 H. SHARE OF ALPHA PLAYS ONE 
VL-yalgea06 1573.03 1575.66 s0001 RIGHT ONE APPLES I GET THREE APPLES 
VL-yalgea06 1575.67 1577.34 s0001 BUT THAT'S EQUAL TO 
VL-yalgea06 1577.34 1581.68 s0001 A THREE TIMES TOO BECAUSE THE PRICES TO EQUAL TO SEX 
VL-yalgea06 1581.69 1583.67 s0001 YOU SIX DOLLARS 
VL-yalgea06 1583.68 1584.72 s0001 TOMORROW 
VL-yalgea06 1584.73 1586.26 s0001 SO YOU'VE TURNED ONE DOLLAR 
VL-yalgea06 1586.27 1589.68 s0001 IN THE SIX DOLLARS SO ONE PLUS A Y. EQUALS 
VL-yalgea06 1589.69 1591.11 s0001 SIX OF WINE 
VL-yalgea06 1591.12 1593.60 s0001 IMPLIES I EQUALS FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT 
VL-yalgea06 1593.61 1595.26 s0001 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID 
VL-yalgea06 1595.26 1596.77 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 1596.78 1598.06 s0001 TO SAY THAT 
VL-yalgea06 1598.07 1599.30 s0001 YOU KNOW JUST 
VL-yalgea06 1599.30 1600.62 s0001 MORE SIMPLY 
VL-yalgea06 1600.63 1602.48 s0001 THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 1602.48 1604.08 s0001 ONE PLUS ARE THIS IS 
VL-yalgea06 1604.08 1607.97 s0001 MOST FAMOUS EQUATION FISHER OF THE ROW WAS ONE PLUS A LIKE 
VL-yalgea06 1607.97 1610.32 s0001 DIVIDED BY ONE PLUS G. 
VL-yalgea06 1610.33 1617.51 s0001 OKAY SO THIS IS CALLED THE FISHER EQUATION OVERTOOK HIS FAMOUS EQUATION SO THIS THE CONSISTS CALLED THE FISHER EQUATION 
VL-yalgea06 1618.90 1620.76 s0001 AND THIS WHICH IS CALLED THE 
VL-yalgea06 1620.77 1622.64 s0001 THESE TWO THINGS WHICH ARE THE SAME 
VL-yalgea06 1622.65 1625.76 s0001 I CALL THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ASSET PRICING 
VL-yalgea06 1632.68 1638.87 s0001 OKAY SO WHY IS THIS THEOREM TRUE THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST RATES OFF APPLES TODAY FOR APPLES 
VL-yalgea06 1638.88 1645.92 s0001 FOR ALL THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST APPLES TODAY FOR APPLE'S TOMORROW'S WE HAD ONE APPLE GIVING YOU THREE APPLES THAT'S WHY ARE WAS TWO HUNDRED PERCENT 
VL-yalgea06 1645.93 1647.16 s0001 WELL 
VL-yalgea06 1647.17 1650.49 s0001 IF INFLATION IS A HUNDRED PERCENT SO THIS IS TOO 
VL-yalgea06 1650.49 1654.53 s0001 OKAY ONE APPLE TODAY GIVES YOU THREE APPLES IN THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea06 1654.54 1656.68 s0001 WHAT THAT MEANS ONE APPLE TODAY GIVES YOU 
VL-yalgea06 1656.69 1661.13 s0001 ONE DOLLAR IS ONE APPLE TODAY GIVES YOU THREE APPLES OR SIX DOLLARS IN THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea06 1661.13 1662.53 s0001 SO THAT'S WHY 
VL-yalgea06 1662.53 1663.72 s0001 WE HAVE TO TAKE 
VL-yalgea06 1663.73 1665.37 s0001 UM SO 
VL-yalgea06 1665.38 1669.06 s0001 THREE TIMES TO SORT THIS IS EQUAL TO THREE 
VL-yalgea06 1669.07 1671.87 s0001 INFLATION IS A HUNDRED PERCENT SO THIS IS EQUAL TO TWO 
VL-yalgea06 1671.88 1675.90 s0001 THE WHAT'S THE FAIR RATE OF INTEREST WELL THE BANKS CAN BE WELL ANY BANKER 
VL-yalgea06 1675.91 1677.15 s0001 CAN TAKE A DOLLAR 
VL-yalgea06 1677.16 1680.05 s0001 BY A STOCK TURN TO THREE UNITS OF DIVIDENDS 
VL-yalgea06 1680.06 1683.26 s0001 AND THEN SELL IT FOR TWO DOLLARS APIECE AND GET SIX DOLLARS 
VL-yalgea06 1683.27 1688.44 s0001 AND SO A BANKER CAN TAKE A DOLLAR AND TURNED THE SEX OF COMPETITION TO FORCE THE BANKERS TO GIVE YOU 
VL-yalgea06 1688.45 1691.20 s0001 SIX DOLLARS FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR YOU GIVE IT NEXT PERIOD 
VL-yalgea06 1691.20 1694.40 s0001 SO THE INTEREST RATE HAS TO BE ONE PLUS 
VL-yalgea06 1694.41 1695.45 s0001 HI 
VL-yalgea06 1695.46 1697.90 s0001 EQUALS THREE TIMES TO FOR SEX 
VL-yalgea06 1697.91 1702.13 s0001 SO THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST IS THE NOMINAL RATE OF INTEREST DIVIDED BY INFLATION 
VL-yalgea06 1703.02 1704.73 s0001 OKAY AND 
VL-yalgea06 1704.74 1706.39 s0001 SO THAT'S ONE 
VL-yalgea06 1706.92 1712.83 s0001 SUBTLE BUT YOU KNOW ONCE YOU REALISE THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION OF THINKING PEOPLE ARE RATIONAL AND MAKE 
VL-yalgea06 1712.84 1715.61 s0001 SORT OF SIMPLE CALCULATIONS 
VL-yalgea06 1715.61 1722.61 s0001 ARE LOOKING AT THE FUTURE AND A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS THE PRICE OF ASSETS OR YOU LOOK AT THE CASH THAT COMES OUT IN THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea06 1722.62 1729.98 s0001 DISCOUNTED BY THE NADAL INTEREST RATE OR YOU LOOK AT THE REAL GOODS THAT COME OUT OF THE FUTURE IN DISCOUNTED BY THE REAL INTEREST RATE AND 
VL-yalgea06 1730.00 1731.86 s0001 IT'S ALL THE SAME THING 
VL-yalgea06 1732.36 1734.69 s0001 OKAY SO DOES ANYBODY KNOW 
VL-yalgea06 1734.71 1736.00 s0001 WHAT WE 
VL-yalgea06 1736.00 1738.33 s0001 INFLATION IS TODAY OR WHAT THE 
VL-yalgea06 1738.34 1740.58 s0001 NOMINAL INTEREST RATES ARE TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 1740.58 1743.14 s0001 SO I IS THE NOMINAL INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea06 1743.15 1745.07 s0001 AMOUNT OF INTERESTING PUT IN A 
VL-yalgea06 1745.09 1748.23 s0001 THE BANK AND WHAT THEY'LL PAY YOU AT THE END OF THE YEAR 
VL-yalgea06 1748.24 1749.59 s0001 SO WE'RE GOING ON 
VL-yalgea06 1749.59 1752.18 s0001 NEXT CLASS WE CAN FIND OUT THE EXACT 
VL-yalgea06 1752.19 1754.26 s0001 NUMBERS BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT 
VL-yalgea06 1754.26 1755.98 s0001 AND HAVE ANY IDEA 
VL-yalgea06 1758.77 1761.48 s0001 TAKE A WILD GUESS IS THAT TEN PERCENT 
VL-yalgea06 1761.48 1763.17 s0001 FIVE PERCENT YUP 
VL-yalgea06 1765.64 1769.99 s0001 USUALLY AND YOU THINK IT'S HIGHER OR LOWER THAN USUAL NOWADAYS 
VL-yalgea06 1770.56 1773.66 s0001 OKAY THAT'S GOOD SO LET'S SAY IT'S AROUND 
VL-yalgea06 1773.68 1776.95 s0001 TWO PERCENT SO THAT MEANS THIS IS ONE POINT OH TUNED 
VL-yalgea06 1776.96 1779.92 s0001 AND WHAT YOU THINK THE NOMINAL INTEREST RATE IS NOW 
VL-yalgea06 1780.82 1782.90 s0001 ONE WHO SAID THAT THAT'S A GOOD 
VL-yalgea06 1782.91 1785.32 s0001 ONE PERCENT OKAY THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT 
VL-yalgea06 1785.32 1786.84 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 1786.84 1789.35 s0001 WHAT IS THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST NOW 
VL-yalgea06 1790.06 1791.80 s0001 WHAT 
VL-yalgea06 1792.86 1798.94 s0001 IT'S LET WELL LESS THAN ONE PLUS R.'S LESS THAN ONE SO SO ART ONE PLUS ARE 
VL-yalgea06 1799.04 1801.61 s0001 IS A ROUND POINT NINETY NINE 
VL-yalgea06 1801.62 1805.10 s0001 OKAY SO THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST IS ACTUALLY LIKE MAKE IT A ONE PERCENT 
VL-yalgea06 1805.11 1810.11 s0001 HOW DID THAT HAPPEN DO YOU THINK IT'S STANDARD HAVE THE REAL INTEREST RATE BE UNDER ZERO 
VL-yalgea06 1810.11 1812.01 s0001 SO WHY IS IT UNDER ZERO 
VL-yalgea06 1812.37 1815.91 s0001 WHAT'S GOING ON NOW THAT WOULD MAKE THAT HAPPEN UP 
VL-yalgea06 1817.71 1819.85 s0001 AH HA THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
VL-yalgea06 1819.86 1828.71 s0001 HAS CUT THE INTEREST RATE THE NOMINAL ENJOYED THAT IT LANDS AT THE VERY YOU KNOW TO BE CLOSE TO ZERO WHAT'S A TO ONE PERCENT OF THE ONE YEAR BOND OF ZERO ON A 
VL-yalgea06 1828.72 1830.06 s0001 THREE MONTH THING 
VL-yalgea06 1830.06 1840.61 s0001 OKAY AND SO THE REASON THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE DOING THAT IS TO STIMULATE INVESTMENT THAT'S WHAT THEY TEACH YOU IN MACRO KEYNESIAN STIMULATE INVESTMENT WHERE TO FIND OUT THAT THAT'S NOT THE REASON THEY'RE DOING IT AT ALL 
VL-yalgea06 1840.62 1845.70 s0001 THE REASON THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS CUTTING INTEREST RATE OF ZERO IS TO JUST GIVE MONEY AWAY TO THE BANKS 
VL-yalgea06 1845.72 1849.41 s0001 AND WHY IS THAT WHEN YOU PUT YOUR MONEY AND DEPOSIT IN THE BANK 
VL-yalgea06 1849.42 1852.80 s0001 GETTING ALMOST NO INTEREST SO THE BANKS THE BIG BANGS 
VL-yalgea06 1852.81 1857.72 s0001 ARE ALL THESE DEPOSITS AND PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEY DON'T CHANGE WHAT THEY DO THEY JUST LEAVE THEIR MONEY IN THE BANK 
VL-yalgea06 1857.73 1860.71 s0001 GETTING NO INTEREST SO THE BANKS HAVE THE MONEY FOR FREE 
VL-yalgea06 1860.71 1863.80 s0001 AND THEY CAN YOU KNOW MAKE MONEY WITH IT AND SO THERE 
VL-yalgea06 1863.81 1871.58 s0001 NORMALLY THEY HAVE TO PAY THREE PERCENT INTEREST OR SOMETHING AND THAT WOULD BE EXPENSIVE FOR THEM AN ANIMAL YOU KNOW THAT EXPENSES A BIG PART OF THEIR EXPENSES THEY DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE 
VL-yalgea06 1871.59 1876.56 s0001 OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA COME BACK TO THAT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON TODAY BUT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON BUT ANYWAY THE POINT IS 
VL-yalgea06 1876.57 1884.40 s0001 WHEN A LOW INTEREST RATE IS SOMEHOW CONTROLLED BY THE FED THAT'S WHY WE DON'T HAVE A THEORY OF WHAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO MACRO IN THIS COURSE SO FISHER 
VL-yalgea06 1884.41 1887.65 s0001 DOESN'T HAVE A THEORY OF THE NOMINAL INTEREST RATE YOU KNOW OF INFLATION 
VL-yalgea06 1887.66 1890.04 s0001 BUT IT DOES TELL YOU GIVEN INFLATION AND THEN 
VL-yalgea06 1890.05 1894.38 s0001 NAMA NO INFLATION AND ALL INTEREST RATE THAT'S DETERMINING A REAL INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea06 1894.39 1896.54 s0001 OKAY AND PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK THROUGH THAT 
VL-yalgea06 1896.54 1901.70 s0001 SO NOW THEY SHOULD SAY THIS IS SORT OF A KEYNESIAN PART THEY SHOULD REALISE THAT ACTUALLY 
VL-yalgea06 1901.82 1903.53 s0001 AN APPLE TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 1903.53 1904.98 s0001 YOU KNOW A 
VL-yalgea06 1904.98 1908.72 s0001 IF YOU KNOW IF YOU JUST SORT OF PUT IN THE BANK YOU GET LESS THAN AN APPLE 
VL-yalgea06 1908.73 1919.51 s0001 IN THE FUTURE SO YOU SHOULD SPEND IT AND DO SOMETHING WITH THAT THAT'S THE KEYNESIAN IDEA SO PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHY FURTHER AWAY PART OF YOUR APPLE DO SOMETHING WITH THAT THAT'S WHAT'S WAS TO STIMULATE DEMAND AN ACTIVITY TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 1919.51 1921.23 s0001 OKAY SO POINTERS 
VL-yalgea06 1921.23 1925.92 s0001 THAT'S HOW YOU CALCULATE THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST AND BY YOU KNOW A SHOCKINGLY 
VL-yalgea06 1925.93 1928.43 s0001 IT'S A NEGATIVE IT'S HARDLY EVER NEGATIVE 
VL-yalgea06 1928.43 1929.68 s0001 THEY CAN BE MADE 
VL-yalgea06 1929.68 1931.94 s0001 OKAY THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT 
VL-yalgea06 1931.94 1934.94 s0001 THERE'S NO ARBITRAGE BUSINESS 
VL-yalgea06 1936.59 1938.61 s0001 RIGHT SO 
VL-yalgea06 1939.36 1941.10 s0001 UM 
VL-yalgea06 1954.19 1955.81 s0001 SO 
VL-yalgea06 1955.81 1958.09 s0001 LET'S DO ONE MORE A 
VL-yalgea06 1958.10 1959.15 s0001 TRICK HERE 
VL-yalgea06 1959.15 1960.22 s0001 FISHER THING 
VL-yalgea06 1960.23 1962.34 s0001 SUPPOSE THAT A NEW 
VL-yalgea06 1962.35 1963.74 s0001 UM 
VL-yalgea06 1964.36 1968.01 s0001 LET'S GO BACK TO THE EQUILIBRIUM WITH Q. ONE 
VL-yalgea06 1969.29 1972.51 s0001 IF YOU WANT EQUAL ONE AND Q. TWO WE CALL ON 
VL-yalgea06 1974.83 1977.36 s0001 SUPPOSE ARE 
VL-yalgea06 1977.58 1979.67 s0001 SUPPOSE CHINA 
VL-yalgea06 1981.22 1983.79 s0001 OFFERED THROUGH 
VL-yalgea06 1984.47 1990.02 s0001 WHEN MONEY LENDERS DOLLARS AND ZERO PERCENT INTEREST WOULD THAT BE A GREAT 
VL-yalgea06 1990.02 1991.50 s0001 MEAL 
VL-yalgea06 1993.86 1996.10 s0001 PEOPLE RUSH TO DO THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2003.99 2007.70 s0001 THIS IS THE EQUILIBRIUM WE SOLVED OVER HERE ALREADY 
VL-yalgea06 2010.38 2018.81 s0001 SO IS THAT A GREAT DEAL WITH THAT UPSET THE EQUILIBRIUM WHEN ANYONE BOTHER TO TAKE THE CHINESE DEAL THEY LANDED ZERO PERCENT INTEREST THEY WERE OFFERING TO DO THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2029.88 2031.68 s0001 IT WOULDN'T TAKE IT 
VL-yalgea06 2033.97 2035.60 s0001 WE'RE BACK HERE 
VL-yalgea06 2035.61 2038.78 s0001 WHAT'S THE NOMINAL INTEREST RATE IN THIS ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2041.00 2047.87 s0001 TWO HUNDRED PERCENTAGES SO SO IF YOU WANNA BROW IN THIS ECONOMY FOR ANOTHER AMERICAN YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE GUY TWO HUNDRED PERCENT INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 2047.87 2051.10 s0001 HERE THE CHINESE ARE OFFERING TO LEND YOU WOULD ZERO PERCENTAGE OF SILK 
VL-yalgea06 2051.11 2053.71 s0001 SO YES EVERYONE WOULD RUSH TO TAKE THE THING 
VL-yalgea06 2053.71 2060.91 s0001 AND AH OKAY NOW I HAVE A BIGGER FACTOR WHAT THE EQUILIBRIUM WASN'T THE CHINESE ARE WILLING TO LEND MONEY AT SUCH A LOW RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 2060.91 2063.48 s0001 OKAY LET'S TRY ANOTHER QUESTION 
VL-yalgea06 2063.50 2065.44 s0001 SUPPOSE YOU COULD TURN 
VL-yalgea06 2065.44 2069.46 s0001 SUPPOSE YOU INVENTED THE TECHNOLOGY MEAN TECHNOLOGY 
VL-yalgea06 2072.42 2075.94 s0001 NEW TECHNOLOGY TURNS 
VL-yalgea06 2075.94 2077.76 s0001 ONE UNIT 
VL-yalgea06 2077.89 2079.96 s0001 ONE APPLE TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 2079.98 2081.57 s0001 INTO 
VL-yalgea06 2081.57 2084.09 s0001 TWO APPLES TOMORROW 
VL-yalgea06 2086.34 2088.99 s0001 IS THIS SOMETHING PEOPLE WOULD RUSH TO DO 
VL-yalgea06 2089.00 2091.42 s0001 OR NOT SUPPOSE SOMEONE INVENTOR 
VL-yalgea06 2091.44 2093.03 s0001 FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2093.03 2096.89 s0001 WE RUSH TO DO IT COULD BE USED TO HELP THE ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2096.90 2098.40 s0001 SO PUT IT THIS WAY 
VL-yalgea06 2098.41 2100.62 s0001 COULD THIS MEAN TECHNOLOGY 
VL-yalgea06 2102.54 2104.82 s0001 NEW TECHNOLOGY 
VL-yalgea06 2107.38 2109.09 s0001 BE USED 
VL-yalgea06 2109.09 2111.08 s0001 TO MAKE 
VL-yalgea06 2111.15 2113.34 s0001 OPERATING IMPROVEMENT 
VL-yalgea06 2113.96 2116.04 s0001 EVERYBODY BETTER OFF 
VL-yalgea06 2136.86 2139.75 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S EXACTLY THE RIGHT ANSWER THE ANSWER IS 
VL-yalgea06 2139.75 2143.67 s0001 IT IT ACTUALLY YOU'RE ANSWERING TWO QUESTIONS ASKED TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS 
VL-yalgea06 2143.67 2155.60 s0001 COULD IT BE USED TO HELP THE ECONOMY MAKE EVERYBODY BETTER OFFER FOR SOCIAL PLANNER WAS IN CHARGE OF THINGS AND THE CHINESE INVENTED THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY OR SOME AMERICAN ALASKAN VANDALISM TECHNOLOGY 
VL-yalgea06 2155.62 2162.27 s0001 YOU KNOW SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT A USE THE TECHNOLOGY IN COULD USE THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE EVERYBODY BETTER OFF 
VL-yalgea06 2162.28 2163.92 s0001 THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO 
VL-yalgea06 2163.92 2174.27 s0001 AND THEY'RE NOT ANSWER TO A SECOND QUESTION IS SUPPOSED TO GUIDE ALASKA DISCOVERED HIMSELF HE DIDN'T COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THE PARADE OF IMPROVEMENT HELPING OTHER GUYS OF THE AMERICAN PLANNERS OR ANYTHING 
VL-yalgea06 2174.28 2176.89 s0001 HE JUST WANTED TO MAKE A PROFIT FOR HIMSELF 
VL-yalgea06 2177.19 2180.64 s0001 WHEN YOU MAKE A PROFIT THE ANSWER IS NO BECAUSE 
VL-yalgea06 2180.66 2184.77 s0001 SO YOU KNOW THE REAL PRICES FOR ISSUANCE AIR ONE AND A THIRD 
VL-yalgea06 2184.77 2192.28 s0001 OKAY AND AND THIS WOULD DO YOU NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT THE INTEREST RATE IS TWO HUNDRED THE RATE YOU KNOW WHO HE IS LOSING MONEY IS GIVING SOMETHING 
VL-yalgea06 2192.28 2196.54 s0001 UP THAT'S WORTH ONE IS GETTING SOMETHING THAT'S ONLY WORTH A TWO THIRDS 
VL-yalgea06 2196.55 2198.96 s0001 SO MAYBE LOSING MONEY TO DO IT YOU LOSE MONEY 
VL-yalgea06 2198.96 2200.17 s0001 SO 
VL-yalgea06 2200.17 2201.73 s0001 WE COULD PROVE THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2201.75 2202.81 s0001 EVEN 
VL-yalgea06 2202.81 2203.86 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 2203.87 2204.91 s0001 SO 
VL-yalgea06 2204.92 2206.30 s0001 THE ANSWER IS 
VL-yalgea06 2206.30 2207.61 s0001 NO 
VL-yalgea06 2207.61 2209.40 s0001 THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION 
VL-yalgea06 2209.41 2211.19 s0001 AND NOBODY WOULD DO IT ANYWAY 
VL-yalgea06 2211.21 2213.11 s0001 AND FORTUNATELY 
VL-yalgea06 2214.86 2216.60 s0001 NOBODY 
VL-yalgea06 2216.67 2219.96 s0001 WE CHOOSE TO DO IT CHOOSE TO USE IT 
VL-yalgea06 2221.08 2222.69 s0001 USE IT 
VL-yalgea06 2222.69 2224.81 s0001 BECAUSE IT LOSES MONEY 
VL-yalgea06 2229.40 2233.39 s0001 OKAY SO THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE QUESTIONS YOU KNOW COULD HAVE BEEN USED IT 
VL-yalgea06 2233.39 2239.00 s0001 AND WOULD ANYONE CHOOSE ANY INDIVIDUAL CHOOSE TO DO IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE SOCIETY ONE INDIVIDUAL CHOOSE TO DO IT 
VL-yalgea06 2239.00 2240.82 s0001 THE ANSWERS HAPPEN TO AGREE HERE 
VL-yalgea06 2240.83 2244.67 s0001 SO WHY CAN'T IT BE USED AS A PRATER IMPROVEMENT WHAT'S THE PROOF 
VL-yalgea06 2244.67 2246.58 s0001 WHAT'S THE PROOF OF THIS 
VL-yalgea06 2246.59 2249.73 s0001 CAMPING THE ANSWERS KNOW WHAT'S THE TRUTH 
VL-yalgea06 2251.73 2253.40 s0001 THE PROOF IS THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2253.41 2254.92 s0001 IF THE DEAD 
VL-yalgea06 2255.17 2257.35 s0001 AND IN THE END 
VL-yalgea06 2259.35 2262.36 s0001 AND IT LED TO AN ALLOCATION 
VL-yalgea06 2265.44 2268.17 s0001 X. HAVE ANYONE 
VL-yalgea06 2268.17 2272.24 s0001 IT'S CALLED X. GLOBAL A ONE X. TOO LITTLE TOO 
VL-yalgea06 2272.78 2274.93 s0001 NEXT WILL BE ONE 
VL-yalgea06 2274.92 2277.00 s0001 THANKS TO IT'LL BE TOO 
VL-yalgea06 2278.30 2280.71 s0001 MADE EVERYONE BETTER OFF 
VL-yalgea06 2285.16 2286.79 s0001 OKAY MAN 
VL-yalgea06 2286.80 2288.37 s0001 WELL WE GIVE THEIR OLD PROFILE 
VL-yalgea06 2288.38 2295.63 s0001 AND WHAT IT MEANS THAT P. WAN TEXT WHITTLE A ONE PLUS P. TWO TAXED WITH ALL EIGHTY TWO 
VL-yalgea06 2295.63 2299.36 s0001 IS BETTER THAN WATCH P. WANT E. HALF A LOT 
VL-yalgea06 2299.36 2303.51 s0001 RIGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE IN THE FISHER ECONOMY PLUS P. TWO 
VL-yalgea06 2303.51 2305.20 s0001 BE HAPPY TO 
VL-yalgea06 2305.19 2306.52 s0001 AND SEVERAL LADIES 
VL-yalgea06 2306.52 2309.57 s0001 T. WANT X. TWO IT'LL BE WANTING 
VL-yalgea06 2309.57 2312.62 s0001 POST P. TWO X. WILL BE TOO 
VL-yalgea06 2313.28 2315.02 s0001 P. ONE 
VL-yalgea06 2316.44 2318.42 s0001 AT THE ONE 
VL-yalgea06 2319.50 2321.44 s0001 PLUS P. TWO 
VL-yalgea06 2321.82 2323.61 s0001 HE HAD BEEN TOO 
VL-yalgea06 2323.83 2325.75 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 2325.76 2327.65 s0001 WHY IS THAT BECAUSE 
VL-yalgea06 2327.66 2330.29 s0001 IN THIS FISHER ECONOMY THE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 2330.30 2335.07 s0001 IF THIS ALLOCATION REALLY MADE A BETTER OFF THAN WHAT HE'S GOTTEN THAN FOUR THIRDS AND 
VL-yalgea06 2335.08 2337.42 s0001 AND TWO HE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN IT 
VL-yalgea06 2337.42 2342.13 s0001 AND SHE WOULD BE SHE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN HER THING IT WAS BETTER THAN TWO THIRDS INTO 
VL-yalgea06 2342.14 2348.29 s0001 SO CLEARLY THERE MUST HAVE BEEN TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THOSE TO CHOOSE BECAUSE THEY WERE RATIONALLY CHOOSING THE RIGHT THING GIVEN WHAT THEY COULD AFFORD 
VL-yalgea06 2348.30 2350.69 s0001 SO THEN YOU JUST ADD THE STUFF UP 
VL-yalgea06 2351.23 2352.88 s0001 ADD 
VL-yalgea06 2352.88 2354.65 s0001 AND YOU FIND THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2354.65 2357.09 s0001 TOTAL CONSUMPTION VALUE 
VL-yalgea06 2359.29 2362.86 s0001 IS BETTER THAN TOTAL ENDOWMENT VALUE 
VL-yalgea06 2365.11 2367.29 s0001 OKAY THAT'S ENOUGH ESCHER ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2367.29 2370.39 s0001 BUT WE'VE CHANGED THE FISHER ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2370.40 2378.39 s0001 OKAY BECAUSE NOW WE'VE ADDED THIS TECHNOLOGY WHICH TOOK OUR WAY SOME OF THE FIRST GOOD AND MADE IT INTO THE SECOND GOOD BUT THAT TECHNOLOGY WAS LOST MONEY 
VL-yalgea06 2378.40 2380.21 s0001 WHICH IS BIGGER THAN 
VL-yalgea06 2380.65 2382.40 s0001 VALUE 
VL-yalgea06 2383.44 2386.42 s0001 IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2389.73 2395.23 s0001 RIGHT SO LET ME JUST SAY THIS AND SO THAT'S A CONTRADICTION BECAUSE THE CONSUMPTION OF THIS 
VL-yalgea06 2395.25 2402.84 s0001 HOWEVER THE NEW TECHNOLOGY GOT USED IN THE AND THE TOTAL CONSUMPTION OF THE PEOPLE HAD TO BE THE TOTAL OF WHAT THERE WAS AND WHAT WAS PRODUCED IN THE ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2402.84 2406.89 s0001 THE VALUE AFTER THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES INTRODUCED IN THAT NEW ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2406.90 2410.08 s0001 HAS ONLY GONE DOWN COMPARED TO THE FISHER ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2410.08 2413.86 s0001 AND THE FISHER ECONOMY VALUE OF ENDOWMENTS MOST OF THE MOLAS THAN THIS 
VL-yalgea06 2413.87 2415.67 s0001 BRILLIANT NEW ALLOCATION 
VL-yalgea06 2415.67 2418.87 s0001 AND THAT'S A CONTRADICTION BECAUSE THIS NEW ALLOCATION HAS TO END UP 
VL-yalgea06 2418.89 2422.33 s0001 THE THE STUFF THAT'S THERE AND THE NEW TECHNOLOGY ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2422.34 2424.96 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S HOW WE KNOW THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2424.96 2428.55 s0001 NO NEW TECHNOLOGY COULD POSSIBLY MAKE EVERYBODY BETTER OFF 
VL-yalgea06 2428.55 2434.18 s0001 AND WE KNOW TRIVIA WAY THAT IF IT LOSES OKAY IT MAKE IT MAKES EVERYONE BETTER OFF IF AND ONLY A 
VL-yalgea06 2434.42 2436.05 s0001 IT MAKES A PROFIT 
VL-yalgea06 2436.06 2438.17 s0001 SO IF AND ONLY IF IT MAKES A PROFIT 
VL-yalgea06 2438.17 2440.56 s0001 CAN BE USED TO MAKE EVERYBODY BETTER OFF 
VL-yalgea06 2440.61 2442.14 s0001 AND AMAZINGLY 
VL-yalgea06 2442.15 2443.95 s0001 IN A FREE MARKET ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2443.96 2449.82 s0001 PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE IT IF AND ONLY IF IT MAKES A PROFIT SO THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT IF AND ONLY IF IT'S A GOOD THING FOR THE ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2449.83 2451.44 s0001 SO THAT'S THE BASIC 
VL-yalgea06 2451.62 2453.77 s0001 LAISSEZ FAIRE ARGUMENT THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2453.79 2458.21 s0001 THEIR NEW DISCOVERIES ALL THE TIME EVERY OTHER DAY SOMEBODY'S THINKING OF SOMETHING NEW 
VL-yalgea06 2458.21 2463.23 s0001 ARE WE ARE WE GOING TO USE IT SHOULD WE USE IT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO READ ABOUT THE PAPERS AND USE WELL 
VL-yalgea06 2464.19 2466.04 s0001 THE WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea06 2466.04 2470.00 s0001 THE DISCOVERS THEMSELVES ARE GOING TO TALK TO THEIR BUSINESS TRENDS AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY 
VL-yalgea06 2470.02 2472.65 s0001 YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO LEND ME THE MONEY TO GET THIS THING GOING 
VL-yalgea06 2472.66 2475.23 s0001 AND ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO DO THIS PROFIT CALCULATION 
VL-yalgea06 2475.25 2477.09 s0001 IF THEY DECIDE IT LOSES MONEY 
VL-yalgea06 2477.10 2478.15 s0001 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO WHAT 
VL-yalgea06 2478.16 2482.10 s0001 AND THANK GOD FOR THAT BECAUSE IT COULDN'T HAVE HELPED EVERYBODY IF THEY DID USE IT 
VL-yalgea06 2482.10 2483.19 s0001 SO THAT'S 
VL-yalgea06 2483.21 2485.09 s0001 THE MAIN LESSON OF LAISSEZ FAIRE 
VL-yalgea06 2485.10 2486.69 s0001 SO LET ME 
VL-yalgea06 2487.85 2490.14 s0001 PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE A LITTLE BIT 
VL-yalgea06 2490.15 2493.02 s0001 IN THE OLD RUSSIAN ECONOMY OF THE NINETEEN 
VL-yalgea06 2493.02 2494.85 s0001 THIRTIES AND FORTIES 
VL-yalgea06 2494.92 2499.37 s0001 THERE WAS NO PROFIT SYSTEM SO THE CENTRAL PLANNER HAD TO FIGURE OUT 
VL-yalgea06 2499.37 2507.02 s0001 SHOULD A NEW INVENTION BE USED OR NOT SO EVERY TIME THERE'S A NEW INVENTION A COMMITTEE HAD TO GET TOGETHER CENTRAL PLANNERS AND DECIDE WHETHER TO USE IT OR NOT 
VL-yalgea06 2507.03 2509.48 s0001 AND THERE'S A FAMOUS GUY NAMED CANTOR OVERAGE 
VL-yalgea06 2509.48 2512.65 s0001 WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF A LOT OF THAT HE WON THE NOBEL PRIZE 
VL-yalgea06 2512.66 2516.81 s0001 UM IN ECONOMICS TO SHARE IT WITH THE YALE ECONOMIST IN COUPONS 
VL-yalgea06 2516.81 2518.96 s0001 AND SO CAN THROW WHICH TOLD THIS 
VL-yalgea06 2518.96 2522.85 s0001 VERY AMUSING STORY HE SAID THAT THERE WERE TWO CENTRAL PLANNING GIRLS 
VL-yalgea06 2522.85 2529.00 s0001 ONE WAS IN CHARGE OF ALLOCATIONS AND ONE WAS IN CHARGE OF PRICES ONE HAD TO SET THE PRICES THE OTHER HAD THIS AT THE ALLOCATIONS 
VL-yalgea06 2529.02 2530.85 s0001 AND OF COURSE THE WHOLE MESSAGE HERE 
VL-yalgea06 2530.86 2533.27 s0001 IS THAT YOU HAVE TO COMBINE THESE YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
VL-yalgea06 2533.28 2535.67 s0001 IT'S WORTHWHILE TO CHANGE THE ALLOCATION 
VL-yalgea06 2535.67 2538.96 s0001 UNTIL YOU KNOW WHETHER THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT OR NOT 
VL-yalgea06 2538.96 2546.42 s0001 AND HERE THEY HAD THE TWO THINGS SEPARATED THEY WERE TELLING PEOPLE WHAT TO DO BEFORE KNOWING WHETHER THEY MADE A PROFIT AND I CAN NEVER PRICES TO THE WEREN'T FREE MARKETS 
VL-yalgea06 2546.42 2548.21 s0001 BUT ANYWAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 2548.23 2550.78 s0001 OKAY SO THE BOTTOM LINE OF B. 
VL-yalgea06 2550.78 2552.02 s0001 FISHER STORY 
VL-yalgea06 2552.02 2553.07 s0001 IS THAT YOU TAKE 
VL-yalgea06 2553.08 2555.46 s0001 THIS COMPLICATED FINANCIAL ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2555.46 2560.44 s0001 YOU REDUCE IT TO SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE THAT YOU LEARN HOW TO DO IN YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR YOUR SOPHOMORE YEAR 
VL-yalgea06 2560.44 2561.48 s0001 SOLVE THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2561.50 2565.13 s0001 AND GO BACK TO THIS AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND A LOT ABOUT THIS ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2565.13 2566.90 s0001 THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea06 2566.90 2569.85 s0001 DIDN'T REALIZE AT THE TIME AND STILL DON'T REALISE NOW 
VL-yalgea06 2569.86 2574.10 s0001 SO YOU ASK A TYPICAL PERSON IF THERE'S INFLATION THAT MEANS THE VALUE THE STOCK IS GOING TO BE 
VL-yalgea06 2574.11 2576.45 s0001 THE DIVIDENDS NEXT YEAR'S GOING TO BE HIGHER 
VL-yalgea06 2576.46 2581.92 s0001 IS ACTING TO RAISE THE VALUE THE STOCK TODAY JUST LIKE HE SAID YES OF COURSE BECAUSE IT MAKES THE PRICE OF A 
VL-yalgea06 2581.92 2583.85 s0001 THE DIVIDENDS HIGHER TOMORROW 
VL-yalgea06 2583.86 2587.22 s0001 FISHER WOULD SAY NO IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING WE'LL IN THE ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 2587.23 2588.67 s0001 IF THERE'S MORE INFLATION 
VL-yalgea06 2588.69 2590.99 s0001 SO BE A HIGHER NOMINAL INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea06 2591.00 2594.77 s0001 SO THE DISCOUNTED BY THE HIGHER INTEREST RATE PAY ALSO THE STOCK 
VL-yalgea06 2594.78 2597.57 s0001 WILL GIVE YOU THE SAME STOCK PRICES BEFORE 
VL-yalgea06 2597.76 2599.77 s0001 OKAY SO ARE THERE 
VL-yalgea06 2600.28 2601.81 s0001 SO WE'RE GOING TO UH UH 
VL-yalgea06 2601.81 2602.88 s0001 THOUSAND UP 
VL-yalgea06 2602.88 2605.27 s0001 EXAMPLES OF THIS WITH ANY QUESTIONS 
VL-yalgea06 2605.28 2606.81 s0001 ABOUT THIS YES 
VL-yalgea06 2610.60 2614.14 s0001 YEAH SORRY OFFICES IN THE WAY BY THE WAY 
VL-yalgea06 2615.26 2619.74 s0001 OKAY SO THIS IS THE OREGON WE GAVE A FEW CLASSES AGO I FORGOT WHEN 
VL-yalgea06 2619.73 2621.58 s0001 WE SAID HOW DO YOU KNOW 
VL-yalgea06 2621.59 2625.55 s0001 THAT A FINAL ALLOCATION THAT EMERGES AS A COMPETITIVE EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 2625.55 2627.05 s0001 IS PRAY DO FISSION 
VL-yalgea06 2627.06 2628.31 s0001 AND THE ARGUMENT WAS 
VL-yalgea06 2628.32 2629.86 s0001 IF YOU CAN DO BETTER 
VL-yalgea06 2629.87 2631.73 s0001 THAT MEANS MAKE EVERYBODY BETTER OFF 
VL-yalgea06 2631.73 2636.56 s0001 THEN THEY EACH PERSON IF YOU LOOK AT THE VALUE OF WHAT THEY'RE GETTING UNDER THE NEW REGIME 
VL-yalgea06 2636.57 2640.31 s0001 IT MUST BE MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THEIR ENDOWMENTS OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE CHOSEN 
VL-yalgea06 2640.32 2643.85 s0001 THE NEW MACHINE AND NOBODY CHOSE THAT MEANS EVERYBODY 
VL-yalgea06 2643.86 2646.64 s0001 WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY MORE FOR THIS 
VL-yalgea06 2646.65 2650.30 s0001 NEW REGIME ALLOCATION THEN THE VALUE OF THEIR ENDOWMENTS 
VL-yalgea06 2650.30 2652.26 s0001 OKAY SO THIS IS MORE THAN THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2652.27 2653.50 s0001 PERSON A AND 
VL-yalgea06 2653.50 2659.17 s0001 PERSON B.'S CONSUMPTION IS MORE THAN A VALUE HIS ENDOWMENTS IS EXTENDED ENDOWMENTS IN THE FISHER THING 
VL-yalgea06 2659.24 2662.04 s0001 UNDER THIS NEW REGIME THAN THE VALUE OF HIS ENDOWMENTS 
VL-yalgea06 2662.04 2663.35 s0001 YOU'RE FOLLOWING THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2663.36 2666.81 s0001 OKAY THEN THE NEXT STEP WAS TO ADD ALL THIS UP 
VL-yalgea06 2666.81 2668.49 s0001 OKAY NOW NOTICE ENOUGH 
VL-yalgea06 2668.49 2670.49 s0001 HOWEVER THE NEW TECHNOLOGY 
VL-yalgea06 2670.50 2671.94 s0001 A FAX THE WORLD 
VL-yalgea06 2671.95 2673.68 s0001 OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE CAN ONLY EAT 
VL-yalgea06 2673.69 2674.95 s0001 WHAT'S BEING PRODUCED 
VL-yalgea06 2674.95 2676.64 s0001 EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING PRODUCED 
VL-yalgea06 2676.66 2681.89 s0001 IS PART OF SOMEBODY'S ENDOWMENTS A NEW TECHNOLOGY OF MISTER A INVENTS A NEW TECHNOLOGY 
VL-yalgea06 2681.90 2684.55 s0001 HE GIVES UP SOME OF HIS GOOD A TIME ONE 
VL-yalgea06 2684.56 2688.06 s0001 TO GET MORE THE GOOD A TIME TO SOW HIS ENDOWMENT HAS CHANGED 
VL-yalgea06 2688.06 2690.53 s0001 HE'S GOT A NEW ENDOWMENT BUT IT STILL HAS ENDOWMENT 
VL-yalgea06 2690.54 2692.81 s0001 SO WHATEVER THE NEW ALLOCATION IS 
VL-yalgea06 2692.82 2697.37 s0001 IT HAS TO ADD UP TO THE NEW ENDOWMENT I HAVEN'T EVEN BOTHER TO WRITE DOWN THE NEW ENDOWMENT 
VL-yalgea06 2697.90 2701.24 s0001 I KNOW THE VALUE OF THAT NEW ENDOWMENT WHATEVER IT IS 
VL-yalgea06 2701.25 2703.50 s0001 IS GOING TO BE LESS THAN THE VALUE 
VL-yalgea06 2703.51 2706.58 s0001 OF THE OLD ENDOWMENT AND TECHNOLOGY LOSES MONEY 
VL-yalgea06 2707.16 2710.25 s0001 OKAY SO THE CONTRADICTION IS 
VL-yalgea06 2710.26 2711.88 s0001 THE VALUE OF THE NEW 
VL-yalgea06 2711.89 2714.83 s0001 ENDOWMENT AFTER THE TECHNOLOGIES USED 
VL-yalgea06 2714.88 2719.42 s0001 AT THE OLD EQUILIBRIUM PRICES IS LOWER THAN THE VALUE OF THE OLD ENDOWMENT 
VL-yalgea06 2719.43 2721.49 s0001 AT THE OLD EQUILIBRIUM PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 2721.50 2722.69 s0001 BUT THAT'S 
VL-yalgea06 2722.70 2724.27 s0001 SINCE IT'S TRUE FOR EVERY PERSON 
VL-yalgea06 2724.28 2725.32 s0001 IN THE AGGREGATE 
VL-yalgea06 2725.33 2726.39 s0001 THAT'S LESS 
VL-yalgea06 2726.40 2729.50 s0001 THE VALUE OF THIS NEW REGIME CONSUMPTION 
VL-yalgea06 2729.52 2733.32 s0001 AND THAT'S A CONTRADICTION BECAUSE THE NEW REGIME CONSUMPTION 
VL-yalgea06 2733.33 2734.57 s0001 THAT'S ALL THIS STUFF 
VL-yalgea06 2734.58 2735.92 s0001 PAST THE WALL 
VL-yalgea06 2735.93 2737.35 s0001 EXACTLY THE TOTAL 
VL-yalgea06 2737.36 2739.32 s0001 ENDOWMENTS THE ECONOMY TO BEGIN WITH 
VL-yalgea06 2739.33 2740.82 s0001 THAT'S THE CONTRADICTION 
VL-yalgea06 2740.83 2745.68 s0001 OKAY SO YOU CAN'T MAKE EVERYBODY BETTER OFF THAT SIMPLE ARGUMENT WHICH AS I SAID 
VL-yalgea06 2746.64 2753.83 s0001 MY ADVISER CAN ARROW ANOTHER GUARD YEMEN GEORGIA BREW BALTIMORE WORKING AT THE CALLS FOUNDATION WHICH IS PART OF THE OF THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2753.84 2755.11 s0001 PROOF THAT THEY GAVE 
VL-yalgea06 2755.11 2756.36 s0001 MOST IMPORTANT 
VL-yalgea06 2756.37 2759.57 s0001 SIMPLEST THE MOST IMPORTANT ARGUMENT ALL OF ECONOMICS 
VL-yalgea06 2759.58 2760.99 s0001 OKAY SO WE 
VL-yalgea06 2760.99 2762.83 s0001 GET IS A CONCLUSION 
VL-yalgea06 2762.84 2765.09 s0001 THAT'S PUTTING IT ANOTHER WAY 
VL-yalgea06 2765.09 2767.63 s0001 THAT UM OWNERS 
VL-yalgea06 2767.64 2769.44 s0001 OWNERS OF SURE OF 
VL-yalgea06 2769.44 2770.51 s0001 ALL NUMBERS 
VL-yalgea06 2770.52 2771.91 s0001 FARMS 
VL-yalgea06 2772.80 2774.54 s0001 SURE 
VL-yalgea06 2774.82 2776.83 s0001 MAXIMISE 
VL-yalgea06 2778.21 2783.63 s0001 SHARE THE VALUE OF THEIR FIRMS' THE VALUE OF THE STOCK MARKET VALUE 
VL-yalgea06 2787.17 2788.91 s0001 VALUE 
VL-yalgea06 2788.91 2790.91 s0001 OF THEIR FARMS 
VL-yalgea06 2794.52 2807.27 s0001 AND THANK GOD THEY DO BECAUSE IF THEY FIND SOME NEURAL NEW WAY OF PRODUCING THAT'S GOING TO LOSE MONEY IS GOING TO MAKE THE STOCK MARKET VALUE GO DOWN REMEMBER THE STOCK MARKET VALUES JUST THE SAME CALCULATION THE VALUE OF ALL THE OUTPUT THEY'RE PRODUCING 
VL-yalgea06 2807.28 2810.31 s0001 IF THEY FIND SOME WAY OF LOSING MONEY AND THEY TRY TO USE IT 
VL-yalgea06 2810.32 2813.79 s0001 IT'LL MAKE THEIR STOCK MARKET VALUE GO DOWN THAT'S WHY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO WHAT 
VL-yalgea06 2813.80 2815.93 s0001 AND THANKS THANK GOD FOR THAT BECAUSE 
VL-yalgea06 2815.93 2818.74 s0001 IT BE A BAD THING FOR SOCIETY AS THEY DID DO IT 
VL-yalgea06 2837.27 2841.62 s0001 OKAY HE'S VERY BOLD QUESTION TELLING ME THAT AS A FLOOD PROOF AND 
VL-yalgea06 2841.63 2843.56 s0001 I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR 
VL-yalgea06 2843.56 2845.25 s0001 COURAGE ARM 
VL-yalgea06 2845.25 2850.59 s0001 AS IT HAPPENS HOWEVER A YOU'VE ASKED THE SAME QUESTION THAT SOMEBODY ASKED 
VL-yalgea06 2850.59 2852.83 s0001 CLASS OR TWO WHICH IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION 
VL-yalgea06 2852.84 2853.88 s0001 AH 
VL-yalgea06 2853.89 2856.57 s0001 SO THE ANSWER IS NO LIFE SHOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED 
VL-yalgea06 2856.58 2859.39 s0001 PRICES AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT TO PROVE 
VL-yalgea06 2859.63 2864.05 s0001 OH YES IT'S TRUE THAT AFTER THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES INTRODUCED 
VL-yalgea06 2864.05 2866.85 s0001 THE PRICES CHANGE EVERYTHING CHANGES 
VL-yalgea06 2866.85 2871.01 s0001 BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ALL THAT COMPLICATION AFTER ALL THE CHANGES 
VL-yalgea06 2871.02 2874.01 s0001 THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME FINAL ALLOCATION OF GOODS 
VL-yalgea06 2874.02 2876.29 s0001 THAT SUPPOSEDLY MAKES EVERYBODY BETTER OFF 
VL-yalgea06 2876.30 2879.16 s0001 SO I CAN ASK A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION 
VL-yalgea06 2879.43 2885.05 s0001 WITH THIS NEW ALLOCATION TO A AT THE OLD PRICES BE SOMETHING HE COULD HAVE AFFORDED 
VL-yalgea06 2885.06 2886.97 s0001 AND THE ANSWER MUST BE NO 
VL-yalgea06 2886.98 2891.75 s0001 WELL I JUST FINISHED YOUR SEE THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT I'M GOING TO SAY THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION 
VL-yalgea06 2891.76 2896.88 s0001 SO AT THE SOAP IT'S THE PROOF IS CLEVER PRECISELY BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING 
VL-yalgea06 2896.89 2899.28 s0001 YOU YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF 
VL-yalgea06 2899.29 2903.24 s0001 YOU HAVE THIS NEW ECONOMY IN NEW ALLOCATION OF NEW PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 2903.25 2904.29 s0001 BUT THE PROOF 
VL-yalgea06 2904.30 2909.90 s0001 SAYS LET'S DO THE HYPOTHETICAL UP THING OF LOOKING AT THE NEW ALLOCATION AT THE OLD PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 2909.91 2912.17 s0001 AT THE OLD PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 2912.28 2918.70 s0001 KEEP AID COULDN'T HAVE AFFORDED THIS NEW ALLOCATION THAT'S BECAUSE WE COULD WE WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM BETTER OFF 
VL-yalgea06 2918.71 2923.20 s0001 SO THE OLD PRICES EIGHT COULD HAVE AFFORDED THIS NEW REGIME ALLOCATION 
VL-yalgea06 2923.21 2925.57 s0001 SIMILARLY BE AT THE OLD PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 2925.58 2928.05 s0001 COULDN'T AFFORD THIS NEW REGIME ALLOCATION 
VL-yalgea06 2928.06 2935.79 s0001 OKAY SO AT THE OLD PRICES EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE TO BE SPENDING MORE ON THE NEW REGIME ALLOCATION THAN THE VALUE OF THEIR ENDOWMENT 
VL-yalgea06 2935.80 2937.90 s0001 THAT MEANS THAT THE OLD PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 2937.90 2941.11 s0001 THE TOTAL IN THE WHOLE SOCIETY BY ADDING IT UP 
VL-yalgea06 2941.12 2944.70 s0001 OF THOSE EXPENDITURES ON THE NEW REGIME CONSUMPTION THIS 
VL-yalgea06 2944.71 2947.11 s0001 MUST BE BIGGER THAN THE TOTAL VALUE 
VL-yalgea06 2947.12 2948.18 s0001 O. V. 
VL-yalgea06 2948.19 2949.36 s0001 OLD ENDOWMENTS 
VL-yalgea06 2949.37 2955.57 s0001 NOW THAT WAS THE CONTRADICTION WYATT THE OLD ENDOWMENTS WITHOUT PRODUCTION YOU COULDN'T MAKE EVERYBODY BETTER OFF WE ALREADY HAVE A CONTRADICTION 
VL-yalgea06 2955.58 2957.07 s0001 NOW WE HAD ONE MORE STEP 
VL-yalgea06 2957.08 2959.67 s0001 WE'VE GOT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT CHANGED 
VL-yalgea06 2959.68 2961.10 s0001 THE OLD EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 2961.10 2964.01 s0001 ENDOWMENT THE OLD ENDOWMENTS TO CHANGE THE OLD ENDOWMENTS 
VL-yalgea06 2964.02 2966.94 s0001 BUT HOWEVER CHANGE THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW I DID IT 
VL-yalgea06 2966.95 2970.31 s0001 IT MADE THE VALUE OF THE TOTAL INTIMATE EVEN LAST THAT WAS BEFORE 
VL-yalgea06 2970.32 2972.50 s0001 SO ACTUALLY GET A WORST CONTRADICTION THAN BEFORE 
VL-yalgea06 2972.51 2974.69 s0001 THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2977.18 2979.25 s0001 OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS 
VL-yalgea06 2982.15 2985.38 s0001 YES I CAN RAISE WHICH BOARD NOT THIS ONE 
VL-yalgea06 2985.70 2987.12 s0001 YEAH WELL 
VL-yalgea06 2987.13 2988.55 s0001 THE DIFFERENCE WITH 
VL-yalgea06 2992.04 2993.78 s0001 SO 
VL-yalgea06 2994.14 2996.57 s0001 THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS 
VL-yalgea06 2996.57 2997.83 s0001 THAT 
VL-yalgea06 2997.84 2999.43 s0001 LET ME JUST SUMMARISE 
VL-yalgea06 2999.44 3003.19 s0001 WE SPENT YOU KNOW FOR CLASSES UNREVEALING 
VL-yalgea06 3003.19 3004.35 s0001 STANDARD 
VL-yalgea06 3004.36 3006.07 s0001 INTERMEDIATE MICRO AND MACRO 
VL-yalgea06 3006.07 3008.40 s0001 PEOPLE NEVER TALK ABOUT THAT STUFF 
VL-yalgea06 3008.40 3009.47 s0001 WHEN THEY DO 
VL-yalgea06 3009.48 3011.28 s0001 FINANCIAL FINANCE COURSES 
VL-yalgea06 3011.29 3012.56 s0001 TYPICAL COURSES 
VL-yalgea06 3012.56 3015.96 s0001 HOWEVER IRVING FISHER THE INVENTOR OF HALF OF FINANCE 
VL-yalgea06 3015.97 3017.29 s0001 THAT'S HOW HE BEGAN 
VL-yalgea06 3017.30 3020.01 s0001 IT'S GOING TO TURN OUT NOW ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THIS LAST 
VL-yalgea06 3020.02 3022.78 s0001 CRISIS THAT THE BEST WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON 
VL-yalgea06 3022.79 3027.39 s0001 IS TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL UNDERLYING ECONOMY SO FISHER SAID YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE 
VL-yalgea06 3027.39 3032.58 s0001 WE HAVE AN INTRODUCE RISK BY THE WAY WHEN THAT HAPPENS THINGS ARE MORE COMPLICATED FISHER COULDN'T DEAL WITH RISK 
VL-yalgea06 3032.59 3037.07 s0001 SO WITHOUT RISK WHERE EVERYBODY'S ANTICIPATING THE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea06 3037.07 3040.92 s0001 THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS REDUCE FINANCIAL ECONOMY UP THERE 
VL-yalgea06 3040.93 3042.41 s0001 TO A GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 3042.43 3043.85 s0001 WHICH YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT 
VL-yalgea06 3043.86 3046.80 s0001 BEFORE YOU GOT TO THIS COURSE MOST OF YOU HOW TO SOLVE 
VL-yalgea06 3046.80 3052.86 s0001 AND NOW THAT SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM WITH MARGINAL UTILITY AND GREATER EFFICIENCY THAT TELLS ENORMOUS AMOUNT 
VL-yalgea06 3052.87 3055.50 s0001 ABOUT HOW THE STOCK MARKET AND EVERYTHING WORKS 
VL-yalgea06 3055.51 3058.22 s0001 IT TELLS US THAT THE VALUE OF EVERY STOCK 
VL-yalgea06 3058.23 3062.60 s0001 IS JUST THE DISCOUNTED REAL THEN THE TINS DISCOUNT THE WHEEL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 3062.61 3065.06 s0001 OR THE DISCOUNTED NOMINAL 
VL-yalgea06 3065.06 3067.05 s0001 PAYOFFS CASH FLOWS 
VL-yalgea06 3067.06 3069.37 s0001 DISCOUNTED THE NOMINAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 3069.37 3074.08 s0001 AND IT TELLS US THAT THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST IS THE NOMINAL RATE DIVIDED BY 
VL-yalgea06 3074.09 3075.49 s0001 THE RATE OF INFLATION 
VL-yalgea06 3075.49 3082.91 s0001 OKAY AND IT TELLS US THAT'S A GOOD THING ALL THESE OWNERS OF COMPANIES ARE MAXIMISING PROFITS OR SHARE VALUE WHICH IS THE SAME THING 
VL-yalgea06 3082.93 3085.01 s0001 AND THAT'S HELPING SOCIETY 
VL-yalgea06 3085.02 3086.77 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S THE FISHER 
VL-yalgea06 3086.78 3090.64 s0001 THAT'S THE LESSON A LOT OF THAT STUFF IS GOING TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT BUT THAT'S THE BASIC 
VL-yalgea06 3090.64 3091.72 s0001 IDEA 
VL-yalgea06 3091.73 3094.30 s0001 SO FINALLY LET'S GET TO THE POINT 
VL-yalgea06 3094.31 3095.56 s0001 THE THE 
VL-yalgea06 3095.57 3097.62 s0001 FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
VL-yalgea06 3097.62 3100.47 s0001 THE PUBLIC WAS CONFUSED ABOUT INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 3100.48 3107.56 s0001 THEY SAID ARISTOTLE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE GREATEST GENIUSES OF ALL TIME HE THOUGHT INTEREST WAS A NOT UNNATURAL ACT IT WAS HORRIBLE 
VL-yalgea06 3107.56 3112.21 s0001 OKAY EVEN OF COURSE EVERY LOTS OF PEOPLE IN GREECE WERE CHARGING INTEREST IN THE YOU KNOW THE THE 
VL-yalgea06 3112.21 3115.64 s0001 THE D. LOSS OF THE DELPHI ORACLE 
VL-yalgea06 3115.64 3125.53 s0001 WAS CHARGING INTEREST WOULD LEND MONEYED INTERESTS AND YOU KNOW ARISTOTLE EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT THE DOG OR GO ALL THE TIME THEY WANT EVEN PAYING ATTENTION TO DO BUT WORK WAS CHARGING INTEREST AND THEY WERE SAYING IT'S TOTALLY UNNATURAL 
VL-yalgea06 3125.54 3127.52 s0001 OKAY SO UM 
VL-yalgea06 3127.53 3130.89 s0001 THREE RELIGIONS ALL THOUGHT INTEREST WAS A TERRIBLE THING 
VL-yalgea06 3130.90 3132.25 s0001 THEY ALL THOUGHT THAT IT WAS 
VL-yalgea06 3132.26 3135.82 s0001 THE OTHER SHOULD BE THE JUST PRICE WAS THE NOMINAL RATE A MENTION SHOULD BE ZERO 
VL-yalgea06 3135.82 3139.02 s0001 BUT WHAT FISHER SAYS IS THE NOMINAL RATE OF INTEREST IS IRRELEVANT 
VL-yalgea06 3139.03 3141.58 s0001 NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE NOMINAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 3141.59 3146.36 s0001 THEY LOOK AT APPLE'S TODAY AND APPLES NEXT YEAR THE MONEY AND STUFF JUST GETS IN THE WAY 
VL-yalgea06 3146.37 3149.17 s0001 IT'S THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST THAT YOU CARE ABOUT 
VL-yalgea06 3149.17 3151.28 s0001 AND THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 3151.28 3154.93 s0001 DOESN'T HAVE TO BE POSITIVE IT COULD BE NEGATIVE LIKE IT IS TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 3154.93 3156.71 s0001 BUT THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 3156.71 3158.60 s0001 UM HE SAYS 
VL-yalgea06 3158.61 3160.53 s0001 IS DUE TO THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 3160.54 3165.60 s0001 WHAT ARE THE DETERMINANTS USUALLY OF THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISN'T KNOCKING AROUND WITH THINGS 
VL-yalgea06 3165.61 3166.91 s0001 THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 3166.92 3171.94 s0001 IS OBTAINED BY SOLVING FOR P. ONE AND P. TWO IN THIS GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM MODEL 
VL-yalgea06 3171.95 3176.33 s0001 OKAY SO WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 3176.34 3179.30 s0001 ALL YOU HAVE THE UTILITIES AND THE ENDOWMENTS 
VL-yalgea06 3179.30 3181.62 s0001 OKAY SO HERE'S THE ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea06 3181.63 3185.27 s0001 WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST SO THE FIRST THING FISHER SAYS 
VL-yalgea06 3185.27 3186.88 s0001 IS IN PATIENTS 
VL-yalgea06 3187.54 3193.83 s0001 SO IN FACT HE'S ONE WAS WAS FAMOUS ARTICLE WAS CALLED AN IMPATIENCE THEORY VENTURES SO LET'S CALL IT THAT 
VL-yalgea06 3193.84 3196.12 s0001 PATIENTS THEORY ADVENTURES 
VL-yalgea06 3196.12 3197.83 s0001 SO FISHER SAID 
VL-yalgea06 3197.84 3200.43 s0001 THAT IN HIS VIEW PEOPLE ARE IMPATIENT 
VL-yalgea06 3200.44 3205.46 s0001 WHY THAT MEANS AN APPLE TODAY THEY THOUGHT WAS MORE VALUABLE THAN APPLE NEXT YEAR WHY 
VL-yalgea06 3205.47 3206.70 s0001 BECAUSE OF THE 
VL-yalgea06 3206.71 3208.76 s0001 POOR IMAGINATION 
VL-yalgea06 3209.11 3211.24 s0001 YOU KNOW IT'S EASY TO 
VL-yalgea06 3211.31 3213.67 s0001 THINK ABOUT EATING APPLE TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 3213.68 3216.45 s0001 YOU COULD JUST HOLD IN YOUR HAND AND YOU'RE SO CLOSE 
VL-yalgea06 3216.46 3221.22 s0001 BUT THE THING ABOUT EATING OF THE YEAR REQUIRE SOME IMAGINATION AND POOR IMAGINATION 
VL-yalgea06 3221.22 3224.31 s0001 AND SECONDLY THE SECOND MAIN REASON AS THEY YOU KNOW OF A 
VL-yalgea06 3224.32 3225.93 s0001 MORTALITY THEY MIGHT 
VL-yalgea06 3225.94 3228.40 s0001 DIED BETWEEN TODAY NEXT YEAR 
VL-yalgea06 3230.43 3236.70 s0001 OKAY SO THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN REASONS HE GIVES A BUNCH OF OTHER GERMAN DIMENSION SHORTLY BUT THESE ARE THE TWO MOST INTERESTING ONES 
VL-yalgea06 3236.70 3242.91 s0001 POVERTY OF IMAGINATION THE FACT USERS MIGHT DIE IN BETWEEN SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAN APPLE NEXT YEAR'S NOT A SURE THING 
VL-yalgea06 3242.92 3245.11 s0001 OKAY THIS IMPATIENCE THEORY VENTURES 
VL-yalgea06 3245.12 3246.30 s0001 SO HE SAID 
VL-yalgea06 3246.31 3249.70 s0001 THAT'S WHY IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE THIS GUY 
VL-yalgea06 3249.71 3253.24 s0001 A IS IMPATIENT BECAUSE HE VALUES THE APPLE TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 3253.25 3256.56 s0001 MORE THAN A VALUE TOMORROW HE'S GOT THIS DISCOUNT RATE 
VL-yalgea06 3256.57 3257.61 s0001 A HALF HERE 
VL-yalgea06 3257.62 3260.42 s0001 THESE NOT IMPATIENT BECAUSE THE DISCOUNT FACTOR 
VL-yalgea06 3260.43 3261.62 s0001 IS JUAN 
VL-yalgea06 3261.64 3264.50 s0001 OKAY SO HE PUT A DISCOUNT FACTOR 
VL-yalgea06 3266.20 3271.18 s0001 ACTUALLY FISHER DIDN'T QUITE HAVE A DISCOUNT FACTOR IN A MORE GENERAL THING SO SAMSON 
VL-yalgea06 3271.18 3274.76 s0001 HE'S THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED THE DISCOUNT FACTOR 
VL-yalgea06 3275.09 3283.31 s0001 OF MATTER BUT A WAY SO A DISCOUNT FACTOR TO CAPTURE FISHERS IDEA THAT THE GOOD NEXT YEAR'S NOT IS WORTH THE SAME APPLE NEXT YEAR'S NOT WORTH AS MUCH 
VL-yalgea06 3283.32 3285.21 s0001 A IS AN APPLE THIS YEAR 
VL-yalgea06 3285.21 3287.83 s0001 OKAY SO SUPPOSE A CHANGE A HALF 
VL-yalgea06 3287.84 3288.98 s0001 TWO

VL-yalgea06 3404.02 3410.25 s0001 WAY TO GET THESE TO ADD UP TO ONE I TAKE ONE PLUS DELTA SO THE WEIGHT ON THIS THING IS ONE OF ONE PLUS DELTA 
VL-yalgea06 3410.26 3412.59 s0001 TIMES THIS DIVIDED BY TEAM ON 
VL-yalgea06 3412.59 3414.82 s0001 SO P. ONE IS ONE 
VL-yalgea06 3415.71 3417.87 s0001 THAT PAINTING WAS ONE

VL-yalgea06 3438.84 3441.45 s0001 P. ONE IS PAID SOMETHING TO EQUALS ONE 
VL-yalgea06 3441.46 3448.36 s0001 SO IF I DIVIDE BY P. ONE P. WHATEVER P. ONE GOES AWAY NINE P. TWO OVER P. ONE AND P. TWO IS ONE THAT WAS WARMER P. ONE 
VL-yalgea06 3448.37 3450.56 s0001 SO OBVIOUSLY IS P. ONE GOES UP 
VL-yalgea06 3450.57 3454.65 s0001 YOUR DEMAND GOES DOWN THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU'D EXPECT SOAPY ONE GOES UP 
VL-yalgea06 3454.66 3459.21 s0001 HE WON GOES DOWN THE DEMAND GOES UP OR P. ONE GOES UP THE DEMAND GOES DOWN

VL-yalgea06 3469.82 3471.85 s0001 SO IF YOU CHANGE DELTA 
VL-yalgea06 3471.90 3474.53 s0001 IF YOU MAKE DELTA SMALLER 
VL-yalgea06 3474.54 3478.38 s0001 THAT'S GOING TO RAISE DEMAND FOR A WANTED THE OLD PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 3478.39 3479.83 s0001 WHY 
VL-yalgea06 3480.77 3486.51 s0001 AT ALL EQUILIBRIUM PRICES THE SAME TRICK AS BEFORE AN OLD EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 3486.52 3487.86 s0001 PRICES

VL-yalgea06 3499.84 3500.88 s0001 GOES UP 
VL-yalgea06 3500.89 3503.60 s0001 OKAY SO THERE'S THE GUYS DEMANDING MORE NOW

VL-yalgea06 3512.09 3513.83 s0001 AIMS TO 
VL-yalgea06 3515.62 3521.73 s0001 OKAY SO THE OLD EQUILIBRIUM PRICES IS DEMANDING MORE THE ONLY WAY TO CLEAR THE MARKET IS TO RAISE P. ONE 
VL-yalgea06 3521.74 3522.95 s0001 IMPLIES 
VL-yalgea06 3522.97 3524.10 s0001 P. ONE 
VL-yalgea06 3524.12 3526.45 s0001 MUST GO UP TO CLEAR THE MARKET 
VL-yalgea06 3526.45 3528.64 s0001 THIS IS A FORMAL PROOF 
VL-yalgea06 3528.65 3532.10 s0001 OF WHAT HE JUST SAID SO THE COMMON SENSE MAYBE IS ENOUGH FOR YOU 
VL-yalgea06 3532.11 3537.12 s0001 IF YOU CARE LESS ABOUT THE FUTURE TO GET ANYBODY TO SAVE A GRAPH TO RAISE THE INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea06 3537.13 3539.92 s0001 THE SAVE FORMALLY IF YOU WE SAW FOR EQUILIBRIUM 
VL-yalgea06 3539.93 3541.39 s0001 WITH A LOWER DELTA 
VL-yalgea06 3541.40 3543.50 s0001 AT THE ALDE EQUILIBRIUM PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 3543.51 3548.58 s0001 THIS GUY AT THE OLD PRICES A WOULD NOW SHIFT IN BY TRY TO DEMAND WARM GOOD ONE 
VL-yalgea06 3548.59 3550.77 s0001 BUT HE DEMANDED MORE OF GOOD ONE 
VL-yalgea06 3550.77 3556.65 s0001 THAT WOULD MEAN TOO MUCH DEMAND FOR GOOD ONE THE ONLY WAY TO CLEAR THE PRICE OF GOOD ONE IS TO RAISE THE PRICE P. ONE 
VL-yalgea06 3556.66 3559.24 s0001 BUT IF YOU RAISE P. WANNA HOLDING PEOPLE TO FAXED 
VL-yalgea06 3559.25 3563.08 s0001 THAT'S JUST P. WANT TO REVIEW TO THOSE LOW INTEREST RATES OF THE INDUSTRY HAS TO GO UP 
VL-yalgea06 3563.08 3565.72 s0001 SO IT'S YOUR ARGUMENT MADE FORMAL 
VL-yalgea06 3566.33 3572.00 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S HIS IMPATIENCE DAVID THAT'S THE MAIN DETERMINANT OF INTEREST ACCORDING TO FISHER 
VL-yalgea06 3572.00 3573.78 s0001 WHAT'S THE SECOND ONE 
VL-yalgea06 3573.84 3576.06 s0001 OKAY HE SAYS SUPPOSE

VL-yalgea06 3619.64 3622.64 s0001 SAVE LESS FORD IS A MORE 
VL-yalgea06 3626.17 3632.54 s0001 SO LET'S THINK OF A GOOD X. WANTED PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY'RE GOING TO BE RICHER AT THE OLD PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 3632.55 3634.70 s0001 WHAT WOULD THEY DO TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 3634.71 3636.64 s0001 FOREX ONE DEMAND MORE OR LESS 
VL-yalgea06 3636.65 3638.05 s0001 TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 3638.38 3639.87 s0001 SO

VL-yalgea06 3660.14 3662.76 s0001 THE POINT IS THERE'S GOING TO BE SO MUCH STUFF 
VL-yalgea06 3662.77 3665.27 s0001 AROUND FOR PEOPLE TO EAT TOMORROW 
VL-yalgea06 3665.28 3667.00 s0001 YOU'VE GOT TO GET THEM 
VL-yalgea06 3667.01 3673.83 s0001 TO WANT TO EAT ALL THAT EXTRA STUFF TO MARS YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM INCENTIVE TO WANT TO EAT ALL THAT EXTRA STUFF TO MY HOUSE IF THEY RAISE THE 
VL-yalgea06 3673.84 3677.15 s0001 RAISE THE INTEREST RATE NOT LORE OF THE REGULAR ONE CONCLUSION 
VL-yalgea06 3677.16 3681.30 s0001 NOW HOW CAN YOU ACTUALLY GIVE A FORMAL PROOF OR THAT'S YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT CONFUSED 
VL-yalgea06 3681.31 3685.79 s0001 AGAIN LIKE HIS QUESTIONS WE ASKED THEM OKAY AT THE OLD PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 3685.80 3688.42 s0001 WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE DEMAND FOR X. ONE 
VL-yalgea06 3688.43 3690.46 s0001 AT THE ALL PRICES 
VL-yalgea06 3690.47 3696.45 s0001 SINCE YOU'RE GONNA BE SO RICH IN THE FUTURE YOU THINK YOU'RE JUST INCREDIBLY RICH NOW SO OF COURSE WE GOING TO CONSUME MORE TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 3696.46 3698.39 s0001 SO THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE DEMAND 
VL-yalgea06 3698.39 3703.68 s0001 TODAY AND THE ENDOWMENT TODAY HASN'T CHANGED SO THAT ANYMORE DEMANDED A WITH THE SAME ENDOWMENT TODAY 
VL-yalgea06 3703.68 3705.03 s0001 SO THEREFORE 
VL-yalgea06 3705.03 3711.65 s0001 A IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE MARKET TODAY YOU'D HAVE TO RAISE P. ONE RELATIVE TO P. TWO OF THE INTEREST RATES GOING TO GO UP 
VL-yalgea06 3711.65 3713.31 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 3713.96 3715.43 s0001 IT'S NOT CLEAR 
VL-yalgea06 3715.43 3718.46 s0001 THAT IT'S A LITTLE SURPRISING OKAY BUT 
VL-yalgea06 3718.46 3720.64 s0001 SO LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN IF YOU

VL-yalgea06 3746.00 3751.19 s0001 AND SO THEREFORE IN ORDER TO CLEAR TODAY'S MARKET WITH THE SUPPLY ISN'T CHANGES ALL THESE PEOPLE CHINA 
VL-yalgea06 3751.19 3756.69 s0001 EAT MORE TODAY HAVE TO RAISE TODAY'S PRICE RELEVANT AMAR THAT'S RAISE THE REAL INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea06 3756.70 3759.24 s0001 OKAY SO WHAT'S THE THIRD

VL-yalgea06 3774.72 3776.45 s0001 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN 
VL-yalgea06 3781.54 3783.39 s0001 OKAY WE HAVE TO MAKE 
VL-yalgea06 3783.66 3785.53 s0001 AN EXTRA ASSUMPTION HERE 
VL-yalgea06 3785.54 3789.32 s0001 FISHER FELT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RICH WERE RICH BECAUSE THEY WERE PATIENT 
VL-yalgea06 3789.33 3793.07 s0001 OKAY THEY COULD CHARGE INTERESTING GET LOTS OF MONEY SO IF YOU CHANGE 
VL-yalgea06 3793.08 3798.43 s0001 YOU CHANGE WELL IF YOU TAKE AWAY SOME MONEY FROM THE POOR THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY OVER THE LAST 
VL-yalgea06 3798.44 3799.52 s0001 YOU KNOW 
VL-yalgea06 3799.53 3801.05 s0001 FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS 
VL-yalgea06 3801.06 3810.27 s0001 THE RICH GOT RICHER AND THE POOR ARE PRETTY MUCH BACK WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE SO SUPPOSE THE RICH GET RICH AT THE EXPENSE OF THE POOR WHAT'S GONNA THAT DUE TO THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 3812.40 3815.40 s0001 OKAY ALL HANG ON A SECOND HE YUP 
VL-yalgea06 3815.87 3818.47 s0001 THAT'S GOING TO LOWER WHY IS THAT 
VL-yalgea06 3824.26 3829.04 s0001 OKAY SO YOU THERE'S AN INTUITIVE WAY OF SAYING IT WHICH IS HIS WHICH IS THAT 
VL-yalgea06 3829.05 3833.40 s0001 THE AH THE RICH BECAUSE THEIR PATIENT ARE PROBABLY THE LENDERS 
VL-yalgea06 3833.41 3835.71 s0001 NOW THEY'RE EVEN MORE WILLING TO LAND 
VL-yalgea06 3835.71 3840.53 s0001 AND SO THE INTEREST RATE HAS TO UH GO DOWN TO GET THESE OTHER PEOPLE THE WORLD 
VL-yalgea06 3840.53 3843.11 s0001 OKAY OR A FORMAL WAY OF SAYING IT 
VL-yalgea06 3843.11 3846.89 s0001 IS THAT IF YOU TRANSFER MONEY FROM THE RICH TO THE POOR 
VL-yalgea06 3846.89 3848.54 s0001 OKAY THAT MEANS 
VL-yalgea06 3848.55 3851.75 s0001 BE A POOR GUYS BECAUSE 
VL-yalgea06 3852.29 3853.99 s0001 SO THE WEALTH 
VL-yalgea06 3854.00 3857.80 s0001 THE THE RICH GUYS ALWAYS CONSUME A HIGHER PROPORTION 
VL-yalgea06 3857.81 3862.07 s0001 IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE PATIENT SO MORE PATIENT GUY WILL CONSUME MORE IN THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea06 3862.07 3863.71 s0001 TO TAKE AWAY WELL FROM AN 
VL-yalgea06 3863.71 3866.72 s0001 FROM AN IMPATIENT GUY AND GIVE IT TO A PATIENT GUY 
VL-yalgea06 3866.72 3867.77 s0001 YOU'RE GOING TO 
VL-yalgea06 3867.78 3868.87 s0001 INCREASE 
VL-yalgea06 3868.87 3870.29 s0001 UM 
VL-yalgea06 3870.56 3872.79 s0001 THE AH 
VL-yalgea06 3875.66 3878.70 s0001 YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MORE THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE 
VL-yalgea06 3878.71 3882.40 s0001 MORE IN THE HANDS OF THE PATIENT PEOPLE AND SO THE PATIENT PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea06 3882.40 3889.77 s0001 THAT YOU'RE THE MAKES IS GOING TO CHANGE PEOPLE ON AVERAGE ARE MORE PATIENT AND THEY WERE BEFORE SO ON AVERAGE IN THE ECONOMY OR CAN WE CONSUME LESS THAN THEY WERE 
VL-yalgea06 3889.78 3893.46 s0001 OF TODAY'S GOODS AND SO THE SHIFT IS GOING TO BE IN THIS DIRECTION 
VL-yalgea06 3893.46 3896.06 s0001 BECAUSE YOU'VE TAKEN HUMANE PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea06 3896.07 3898.43 s0001 LOT OF THEM IMPATIENT A LOT OF PATIENT 
VL-yalgea06 3898.44 3903.91 s0001 YOU INCREASE THE PATIENT ONES AND INCREASED THE IMPATIENT ONES SO ON BALANCE YOU CAN INCREASE 
VL-yalgea06 3903.91 3910.12 s0001 ARE YOU GOING TO DECREASE DEMAND TODAY WAS THE IMPATIENT ONES WHO WANTED TO EAT TODAY IN THE OTHER GUYS ARE WILLING TO WAIT NOW 
VL-yalgea06 3910.13 3918.12 s0001 NOW THE GUYS WHO ARE WILLING TO WAIT THESE GUYS DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY ARE THE ONES DOING OTHER CONSUMING TODAY AND NOW THEY'RE NOT DON'T CAN'T AFFORD TO DO MUCH CONSUMING 
VL-yalgea06 3918.13 3923.33 s0001 YOU CAN REDUCE CONSUMPTION TODAY SO TO GET THE MARKET THE CLEAR AGAIN YOU HAVE TO LOWER THE INTEREST RATE THIS TIME 
VL-yalgea06 3923.34 3926.86 s0001 OKAY SO THOSE THREE FAMOUS CONCLUSIONS OF FISHER 
VL-yalgea06 3926.87 3928.58 s0001 MORE IMPATIENT PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea06 3928.60 3930.12 s0001 HIGHER INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea06 3930.13 3933.83 s0001 MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE HIGHER INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea06 3933.91 3937.72 s0001 TRANSFERS FROM THE POOR TO THE RICH LOWER INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea06 3937.73 3945.38 s0001 OKAY SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THE STOCK MARKET IN THIS CASE SUPPOSE PEOPLE ARE MORE IMPATIENT AS THE STOCK MARKET GO UP OR DOWN 
VL-yalgea06 3950.75 3953.23 s0001 DOWN BECAUSE THE STOCK MARKET 
VL-yalgea06 3953.23 3954.36 s0001 PRICE 
VL-yalgea06 3954.37 3955.80 s0001 IS JUST 
VL-yalgea06 3956.16 3957.87 s0001 YES 
VL-yalgea06 3957.87 3966.10 s0001 THE REAL INTEREST RATE TIMES THE NETHERLANDS I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU THAT THE EVIDENCE CHANGED SO THE DIVIDENDS OF THE SAME THEY WILL INTEREST RATES GONE UP THE STOCK MARKET'S GONE DOWN 
VL-yalgea06 3966.10 3967.72 s0001 SO WHAT HAPPENS IF 
VL-yalgea06 3967.72 3970.68 s0001 A ROW OF IMPATIENCE 
VL-yalgea06 3970.69 3973.85 s0001 SUPPOSE PEOPLE MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea06 3975.01 3979.32 s0001 SO NOT ABOUT THE STOCKS PRODUCING MORE BUT ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S MORE 
VL-yalgea06 3979.33 3982.76 s0001 STUFF IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW THEY'RE KNOWN ENDOWMENTS WILL BE BIGGER 
VL-yalgea06 3982.99 3987.24 s0001 THE STOCK MARKET'S GOING TO GO DOWN I'LL GET AROUND A LITTLE SUBTLER BECAUSE THEY COULD BE 
VL-yalgea06 3987.25 3991.77 s0001 THEY COULD BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE STOCK PRICES ABOUT THE STOCKS PRODUCING MORES LET'S AMBIGUOUS 
VL-yalgea06 3991.78 3994.70 s0001 SO LET'S DO THE THIRD SUPPOSING TRANSFER WELL FROM A 
VL-yalgea06 3994.71 3997.62 s0001 POOR TO THE RICH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE STOCK MARKET 
VL-yalgea06 3997.95 4003.00 s0001 TO GO UP SO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THE RICH GOT RICHER THE POOR GOT POORER 
VL-yalgea06 4003.01 4006.51 s0001 THE INTEREST RATES GOT LOWER AND LOWER IN THE STOCK MARKET GOT HIGHER AND HIGHER 
VL-yalgea06 4006.52 4008.05 s0001 JUST AS REASSURANCE THAT 
VL-yalgea06 4008.06 4010.32 s0001 OKAY EIGHT SO I WANNA NOW AND 
VL-yalgea06 4010.33 4014.10 s0001 WITH JUST FISHER IN SHAKESPEARE'S UM AGO OVER JUST A COUPLE MINUTES 
VL-yalgea06 4014.11 4015.36 s0001 UM 
VL-yalgea06 4015.37 4017.13 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 4020.20 4022.58 s0001 MAYBE I'LL HAVE TO START WISHING HER 
VL-yalgea06 4031.22 4034.12 s0001 OKAY SO FISHER'S THEORY OF INTERESTS 
VL-yalgea06 4034.13 4036.14 s0001 AS I SAID WAS WAS 
VL-yalgea06 4036.15 4037.34 s0001 WHAT ARE YOU KNOW 
VL-yalgea06 4037.35 4040.73 s0001 MAKING SENSE OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF CONFUSION 
VL-yalgea06 4042.37 4045.05 s0001 SO THE IDEA IS THAT THE 
VL-yalgea06 4045.06 4052.00 s0001 INTEREST IS NOTHING OTHER YOU SHOULDN'T THINK OF NOMINAL INTEREST PEOPLE LOOK THROUGH ALL THAT THEY LOOK AT THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST REAL RATE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 4052.01 4055.58 s0001 IS JUST THE RATIO OF TWO PRICES JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN 
VL-yalgea06 4055.59 4058.80 s0001 EQUILIBRIUM SO THEREFORE THERE IS NO SUCH THING 
VL-yalgea06 4058.81 4062.99 s0001 AS IF IT'S AN IMPORTANT PRICE OKAY LIKE ANYTHING ELSE 
VL-yalgea06 4063.00 4066.70 s0001 BUT I'VE NEVER GOT TO SAY THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A JUST PRICE 
VL-yalgea06 4066.71 4079.30 s0001 THE PRICE IN FACT THAT EQUILIBRIUM FIND IS THE BEST PRICE BECAUSE THAT'S THE PRICE THAT'S GOING TO LOOK THAT'S GOING TO LEAD NEW FARMS AND INVENTORS TO USE TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP THE ECONOMY AS OPPOSED TO HURTING THE ECONOMY AND WASTING RESOURCES 
VL-yalgea06 4079.31 4087.00 s0001 SO THE PRICE THAT THE MARKET FINDS IS THE JUST PRICE IN THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST IS THE RIGHT REAL RATE OF INTEREST PROVIDED THAT PEOPLE RATIONAL AND SEE TO THIS 
VL-yalgea06 4087.01 4091.61 s0001 VALE SO WHY IS IT THAT THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST IS TYPICALLY POSITIVE 
VL-yalgea06 4091.61 4093.67 s0001 WELL IT'S BECAUSE AS I SAID 
VL-yalgea06 4093.68 4095.62 s0001 YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE ARE IMPATIENT 
VL-yalgea06 4095.64 4103.80 s0001 AND THERE'D OF THESE DIFFERENT REASONS OKAY NOW FISHER SAID ONE OTHER REASON THAT SCREWS UP THE REAL RATE OF INTEREST AS PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET CONFUSED BY INFLATION 
VL-yalgea06 4103.81 4105.43 s0001 SO THIS IS AN ASIDE 
VL-yalgea06 4105.43 4109.34 s0001 HE SAID THAT ALL CONTRACT SHOULD BE INFLATION INDEXED 
VL-yalgea06 4109.35 4111.68 s0001 ANY FORCE DIZZY L. SECRETARY 
VL-yalgea06 4111.68 4116.47 s0001 TO SUCH AN IS SECRETARIES AT HIS COMPANY TO SIGN TO CHANGE THEIR CONTRACTS 
VL-yalgea06 4116.49 4121.35 s0001 TO GET I GUESS IS IL CENTRES PROBABLY RUN THE SECRETARY SAID THIS IS A BUSINESS REMINGTON 
VL-yalgea06 4121.37 4122.68 s0001 HE FORCED THEM 
VL-yalgea06 4122.68 4127.42 s0001 TWO EXCEPT DEALS WITH THEIR THEIR WAGE WAS INDEXED TO INFLATION 
VL-yalgea06 4127.43 4131.40 s0001 OF COURSE THE GREAT DEPRESSION HAPPEN AT ALL THE PRICES COLLAPSED AND SO THESE 
VL-yalgea06 4131.41 4134.25 s0001 ALL THE SECRETARIES GOT LESS MONEY OUT OF THE DEALS LEAH 
VL-yalgea06 4134.26 4136.55 s0001 AND IF HE WASN'T TOO POPULAR WITH THEM EITHER 
VL-yalgea06 4136.56 4142.63 s0001 BUT ANYWAY CELL OF OKAY HE SAYS IMPATIENCE IS A FUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTE OF HUMAN NATURE 
VL-yalgea06 4142.64 4146.20 s0001 OKAY AS LONG AS PEOPLE LIKE THINGS TODAY RATHER TOMORROW THERE'S GOING TO BE INCHES 
VL-yalgea06 4146.21 4147.66 s0001 SO IMPATIENCE 
VL-yalgea06 4147.67 4151.87 s0001 INTERESTING IS AS IT WERE IN PATIENTS CRYSTALLIZED INTO A MARKET RATE 
VL-yalgea06 4151.88 4154.65 s0001 OKAY AND THE REASONS FOR IN PATIENTS ARE THIS 
VL-yalgea06 4154.64 4156.92 s0001 FORESIGHT LACK OF FORESIGHT 
VL-yalgea06 4156.93 4163.45 s0001 EXPECTATION NO POSSIBILITY OF DYING OF ANY TEXT OF SELF CONTROL AND STUFF LIKE THAT THEY HAVE THE FORESIGHT OKAY IT'S EVER 
VL-yalgea06 4163.46 4167.09 s0001 AND NOW HE NOW YEARS AS RACIST VIEW OF THE WORLD WHICH I THINK IS 
VL-yalgea06 4167.10 4168.33 s0001 WORTH MENTIONING 
VL-yalgea06 4168.34 4174.47 s0001 SO HE COMPARES THE SCOTCH AND THE IRISH OKAY SO THE SCOTCH OR PATIENT THE IRISH ARE TOTALLY IMPATIENT 
VL-yalgea06 4174.47 4177.29 s0001 OKAY AND THEN HE HAD NO SELF CONTROL 
VL-yalgea06 4177.30 4179.63 s0001 AND THEY GET SOURCE OF WARS OF 
VL-yalgea06 4179.64 4181.93 s0001 I CAN SHOW YOU ALL THIS OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea06 4181.93 4192.05 s0001 HOLLAND SCOTLAND ENGLAND FRANCINE ALL THESE ARE ALL THE PLACES THAT HIS FAMILY WAS PROBABLY FROM THEY'RE INCREDIBLY PATIENT A WONDERFUL THAT LOW RATES OF INTEREST AND BARELY THRIFTY PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea06 4192.07 4197.21 s0001 THEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE OTHER DREADFUL PEOPLE CHINESE INDIANS BLACKS 
VL-yalgea06 4197.22 4202.93 s0001 JOBLESS SOUTHERNERS YOU KNOW AMERICAN INDIANS AND THEN GREEKS AND ITALIANS MENTIONED LATER HOPELESS 
VL-yalgea06 4202.95 4205.17 s0001 HIGH RATES OF INTEREST INCREDIBLY IMPATIENT 
VL-yalgea06 4205.18 4219.17 s0001 SO ANYWAY THE THE THE THE PATIENT ACCUMULATE WEALTH AND BY WAITING AND LENDING THEY MAKE PRODUCTION POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF ALL THE GOOD IDEAS WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE MONEY TO PRODUCE TO GET OUT OF THE PATIENT PEOPLE WILLING TO TO WAIT 
VL-yalgea06 4219.18 4220.37 s0001 OKAY NOW 
VL-yalgea06 4220.38 4224.93 s0001 IF YOU CAN WAIT CAN SHOW I TALK FOR FIVE MORE MINUTES WOULD YOU NEED TO GO INTO MY 
VL-yalgea06 4224.93 4226.33 s0001 MAYBE I SHOULD LET YOU GO 
VL-yalgea06 4226.34 4233.78 s0001 ANYWAY SO WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY LAST I WON'T SAY IS THAT SHAKESPEARE ANTICIPATED FOLLOW FISHERS IMPATIENCE THEORY OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea06 4233.79 4246.63 s0001 AND WHEN A STEP FURTHER HE SAID WELL THAT'S GREAT BUT YOU SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE WON'T KEEP THEIR PROMISES IF THEY DON'T KEEP THEIR PROMISES YOU LEAN COLLATERAL IF WE NEED COLLATERAL THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE A LOT OF STUFF AND FISHER AND SHAKESPEARE ALREADY HAD 
VL-yalgea06 4246.64 4252.24 s0001 A LOT OF THAT FIGURE OUT MOST OF THIS COURSE IS GOING TO BE ABOUT WHICH APPLY OR NOT WHAT SHAKESPEARE HAD TO SAY ABOUT 
VL-yalgea06 4252.25 4255.26 s0001 THE RATE OF INTEREST AND COLLATERAL OKAY NEXT NEXT
