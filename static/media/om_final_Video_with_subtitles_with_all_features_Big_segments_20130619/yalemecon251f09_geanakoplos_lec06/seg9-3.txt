so fisher saidso heres his famous equation 

fisher said the way to figure out the value of a stock 

if you solve that problem over here 

is to look at its dividends and discount them by the real rate 

of interest  unit of output tomorrow 

since the value of an apple tomorrow is only a third of the 

value of an output today 

remember the interest rate  r the real interest rate 

is equal to the ratio of the two goods 

so p over p is just  r 

 r is p over p 

im making some things simple seem more complicated 


sorry 

so lets just say it again 

when we solved that equilibrium over there we figured out that 

p is only a third of p 

when people think today how much would i give up of apples 

today to get an apple next year they dont think apples next 

year are worth nearly as much as apples this year 

so theyd only give up a third of an apple this year to get an 

apple next year 

p is the amount you give up today to get an apple 

next year so its a third 

another way of saying that if p is  

is that the real interest rate the tradeoff between apples 

tomorrow and apples today which is p over 

p because  apple today can give 

you three apples tomorrow so p over 

p is  so  r is three 

so the apple tomorrow is worth p times the 

dividend 

thats just  over  r times the dividend 


so the value of a stock is the real dividends its paying in 

the future discounted by the real rate of interest 

youre turning tomorrows next years goods 

finding the equivalent in terms of this years goods 

and the ratio of those two prices is the real rate of 

interest and so thats how you would get it 

so another way of saying the same thing is you could turn 

cash next year into cash this year 


so assuming q is  another way of saying that is  

over  i times dalpha times 

q 

so you take the nominal rate of interest times the money thats 

being produced because the nominal rate of 

interest says how do you trade off a dollar today for a dollar 

in the future 

so a dollar in the future isnt worth usually 

as much as a dollar today so you have to discount it 

so a certain number of dollars in the future are worth less 

dollars today 

so you take the payoff of dollars in the future discounted 

by the nominal rate of interest and you get todays price 

or you take the real dividends in the future discounted by the 

real rate of interest and you get todays price 

so both those things are an application of the principle of 

no arbitrage looking through the veil 

so what would the nominal interest rate be in this case 

in this case you see how did i know that palpha 

was still a third 

because the real interest rate hasnt changed 

its still  percent 

so dalpha is  and im still multiplying by  

third so im still getting a third for the price of alpha 

so thats how she knew that the answer should stay a third 

because she knew nothing real had changed in the economy 

therefore the real interest rate couldnt have changed 

therefore the price of the stock still had to be the same 

so how could we have used this 

another formula formula 

we have to know what the nominal interest rate is 


so what is the nominal interest rate 

if you put in a dollar today how many dollars can you get out 

in the future in this new economy where theres  

percent inflation 

yes 

 percent  

so thats right now how did he do  

because lets just do it 

you take  dollar today at price q   

you can buy  units of alpha still because its price is 

still a third and that tells you that you get 


 units of x thats the dividend 

of  units of alpha each share of alpha pays  

right  apple so now you get  apples 

but thats equal to  times  because the price is  

  dollars tomorrow 

so youve turned  dollar into  dollars 

so  i   over  implies i   percent just exactly what 

he said 

so to say that just more simply the real rate of interest  r 

this is the most famous equation fisher ever wrote 

is  i divided by  g 

so this is called the fisher equation 

his two famous equations are this this is called the fisher 

equation and this which is called 

these two things which are the same are called the fundamental 

theorem of asset pricing 

so why is this theorem true 

the real rate of interest trades off apples today for 

apples tomorrow the real rate of interest 

apples today for apples tomorrow 

so we had  apple giving you  apples 

thats why r was  percent 


well if inflation is  percent so this is  

 apple today gives you  apples in the future 

but that means  apple today gives you  dollar 

is one apple today gives you  apples or  dollars in the 

future 

so  times  so if this is equal to  and 

inflations  percent so this is equal to  then whats the 

fair rate of interest 

what will the banks give you 

well any banker can take a dollar buy a stock 


turn it into  units of dividends and then sell it for  

dollars apiece and get  dollars 

and so a banker can take a dollar and turn it to  

so competition will force the bankers to give you  dollars 

for every  dollar you give it next period 

so the interest rate has to be  i   times  

or  

so the real rate of interest is the nominal rate of interest 

divided by inflation 

so thats one subtle but once you realize it 

obvious implication of thinking people are rational and make 

sort of simple calculations looking at the future 

and a consequence of that is the price of assets 

or you look at the cash that comes out in the future 

discounted by the nominal interest rate 


or you look at the real goods that come out in the future and 

discount it by the real interest rate 

and its all the same thing 

so does anybody know what the inflation is today 

or what the nominal interest rates are today 

so i is the nominal interest rate the amount of interest you 

put in the bank and what theyll pay you at the end of a year 

so were going tonext class were going to find out the 

exact numbers but what do you think it is 

about 

does anyone have any idea 

take a wild guess 

is it  percent  percent 

yep 

i think the inflation is usually around  

percent 

usually and do you think its higher  

lower than usual nowadays 

its probably  

thats good  

so lets say its around  percent 

so that means this is  and what do you think the nominal 


interest rate is now 

 percent  

who said that  

thats a good percent thats about right 

so what is the real rate of interest now 

b 

what  

b 

well  r is less than  

so  r is around  

so the real rate of interest is actually like negative  

percent 

how did that happen
