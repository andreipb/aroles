all right so we spent a long  

reviewing general equilibrium and weve now switched to 

finance and youre hopefully going to 

see that the principles of finance emerge very quickly from 

the principles of general equilibrium 

so that although it seems it was a long interlude weve 

actually learned a lot about the financial economy 

so im going to continue with the example that we started with 

the last time 

so we have a financial economy 

so in a financial economywhat is a financial economy 

on this top board the financial economy is defined by lots of 

people in the economy and their utilities 

so here we have for simplicity two kinds of people a and b with 

utilities given by the log x  half log 

x etcetera 

its also people know today what their endowments are and 

they have some idea of what theyre going to be tomorrow 

theyre labor powered today and theyre going to be able to work 

again next year 

so the labor endowments are given by  for a 

and  for b 

and then they also know that there are two stocks in the 

economy and they have to anticipate what the dividends 

are going to be 

and as fisher said the main value of assets is 

that they give you something they produce something 

in this case theyre going to be dividends and betas 

producing dividends of  and alpha is producing a 


dividend of  next period and then the ownership of 

shares 

so thats the beginning of the economy and we want to define 

from that equilibrium which what are the 

contemporaneous prices going to be 

thats q for contemporaneous what are the prices of the 

stocks going to be and whos going to hold which 

portfolio of assets of stocks and whos going to consume what 

and so fisher said thats a very complicated problem 

you can simplify it by looking at a general equilibrium problem 

which is much shorter to describe 

and so the general equilibrium economy is going to be a much 

simpler one 

its going to consist of ua and ub the same as before 

and ehata the endowments 

ehata and ehatb 

ehatb 

so weve left out half the variables up there and we define 

ehata  ea   and 

ehatb  eb   

but ehata this is the fisher insight  

ea what a owns of the payoffs of the future 

dividends thetabaraalpha 

times dalpha plus thetabarabeta 

times dbeta 

since a owns half of the alpha stock 

sorry all of the alpha stock and half of the beta stock 

his endowment is  his original thing 

plus what the stock is going to produce 

and after all hes the owner 


so hes going to get all of  a half of  which is   

i took more space than i thought 

and so similarly ehatb is going 

to be  a half of  which   

so here endowments are this and also lets just write it here 

ehata   so this 

so fisher said we start with a financial equilibrium 

we can switch to the economic equilibrium and solve this 


problem and having solved that one go 

back and figure out how to solve this one 

and you remember what the prices were 

they turned out to be qi might as well 

write it up there what the prices we had 

we solved 

we said first of all fisher has no theory for the 

contemporaneous prices 

its all relative prices 

im going to write that 

relative prices is all we can ever figure out 

someone might always come along and change dollars to cents 

when i was a little boy in france 

on vacation they suddenly announced that 

the franc was going to be divided 

everything that was a hundred francs would now be one franc 

they just redefined the currency so that might always 

happen 

so you have to have some theory of money and whether the 

governments going to do that to figure out the nominal prices 

so contemporaneous prices he says are  

all right but having realized that if there are many goods at 


time  he could figure out the relative prices 

but with only  good at time one whos to say whether were 

measuring dollars or francs or cents 

well just call it  and the same things going to 

happen next year 

who knows whether its dollars or cents or francs so were 

going to call it  again 

but after that he figured everything out 

this turned out to be a price of a third 

this turned out to be a price of  thirds and we figured out 


all the consumptions which ive forgotten of course 

but anyway they werewho knows what they were 

not that its too important 

all right well i forgot what they were 

anyway he figured out all the consumptions 

i think they wereactually i sort of remember them 

well lets say i dont 

anyway he figured out all the consumptions 


does anyone remember what they were 

all right i will look them up  thirds  thirds  

so they were  thirds and  and  thirds and  

he figured out in equilibrium and how did he do itbecause 

he solved over here first 

we would have solvedhe didnt do this exact problem 

but he would have solved over here and we would have found 

with p   p  a third 

and sure enough xa   thirds 

xa   and xb   

thirds and xb   

so fisher said start with the financial economy 

figure out what the reduced general equilibrium is 

solve for this equilibrium and go back and figure out what 


the financial equilibrium should be 

all right so i want to now examine what weve done 

and we did that the end of last class 

you had to do it in a problem set 

and you notice that the only difference between this and that 

is the general equilibrium throws 

away a lot of irrelevant information because fisher said 

people are rational 

they look through the veil of all the gibberish of who owns 

the company and stuff like that and theyre just anticipating 

what the company is going to produce 

they dont really care about whether theres a man running 

the company or a woman running the company 

or whether shes got an mba from harvard or from yale 


none of this is relevant what the business plan is 

all they care about is whats going to actually happen in the 

end 

so if you think theyre going to anticipate that correctly you 

dont need to worry about all the other stuff 

so looking through the veil you can always reduce the financial 

equilibrium to a general equilibrium 

now i want to go back and reexamine all that logic 

so whats the first step in what fisher did 


and this is the idea of no arbitrage 

so fisher said people look through the veil of things 

they understand stuff and you can count on their understanding 

to guide your understanding of the economy 

so if you know that pialpha 

this is a big pipialpha  a 

third so fisher says well 

you dont have to solve for the whole equilibrium to figure out 

what pibeta is 

what would pibeta be 

well fisher would have said stock beta always pays off 

exactly what stock alpha pays off 

so if these people are rational theyre not going to allow for 

an arbitrage 

so arbitrage means if there are two assets or two things that 

are identical they have to sell for the same 

pricethats no arbitrage 

if they sold for a different price thered be an arbitrage 

youd sell the more expensive one and buy the cheaper one 

and so youd have accomplished a perfect tradeoff 

but youd have gotten the difference of money 

so since pialpha is  third pibeta has 

to equal  thirds 

thats the first most important principle of 

finance that fisher introduced the idea of no arbitrage and
