all right so we spent a long  

reviewing general equilibrium and weve now switched to 

finance and youre hopefully going to 

see that the principles of finance emerge very quickly from 

the principles of general equilibrium 

so that although it seems it was a long interlude weve 

actually learned a lot about the financial economy 

so im going to continue with the example that we started with 

the last time 

so we have a financial economy 

so in a financial economywhat is a financial economy 

on this top board the financial economy is defined by lots of 

people in the economy and their utilities 

so here we have for simplicity two kinds of people a and b with 

utilities given by the log x  half log 

x etcetera 

its also people know today what their endowments are and 

they have some idea of what theyre going to be tomorrow 

theyre labor powered today and theyre going to be able to work 

again next year 

so the labor endowments are given by  for a 

and  for b 

and then they also know that there are two stocks in the 

economy and they have to anticipate what the dividends 

are going to be 

and as fisher said the main value of assets is 

that they give you something they produce something 

in this case theyre going to be dividends and betas 

producing dividends of  and alpha is producing a 


dividend of  next period and then the ownership of 

shares 

so thats the beginning of the economy and we want to define 

from that equilibrium which what are the 

contemporaneous prices going to be 

thats q for contemporaneous what are the prices of the 

stocks going to be and whos going to hold which 

portfolio of assets of stocks and whos going to consume what 

and so fisher said thats a very complicated problem 

you can simplify it by looking at a general equilibrium problem 

which is much shorter to describe 

and so the general equilibrium economy is going to be a much 

simpler one 

its going to consist of ua and ub the same as before 

and ehata the endowments 

ehata and ehatb 

ehatb 

so weve left out half the variables up there and we define 

ehata  ea   and 

ehatb  eb   

but ehata this is the fisher insight  

ea what a owns of the payoffs of the future 

dividends thetabaraalpha 

times dalpha plus thetabarabeta 

times dbeta 

since a owns half of the alpha stock 

sorry all of the alpha stock and half of the beta stock 

his endowment is  his original thing 

plus what the stock is going to produce 

and after all hes the owner 


so hes going to get all of  a half of  which is   

i took more space than i thought 

and so similarly ehatb is going 

to be  a half of  which   

so here endowments are this and also lets just write it here 

ehata   so this 

so fisher said we start with a financial equilibrium 

we can switch to the economic equilibrium and solve this 


problem and having solved that one go 

back and figure out how to solve this one 

and you remember what the prices were 

they turned out to be qi might as well 

write it up there what the prices we had 

we solved 

we said first of all fisher has no theory for the 

contemporaneous prices 

its all relative prices 

im going to write that 

relative prices is all we can ever figure out 

someone might always come along and change dollars to cents 

when i was a little boy in france 

on vacation they suddenly announced that 

the franc was going to be divided 

everything that was a hundred francs would now be one franc 

they just redefined the currency so that might always 

happen 

so you have to have some theory of money and whether the 

governments going to do that to figure out the nominal prices 

so contemporaneous prices he says are  

all right but having realized that if there are many goods at 


time  he could figure out the relative prices 

but with only  good at time one whos to say whether were 

measuring dollars or francs or cents 

well just call it  and the same things going to 

happen next year 

who knows whether its dollars or cents or francs so were 

going to call it  again 

but after that he figured everything out 

this turned out to be a price of a third 

this turned out to be a price of  thirds and we figured out 


all the consumptions which ive forgotten of course 

but anyway they werewho knows what they were 

not that its too important 

all right well i forgot what they were 

anyway he figured out all the consumptions 

i think they wereactually i sort of remember them 

well lets say i dont 

anyway he figured out all the consumptions 


does anyone remember what they were 

all right i will look them up  thirds  thirds  

so they were  thirds and  and  thirds and  

he figured out in equilibrium and how did he do itbecause 

he solved over here first 

we would have solvedhe didnt do this exact problem 

but he would have solved over here and we would have found 

with p   p  a third 

and sure enough xa   thirds 

xa   and xb   

thirds and xb   

so fisher said start with the financial economy 

figure out what the reduced general equilibrium is 

solve for this equilibrium and go back and figure out what 


the financial equilibrium should be 

all right so i want to now examine what weve done 

and we did that the end of last class 

you had to do it in a problem set 

and you notice that the only difference between this and that 

is the general equilibrium throws 

away a lot of irrelevant information because fisher said 

people are rational 

they look through the veil of all the gibberish of who owns 

the company and stuff like that and theyre just anticipating 

what the company is going to produce 

they dont really care about whether theres a man running 

the company or a woman running the company 

or whether shes got an mba from harvard or from yale 


none of this is relevant what the business plan is 

all they care about is whats going to actually happen in the 

end 

so if you think theyre going to anticipate that correctly you 

dont need to worry about all the other stuff 

so looking through the veil you can always reduce the financial 

equilibrium to a general equilibrium 

now i want to go back and reexamine all that logic 

so whats the first step in what fisher did 


and this is the idea of no arbitrage 

so fisher said people look through the veil of things 

they understand stuff and you can count on their understanding 

to guide your understanding of the economy 

so if you know that pialpha 

this is a big pipialpha  a 

third so fisher says well 

you dont have to solve for the whole equilibrium to figure out 

what pibeta is 

what would pibeta be 

well fisher would have said stock beta always pays off 

exactly what stock alpha pays off 

so if these people are rational theyre not going to allow for 

an arbitrage 

so arbitrage means if there are two assets or two things that 

are identical they have to sell for the same 

pricethats no arbitrage 

if they sold for a different price thered be an arbitrage 

youd sell the more expensive one and buy the cheaper one 

and so youd have accomplished a perfect tradeoff 

but youd have gotten the difference of money 

so since pialpha is  third pibeta has 

to equal  thirds 

thats the first most important principle of 

finance that fisher introduced the idea of no arbitrage and 


making deductions for no arbitrage 

so most of finance is actually being more and more clever about 

how to do no arbitrage 

over half of this course is going to be lets look at 

situations where at first glance there doesnt seem to be any 

arbitrage 

then you realize if youre clever enough youll recognize 

an arbitrage and be able to figure out all the prices 

without having to know all the utilities and everything else 

so one of the main goals of finance is to explain asset 


prices 

you can see how no arbitrage is going to help do that 

because if you knew what some of the asset prices were you 

could deduce what the rest might be 

so thats the first thing fisher did and hes used this 

fact in connecting these two economies 

so thats the first thing 

now that principle can be used over and over again 


another application of it lets suppose that we 

introduced a nominal bond with payoff  dollar in period  

and suppose as before that q  

q   as weve already supposed 

so then by definition the price of this bond is equal to  over 

 i where i is the nominal interest rate 

why is that 

because youre going to get a dollar next year 

if the price is less than a dollar this year youre turning 

something less than a dollar into something equal to a 

dollar 

youre multiplying todays price by  i to get tomorrows 

price so the rate of return is  i 

taking whatever you put in today and getting  i tomorrow 

so what is  i 

so by no arbitrage we can figure out what  i must be 

so  dollar today can go into  units of stock alpha 

which goes into  units of x as dividends 

which equals  dollars 

so you take  dollar today by buying stock alpha you can get  

units of it since its price is a third 

and since stock alpha pays one unit of output next period you 

know that  dollar today gives you  units of stock alpha 

which gives you  units of good  as the output and at price  

dollar tomorrow youve anticipated thats  dollars 

so by buying stock alpha you can put in a dollar and get out 

 dollars 

so it means that  i   which means the interest rate 


is  percent 

so thats a second thing you can deduce from that 

so notice that by looking at part of the equilibrium here we 

can figure out a lot of the rest of the equilibrium 

so whats another application 

well fisher said define the real interest rate as number of 

goods today goes into number of good tomorrow 

so this will be  r equals that 

the number of goods today and how many good tomorrow do you 


get 

so how can you do that 

well  good today  unit of x is  

dollar today right 

if you had one apple today you could sell it for q 

times  apple which is q times  

which is  times  which is  dollar today 

which you can get  units  shares  units of stock 

alpha which gives you  units of x 

so  unit of x today turns into  units of 


x so therefore  r   implies r 

  percent 

so thats the real rate of interest 

so one of the tricks in going from here to here was to say 

that fisher realized that people are going to look through all 

the gibberish of money and theyre going to think about 

what apples are they giving up today and what apples are they 

getting tomorrow 

theyre not going to be confused by all the holding of 

assets in between 

all right so lets just make it a little bit more 

complicated 

suppose we started with q   

q   

now i told you that equilibriumfisher says theres 

always a normalization 

walras originally had the normalization in one period 

theres a one period model in general equilibrium 

in multiperiod models theres a normalization every period 

every period theres a choice of whether youre dealing with 

dollars or francs or centimes 

or how many and so theres a free 

normalization 

so lets take q   and q   

well what does that mean 

that means that inflation  lets call it growth of money 

gi ive already used for the nominal interest rate 

so  g is going to be  over  or just  

so inflation   percent 

so whats pialpha going to be 

ive done my work 

now the rest im going to just ask you for the rest of the 

numbers 

whats pialpha 

so if i resolved equilibrium taking q   and 

q   all thats kind of money stuff so its not 


going to change what happens over there 

youre going to get the same equilibrium over there and 

youre going to go back to over here 

so whats pialpha going to be 

ahha 

suppose we knew we were in the same real economy 

theres nothing changed about utilities endowments of goods 

productivity of the stocks 

all we know is that inflations going to be higher now 

so what do you think would happen in the new equilibrium 

whats going to happen to the price of stocks today 

yes 

is it just   

price of stock  

what was it before 

b 

so what was it  

 third  

yeah  third so its still   

this is a big mystery in finance a big question in 

finance 

so you see why its puzzling 

you didnt get the answer right off although she did 

so you just have to think about it a second 

if you really thought that people when they were buying and 

selling only bought a stock because they said to themselves 

how many apples am i going to get out of this stock 

i dont care about dollars and centimes and francs 

im not going to eat that 

im going to eat the apples and maybe i get the apples and 

sell them and eat pears instead but i care about the goods im 

going to get 

so i looked through all the veil 

i should recognize that the stock although its now going 

to pay twice as many dollars as it did before 

so its going to pay  dollars 

thats how someone guessed  

someone said  

so how did he get  

i didnt even realize how he came up with the number  

he came up with the number  because he said 


well the stock is paying  apple tomorrow 

the price of apples is now  so its paying  dollars 

tomorrow so maybe its price today should be  

but no that isnt how much the stock is worth 

the stock is worth solving for this general equilibrium supply 

and demand 

we already calculated before that the stock was a third 

so the price of the stock is going to stay a third because 

the apples it pays tomorrow hasnt changed 

its still the same one apple 

now how did we know the stock was priced at a third before 

what was the stock in general 

whats the price of the stock 

the price of stock remember is how did we get it 


by going from here to here 

we said its going to equal the price of the stock divided by 

p 

now the stock is only paying a certain number of goods 

the price of the stock today is going to equal the present value 

 over  r times its dividend 

ill write it this way 

the price of the stock is p times this 

lets just write this 

what would fisher say 

how did we get the price of the stock from going from here to 


here 

we got the price of the stock by saying the stock pays off one 

good tomorrow but one good tomorrow is only 

worth a third of one good today so therefore the value of the 

stock is only equal to a third times    third 

so assuming p   thats what fisher would say 

assuming p is  you figure out how many units of 

todays good is it worth 

now if p isnt  then what do you do 

suppose p were  and p wereor 

p is  lets say and p is 

 then what would you do 

youd have to say p times pialpha  

dalpha 

so if you multiplied all the prices byam i putting the 

p down at the bottom or the top 

if you multiply out all the prices by  just leave it like 

this 

well say if pialpha  p times 

dalpha 

if you measure it in terms of goods thats how you do it 

so if you take this this is also equal to  over 

p divided by p if p 

is  assuming p is  

times dalpha which is  over  r times 


dalpha 

so fisher saidso heres his famous equation 

fisher said the way to figure out the value of a stock 

if you solve that problem over here 

is to look at its dividends and discount them by the real rate 

of interest  unit of output tomorrow 

since the value of an apple tomorrow is only a third of the 

value of an output today 

remember the interest rate  r the real interest rate 

is equal to the ratio of the two goods 

so p over p is just  r 

 r is p over p 

im making some things simple seem more complicated 


sorry 

so lets just say it again 

when we solved that equilibrium over there we figured out that 

p is only a third of p 

when people think today how much would i give up of apples 

today to get an apple next year they dont think apples next 

year are worth nearly as much as apples this year 

so theyd only give up a third of an apple this year to get an 

apple next year 

p is the amount you give up today to get an apple 

next year so its a third 

another way of saying that if p is  

is that the real interest rate the tradeoff between apples 

tomorrow and apples today which is p over 

p because  apple today can give 

you three apples tomorrow so p over 

p is  so  r is three 

so the apple tomorrow is worth p times the 

dividend 

thats just  over  r times the dividend 


so the value of a stock is the real dividends its paying in 

the future discounted by the real rate of interest 

youre turning tomorrows next years goods 

finding the equivalent in terms of this years goods 

and the ratio of those two prices is the real rate of 

interest and so thats how you would get it 

so another way of saying the same thing is you could turn 

cash next year into cash this year 


so assuming q is  another way of saying that is  

over  i times dalpha times 

q 

so you take the nominal rate of interest times the money thats 

being produced because the nominal rate of 

interest says how do you trade off a dollar today for a dollar 

in the future 

so a dollar in the future isnt worth usually 

as much as a dollar today so you have to discount it 

so a certain number of dollars in the future are worth less 

dollars today 

so you take the payoff of dollars in the future discounted 

by the nominal rate of interest and you get todays price 

or you take the real dividends in the future discounted by the 

real rate of interest and you get todays price 

so both those things are an application of the principle of 

no arbitrage looking through the veil 

so what would the nominal interest rate be in this case 

in this case you see how did i know that palpha 

was still a third 

because the real interest rate hasnt changed 

its still  percent 

so dalpha is  and im still multiplying by  

third so im still getting a third for the price of alpha 

so thats how she knew that the answer should stay a third 

because she knew nothing real had changed in the economy 

therefore the real interest rate couldnt have changed 

therefore the price of the stock still had to be the same 

so how could we have used this 

another formula formula 

we have to know what the nominal interest rate is 


so what is the nominal interest rate 

if you put in a dollar today how many dollars can you get out 

in the future in this new economy where theres  

percent inflation 

yes 

 percent  

so thats right now how did he do  

because lets just do it 

you take  dollar today at price q   

you can buy  units of alpha still because its price is 

still a third and that tells you that you get 


 units of x thats the dividend 

of  units of alpha each share of alpha pays  

right  apple so now you get  apples 

but thats equal to  times  because the price is  

  dollars tomorrow 

so youve turned  dollar into  dollars 

so  i   over  implies i   percent just exactly what 

he said 

so to say that just more simply the real rate of interest  r 

this is the most famous equation fisher ever wrote 

is  i divided by  g 

so this is called the fisher equation 

his two famous equations are this this is called the fisher 

equation and this which is called 

these two things which are the same are called the fundamental 

theorem of asset pricing 

so why is this theorem true 

the real rate of interest trades off apples today for 

apples tomorrow the real rate of interest 

apples today for apples tomorrow 

so we had  apple giving you  apples 

thats why r was  percent 


well if inflation is  percent so this is  

 apple today gives you  apples in the future 

but that means  apple today gives you  dollar 

is one apple today gives you  apples or  dollars in the 

future 

so  times  so if this is equal to  and 

inflations  percent so this is equal to  then whats the 

fair rate of interest 

what will the banks give you 

well any banker can take a dollar buy a stock 


turn it into  units of dividends and then sell it for  

dollars apiece and get  dollars 

and so a banker can take a dollar and turn it to  

so competition will force the bankers to give you  dollars 

for every  dollar you give it next period 

so the interest rate has to be  i   times  

or  

so the real rate of interest is the nominal rate of interest 

divided by inflation 

so thats one subtle but once you realize it 

obvious implication of thinking people are rational and make 

sort of simple calculations looking at the future 

and a consequence of that is the price of assets 

or you look at the cash that comes out in the future 

discounted by the nominal interest rate 


or you look at the real goods that come out in the future and 

discount it by the real interest rate 

and its all the same thing 

so does anybody know what the inflation is today 

or what the nominal interest rates are today 

so i is the nominal interest rate the amount of interest you 

put in the bank and what theyll pay you at the end of a year 

so were going tonext class were going to find out the 

exact numbers but what do you think it is 

about 

does anyone have any idea 

take a wild guess 

is it  percent  percent 

yep 

i think the inflation is usually around  

percent 

usually and do you think its higher  

lower than usual nowadays 

its probably  

thats good  

so lets say its around  percent 

so that means this is  and what do you think the nominal 


interest rate is now 

 percent  

who said that  

thats a good percent thats about right 

so what is the real rate of interest now 

b 

what  

b 

well  r is less than  

so  r is around  

so the real rate of interest is actually like negative  

percent 

how did that happen 


do you think its standard to have the real interest rate be 

under  

so why is it under  

whats going on now that would make that happen 

yep 

the federal reserve wants to  

investment 

ah ha  

the federal reserve has cut the interest rate 

the nominal interest rate that it lends at to close to  

lets say to  percent on the  year bond to  on the  month 

thing 

so the reason theyre saying theyre doing that is to 

stimulate investment 

thats what they teach you in macro keynesian 

stimulate investment 

were going to find out that thats not the reason theyre 

doing it at all 

the reason the federal reserve is cutting the interest rate to 

almost zero is to just give money away to the banks 

and why it that 

well when you put your money and deposit it in the bank 


youre getting almost no interest 

so the banks the big banks have got all 

these deposits and people dont change what they do 

they just leave their money in the banks getting no interest 

so the banks have the money for free and they can make money 

with it 

so normally theyd have to pay  percent interest or something 

and that would be expensive for them 


and that expense is a big part of their expenses 

they dont have it anymore 

so were going to come back to that whats really going on 

today but thats whats going on 

but anyway the point is the nominal interest rate is somehow 

controlled by the fed 

thats why we dont have a theory of it 

were not going to do macro in this course 

so fisher doesnt have a theory of the nominal interest rate 

of inflation but he does tell you 

given inflation and the nominal interest rate 

thats determining a real interest rate 

and people should look through that 

so now they should say this is sort of the keynesian 

part they should realize that 

actually an apple today if you just sort of put it in the bank 

you get less than an apple in the future so you should spend 

it and do something with it 

thats the keynesian idea so peoplewhy fritter away 


part of your apple do something with it 

thats why its supposed to stimulate demand and activity 

today 

so the point is thats how you calculate the 

real rate of interest and shockingly its negative and 

its hardly ever negative but it can be negative 

are there any questions about this no arbitrage business 

all right so lets do one more trick here a fisher thing 

so lets go back to the equilibrium with q  

 and q   

suppose china offered to lend money lend us dollars at a  

percent interest 

would that be a great deal 

would people rush to do that 

this is the equilibrium we solved over here already 

so is that a great deal 

would that upset the equilibrium 

would anyone bother to take the chinese deal if they lent at  

percent interest they were offering to do that 



what 

no  

professor john they wouldnt take it 

were back here 

whats the nominal interest rate in this economy 

 percent  

professor john  percent interest 

so if you want to borrow in this economy from another 

american you have to give the guy  percent interest 

here the chinese are offering to lend you at  percent 


interest 

so yes everyone would rush to take the thing and that would 

have a big effect on what the equilibrium was if the chinese 

were willing to lend money at such a low rate of interest 

lets try another question 

suppose you invented a technology new technology 

new technology turns  unit  apple today 

into  apples tomorrow 

is this something people would rush to do or not 

suppose some inventor figured out how to do that 

would he rush to do it 

could it be used to help the economy 

so lets put it this way 

could this new technology be used to make a pareto 

improvement everybody better off 

yep 

thats no because an apple tomorrow  

worth less than half of an apple today 

its worth a third of an apple today so no one would want to 

do that 

professor john so thats exactly the right 

answer 

actually youre answering two questions 

i asked two questions 

one is could it be used to help the economy make everybody 

better off 

if a social planner was in charge of things and the chinese 

invented this new technology or some american in alaska 

invented this new technology should the government use the 

technology and could it use the technology to make everybody 

better off and the answer to that is no 

and then the answer to a second question issuppose the guy in 


alaska discovered it himself 

he couldnt care less about the pareto improvement and helping 

other guys or the american planners or anything 

he just wanted to make a profit for himself 

would he make a profit 

the answer is no because the real prices 

fisher would say are  and a third and no matter 

how you look at it the interest rate is  

hes losing money because hes giving something 


up thats worth  and hes getting something thats only 

worth  thirds 

so hed be losing money to do it 

hed lose money 

so we could prove that even 

so the answer is no 

thats the first question and nobody would do it anyway 

and fortunately nobody would choose to do itchoose to use 

itbecause it loses money 

so those are two separate questions 

could it be used and would any individual choose to do it 

would it be good for the society and would any individual 


choose to do it 

the answers happen to agree here 

so why cant it be used as a pareto improvement 

whats the proof of this that it cant be 

the answers no 

whats the proof 

well the proof is that if it did 

if in the end it led to an allocation 

xhata lets call it xtilde 

a xtildea 

and xtildeb xtildeb that 

made everyone better off 

then well we give their old proof 

then what 

it means that p xtildea 

p xtildea is bigger 

than what 

p ehata 

all right thats what you have in the fisher economy 

p ehata and similarly p 

xtildeb p 

xtildeb is bigger than p 

ehatb p 

ehatb 

so why is that 

because in this fisher economy the general equilibrium 

if this allocation really made a better off than what hes 

gotten than  third and  

he would have chosen it 


and b she would have chosen her thing if it was better than 

 thirds and  

so clearly they must have been too expensive for those two to 

choose because they were rationally choosing the right 

thing given what they could afford 

so then you just add the stuff up 

you add and you find that total consumption value is bigger than 

total endowment value 

thats in the fisher economy but weve changed the fisher 

economy because now weve added this technology which took away 

some of the first good and made it into the second good 

but that technology just lost money 

which is bigger than total value in new technology economy 

right 

and so thats a contradiction because the consumption of this 

however the new technology got used in the end the total 

consumption of the people had to be the total of what there was 

and what was produced in the economy 

the value after the new technology is introduced in that 

new economy has only gone down compared to the fisher economy 

and the fisher economy value of endowments must have been less 

than this brilliant new allocation 

and thats a contradiction because this new allocation has 

to add up to the stuff thats there in the new technology 

economy 

so thats how we know that no new technology could possibly 

make everybody better off and we know trivially it makes 


everyone better off if and only if it makes a profit 

so if and only if it makes a profit can it be used to make 

everybody better off and amazingly 

in a free market economy people are going to use it if 

and only if it makes a profit 

so theyre going to use it if and only if its a good thing 

for the economy 

so thats the basic laissezfaire argumentthat 

there are new discoveries all the time 

every other day somebodys thinking of something new 

are we going to use it 

should we use it 

is it something we need to read about in the papers and use 

well there are a whole bunch of people 

the discoverers themselves theyre going to talk to their 

business friends and theyre going to say 

do you want to lend me the money to get this thing 

going and all of them are going to do this profit 

calculation 

if they decide it loses money theyre not going to do it 


and thank god for that because it couldnt have helped 

everybody if they did use it 

so thats the main lesson of laissezfaire 

so let me just put this in perspective a little bit 

in the old russian economy of the s and s there was no 

profit system so the central planner had to 

figure out should a new invention be used 

or not 

so every time theres a new invention a committee had to get 

together of central planners and decide whether to use it or 


not 

and theres a famous guy named kantorovich who was in charge of 

a lot of that 

he won the nobel prize in economics 

he shared it with a yale economist named koopmans and so 

kantorovich told this very amusing story 

he said that there were two central planning bureaus 

one was in charge of allocations and one was in 

charge of prices 

one had to set the prices 

the other had to set the allocations 

and of course the whole message here is that you have to combine 


these 

you dont know whether its worthwhile to change the 

allocation until you know whether the new technologys 

going to make a profit or not and here they had the two 

things separated 

they were telling people what to do before knowing whether 

they made a profit or not because they didnt have prices 

because there werent free markets 

so the bottom line of the fisher story is that you take 

this complicated financial economy 

you reduce it to something very simple that you learned how to 


do in your freshman year or your sophomore year 

solve that and you go back to this and you can understand a 

lot about this economy 

thats something that most people didnt realize at the 

time and still dont realize now 

so you ask a typical person if theres inflation 

that means the dividends next year is going to be higher 

is that going to raise the value of the stock today 

just like he said yes of course because it 


makes the price of the dividends higher tomorrow 

fisher would say no it doesnt change anything real 

in the economy 

if theres more inflation there will be a higher nominal 

interest rate so discounted by the higher 

interest rate payoffs of the stock will give you the same 

stock price as before 

so were going to do a thousand examples of this 

but are there any questions about this 

yes 

can you just review your arguments at  


end 

im just having a very hard time reading 

yeah sorry  

i dont know if this is in the way by the way 

so this is the argument we gave a few classes ago 

i forgot when 

we said how do you know that a final allocation that emerges as 

a competitive equilibrium is pareto efficient 

and the argument was if you can do better 

that means make everybody better off 


then each person if you look at the value of 

what theyre getting under the new regime it must be more than 

the value of their endowments otherwise they would have chosen 

the new regime and nobody chose it 

that means everybody would have had to pay more for this new 

regime allocation than the value of their endowments 

so this is more than that for person a 

and person bs consumption is more than the value of this 

endowments his extended endowments in the 

fisher thing under this new regime 

than the value of his endowments 

youre following that 

yeah  

then the next step was to add all this  

now notice however the new technology affects the world 

obviously people can only eat whats being produced 

everything thats being produced is part of somebodys 

endowment 

so if the new technology if mr a invents the new 

technology he gives up some of his good at 

time  to get more of the good at time  

so his endowment has changedbut hes got a new 

endowment but its still his endowment 

so whatever the new allocation is it has to add up to the new 

endowment 

now i havent even bothered to write down the new endowment 

but i know the value of that new endowment 

whatever it is its going to be less than the 

value of the old endowment because the new technology 

loses money 

so the contradiction is the value of the new endowment after 

the technology is used at the old equilibrium prices 


is lower than the value of the old endowment at the old 

equilibrium prices 

but that since its true for every person in the aggregate 

thats less than the value of this new regime consumption 

and thats a contradiction because the new regime 

consumption thats all this stuff 

has to equal exactly the total endowments in the economy to 

begin with and thats the contradiction 

so you cant make everybody better off 

that simple argument which as i said 


my advisor ken arrow another guy at yale named 

gerard debreu both of them were working at 

the cowles foundation which is part of yale 

that proof that they gave is the simplest and most important 

argument in all of economics 

so we get as a conclusion that putting it another way 

that owners of firms should maximize the value of their 

firms the stock market value of their 

firms and thank god they do because 

if they find some new way of producing thats going to lose 

money its going to make the stock market value go down 

remember the stock market value is just the same calculation 

the value of all the output theyre producing 

if they find some way of losing money and they try to use it 

itll make their stock market value go down 

thats why theyre not going to do it and thank god for that 

because itd be a bad thing for society if they did do it 

yes 

well it seems to me this proof  

logically flawed because youre assuming that after the 

inception of a technology the prices are left unchanged 

but that might not be true 

shouldnt you have some argument for the prices not 

changing after the inception of the technology 


this is a very bold  

telling me that its a flawed proof 

i want to commend you for your courage 

as it happens however youve asked the same 

question that somebody asked a class or twowhich is a very 

good question 

so the answer is no i shouldnt have changed the 

prices and thats exactly the point of the proof 

so yes its true that after the new technology is introduced 

the prices changes everything changes 

but we dont have to worry about all that complication 

after all the changes theres going to be some final 

allocation of goods that supposedly makes everybody 

better off 

so i can ask the hypothetical question 

would this new allocation to a at the old prices be something 

he could have afforded and the answer must be no 

all right ive got  

well let me just  

you see the answer to your question but im going to say 

it out because its a very important question 

the proof is clever precisely because of what youre asking 

you have to do something that you wouldnt have thought of 

you have this new economy and new allocation 

and new prices but the proof says lets do the 

hypothetical thing of looking at the new allocation at the old 

prices 

at the old prices a couldnt have afforded this new 

allocation because if he could have he would have bought it 

because it makes him better off 

so at the old prices a couldnt have afforded this new regime 


allocation 

similarly b at the old prices 

couldnt afford this new regime allocation 

so at the old prices everybody would have to be spending more 

on the new regime allocation than the value of their 

endowment 

that means at the old prices the total in the whole 

society by adding it upof the 

expenditures on the new regime consumptions must be bigger than 

the total value of the old endowments 

now that was the contradiction why at the old endowments 

without production you couldnt make everybody better off 

wed already have a contradiction 

now we add one more step 

weve got this new technology that changed the old endowments 

it changed the old endowments but however it changed it we 

dont have to keep track of how it did it 

it makes the value of the total endowments even less than it was 


before so we actually get a worse contradiction than before 

so it was a good question so i thank you for the 

question 

any other questions 

yes 

can you raise the board a little  

yes i can raise which  

not this one 

yes that one  

yeah  

well sorry 

oh  

so the bottom line here is thatlet me  


summarize 

weve spent four classes on reviewing standard intermediate 

micro and macro 

people never talk about that stuff when they do 

financialfinance courses in typical courses 

however irving fisher the inventor of half of 

finance thats how he began 

and its going to turn out now especially in light of this 

last crisis that the best way to understand 

whats going on is to go back to the original underlying economy 

so fisher said you can always takewe havent introduced 


risk by the way 

when that happens things are going to get more complicated 

fisher couldnt deal with risk 

so without risk where everybodys anticipating 

the dividends in the future that means that you can always 

reduce a financial economy up there to a general equilibrium 

which youve been taught before you got to this course 

most of you how to solve 

and now that solution to that problem with marginal utility 

and pareto efficiency that tells us an enormous amount about how 

the stock market and everything works 

it tells us that the value of every stock is just the 

discounted real dividends discounted at the real rate of 

interest or the discounted nominal 

payoffs cash flows discounted at the nominal rate 

of interest 

and it tells us that the real rate of interest is the nominal 

rate divided by the rate of inflation 


and it tells us that its a good thing all these owners of 

companies are maximizing profits or share value 

which is the same thing and thats helping society 

so thats the lesson 

a lot of that stuff is going to change a little bit 

but thats the basic idea 

so finally lets get to the point 

for  years the public was confused about interest 

they saidaristotle one of the greatest geniuses of 

all times he thought interest was an unnatural act 

it was horrible even though of course lots of people in 

greece were charging interest 

delos the delphic oracle was charging interest 

would lend money at interest and aristotle and everybody was 

talking about the delphic oracle all the time 

they werent even paying attention 

the delphic oracle was charging interest and they were saying 

its totally unnatural 

so three religions all thought interest was a terrible thing 

they all thought the just price wasthe nominal rate of 

interest should be  but what fisher says is the 

nominal rate of interest is irrelevant 

nobody cares about the nominal rate of interest 

they look at apples today and apples next year 

the money and stuff just gets in the way 

its the real rate of interest that you care about 

and the real rate of interest doesnt have to be positive 

it could be negative like it is today 

the real rate of interest what are the determinants 

usually of the real rate of interest if the federal reserve 


isnt mucking around with things 

the real rate of interest is obtained by solving for 

p and p in this general equilibrium 

model 

so what would change the real rate of interest 

all you have are the utilities and the endowments 

so heres the economy 

what would change the real rate of interest 

so the first thing fisher says is impatience 

so in fact one of his most famous articles is called an 

impatience theory of interest so lets call it that 


impatience theory of interest 

so fisher said that in his view people are impatient 

why 

that means an apple today they thought was more valuable that 

an apple next year 

why 

because of the poor imagination it was easy to 

think about eating the apple today 

you can just hold it in your hand and its so close 

but to think about eating it in a year requires some 

imagination 

they had poor imagination and secondly 


the second main reason is mortality 

they might die between today and next year 

so those are the two main reasons 

he gives a bunch of others which im going to mention 

shortly but these are the two most 

interesting ones poverty of imagination and the 

fact that you just might die in between 

so what does it mean 

an apple next year is not a sure thing 

there is the impatience theory of interest 

so he said thats why it makes sense to have this guy a as 

impatient because he values the apple today more than a value 

tomorrow 

hes got this discount rate a half here 

bs not impatient because the discount factor is one 

so he put a discount factoractually fisher didnt 

quite have a discount factor he had a more general thing 

so samuelson was the one who introduced the discount factor 

it doesnt matter but anyway so a discount factor 

to capture fishers idea that the good next year 

the same apple next year is not worth as much to a as an apple 

this year 

so suppose i change a half to a third 


what will happen to the real rate of interest 

so that makes people more impatient 

why does it make them more impatient because now they care 

even less about the good next year 

so when did this happen 

in the reagan years the now generation 

everybody talked about the now generation 

people are getting more impatient 

so what happens to the real rate of interest when people get 

more impatient 

does it go up or down 

it goes up  

so why does it go  

thats correct 

because there needs to be more of an  

to save 

right but now fisher would say that  


little bit more he would say it a little more 

formally but thats exactly right 

in order to get anybody to save because they want the 

stuff now youre going to have to give them a higher real rate 

of interest 

thats exactly right 

so how could you say it in this economy 

next slower remember in this economy 

this cobbdouglas economy you could prove it formally 

you know that if p lets say   and were 

solving for p and heres the supply 

this is x and heres demand 

so remember xa is going to be something like 

p ea p ea 

times  over  delta where delta 

whats called delta the discount 

lets call this delta so the discount 

so to get these to add up to  i take  delta 


so the weight on this thing is  over  delta times this 

divided by p 

so if p is  then this is just equal to  over  

delta times ea  over p times 

ea 

so clearly the demand goes down as p goes 

as pthis is p 

so p   so if i divide by 

p p over 

p goes away 

then i have p over p 

and if p is  thats just  over 

p 

so obviously as p goes up your demand goes down 

thats just what youd expect 

so p goes down the demand goes up 

or p goes up the demand goes down 

so anyway if you add up cobbdouglas people it always is 

like that 

the demand for any good goes up as the price goes down 

if its own price goes down 

so if you change delta if you make delta smaller 

thats going to raise demand for a at the old 

prices 

why 

at old equilibrium prices the same trick as before 

at old equilibrium prices whats going to happen 

delta goes down like we just said implies xa 

goes up 

so the guys demanding more now but if hes demanding more 

at the old equilibrium prices so at the old equilibrium 

prices hes demanding more so the only way to clear the market 


is to raise p 

implies p must go up to clear the market 

so this is a formal proof of what he just said 

so the common sense maybe is enough for you 

if you care less about the future to get anybody to save 

youre going to have to raise the interest rate 

to say it formally if we solve for equilibrium with a lower 

delta at the old equilibrium prices 

this guy at the old prices a would now shift and try to 

demand more of good  

but if he demanded more of good  that would mean too much 

demand for good  and the only way to clear the 


price of good  is to raise the price p 

but if you raise p holding p fixed 

thats just p over p 

so the interest rate so the interest rate has to go 

up 

so thats your argument made formal 

so thats his impatience theory 

thats the main determinant of interest according to fisher 


whats the second one 

he says suppose people are more optimistic about 

ei 

everybody thinks the worlds going to be much better next 

year 

were going to have more endowments 

what do you think is going to happen to the interest rate 

the real interest rate somebody else 

itll decrease  

itll what  

decrease  

decrease why  

because youre expecting things to be  

 

signifies people will save less 

to save less or to save  


so lets think of good x 

if people thought they were going to be richer at the old 

prices what would they do today for x demand more or 

less today 

the rate would go up  

yeah the right answer is  

he said down but lets just figure out why 

they demand more b 

so the reason i gave the formal argument  

because you can get confused here 

so lets just do the intuitive one 

so you had the idea back there of the intuitive one 

you just got it backward but you were on the right 

track 

the point is theres going to be so much stuff around for 

people to eat tomorrow youve got to get them to want 

to eat all that extra stuff tomorrow 

so you have to give them an incentive to want to eat all 

that extra stuff tomorrow so you have to raise the 

interest rate not lower it 

so you had the right idea the wrong conclusion 

now how can you actually give a formal proof of that so you 

know youre not confused 

again like his question at the old prices whats going 

to happen to the demand for x 

at the old prices since youre going to be so 

rich in the future you think youre just 

incredibly rich now so of course youre going to 

consume more today 

so theres going to be more demand today and the endowment 

today hasnt changed 

so theres going to be more demand today with the same 

endowment today so therefore in order to clear 

the market today youre going to have to raise p 

relative to p so the interest rates got to go up 


so is that clear 

its a little surprising so let me say that again 

if you increase the endowments tomorrow the supply today of 

goods hasnt changed but people are richer tomorrow 

so clearly theyre going to consume this fraction of their 

wealth 

their wealth is up 

you tell anybody youre going to be rich 

next year 

youre going to be worth a fortune 

the normal person cobbdouglas person 

is going to consume more stuff today anticipating that hes 

going to be so rich tomorrow 

hes going to borrow against tomorrows wealth 

and so therefore in order to clear todays 

market where the supply hasnt changed 

with all these people trying eat more today you have to raise 

todays price relative to tomorrow 

thats raise the real interest rate 

so whats a third example 

this is fishers most famous one 

suppose you transfer money transfer wealth 

from poor to rich 

what would happen 

we have to make an extra assumption here 

fisher felt that the people who were rich were rich because they 

were patient 

they could charge interest and get lots of money 

so if you change wealth you take away some money from the 


poor 

thats whats happened in the american economy over the last 

 or  years 

the rich have gotten richer and the poor are pretty much back 

where they were before 

so suppose the rich get rich at the expense of the poor 

whats that going to do to the real rate of interest 

illhang on a second 

yep 

that would make it  

thats going to lower  

why is that 

b 

so theres an intuitive way of saying it  


is his which is that the rich because theyre patient 

are probably the lenders 

now theyre even more willing to lend and so the interest rate 

has to go down to get these other people to borrow 

a formal way of saying it is that if you transfer money from 

the rich poor 

to the poor rich 

that means the poor guys the rich guys always consume a 

higher proportion in the future because theyre more patient 

so a more patient guy will consume more in the future 

so if you take away wealth from an impatient guy and give it to 

a patient guy youre going to increase the 

the economys going to be more in the hands of the patient 

people and so the patient peoplethe 


mix is going to change 

people on average are more patient than they were before so 

on average in the economy theyre going to consume less 

than they were of todays good and so the shift is going to be 

in this direction right 

because youve made people a lot of them impatient 

a lot of patient youve increased the patient 

ones and decreased the impatient ones 

so in balance youre going to decrease demand today because it 


was the impatient ones who wanted to eat today and the 

other guys were willing to wait 

now the guys who arent willing to wait these guys dont have 

any money 

theyre the ones doing all the consuming today and now they 

cant afford to do much consuming so youre going to 

reduce consumption today 

so to get the market to clear again you have to lower the 

interest rate this time 

so those are three famous conclusions of fisher 

more impatient people higher interest rate 

more optimistic about the future higher interest rate 

transfers from the poor to the rich lower interest rate 

so what happens to the stock market in this case 

suppose people are more impatient 

does the stock market go up or down 


down  

down because the stock market  

is just this the real interest rate times 

the dividends 

so i havent told you the dividends changed 

so if the dividends are the same and the real interest rate 

has gone up the stock market has gone down 

suppose people are more optimistic about the future 

so not about the stocks producing more 

but about whether theres more stuff in the world 

their own endowments will be bigger 


the stock market is going to go down 

that ones a little subtler because they could be optimistic 

about the stocks producing more so thats ambiguous 

so lets do the third 

suppose you transfer wealth from the poor to the rich 

whats going to happen to the stock market 

its going to go up 

so what happened in the last  years 

the rich got richer the poor got poorer 

the interest rates got lower and lower and the stock market 

got higher and higher just as fisher would have said 

so i want to now end with just fisher and shakespeare 

so im going to go over just a couple minutes 

maybe ill have to start with shakespeare 

so fishers theory of interest as i said 

was making sense of thousands of years of confusion 

so the idea is that interest is nothing other 

you shouldnt think of nominal interest 

people look through all that 

they look at the real rate of interest and the real rate of 

interest is just the ratio of two prices just like everything 

else in equilibrium so therefore there is no such 

thing as its an important price like 

anything else but maybe i forgot to say it 

theres no such thing as a just price 


the price in fact that equilibrium finds is the 

best price because thats the price thats going to lead new 

firms and inventors to use technologies that help the 

economy as opposed to hurting the economy and wasting 

resources 

so the price that the market finds is the just price and the 

real rate of interest is the right real rate of interest 

provided that people are rational and see through this 

veil 

so why is it that the real rate of interest is typically 


positive 

well its because as i said people are impatient 

and these different reasons 

now fisher said one other reason that screws up the real 

rate of interest is people sometimes get confused by 

inflation 

so this is an aside 

he said that all contracts should be inflation indexed 

and he forced his yale secretary and his secretaries at 

his company to change their contracts 

i guess his yale secretary is probably wrong 

the secretaries at his business remington 

he forced them to accept deals where their wage was indexed to 

inflation 

and of course the great depression happened and all of 

the prices collapsed and so all his secretaries got 

less money out of the deal so he wasnt too popular with them 

either 

he says impatience is a fundamental attribute of human 

nature 

as long as people like things today rather than tomorrow 

theres going to be interest 

so interest is as it were impatience 

crystallized into a market rate and the reasons for impatience 

are this foresight lack of foresight 

possibility of dying and then he talks about self control and 

stuff like that the greater the foresight 

etcetera 

now he has this racist view of the world which i think is 

worth mentioning 

so he compares the scotch and the irish so the scotch are 

patient the irish are totally impatient no selfcontrol and 


it gets worse and worse 

i cant show you all of this 

so holland scotland england france these are all 

the places his family was probably from 

theyre incredibly patient 

theyre wonderful 

theyve got low rates of interest incredibly thrifty 

people 

then you look at all these other dreadful people 

chinese indians blacks java southerners 

american indians and then greeks and italians he mentions 

later hopeless high rates of 

interest incredibly impatient 

so anyway the patient accumulate wealth and by waiting 

and lending they make production possible 

because the people with all the good ideas where are they going 

to get the money to produce 

theyre going to get it out of the patient people who are 

willing to wait 

if you can wait should i talk for five more minutes or do you 

need to go
