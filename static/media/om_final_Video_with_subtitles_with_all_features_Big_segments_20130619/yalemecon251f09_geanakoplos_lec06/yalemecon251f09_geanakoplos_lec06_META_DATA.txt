Description
Building on the general equilibrium setup solved in the last week, this 
lecture looks in depth at the relationships between productivity, patience, 
prices, allocations, and nominal and real interest rates. The solutions 
are given to three of Fisher's famous examples: What happens to interest 
rates when people become more or less patient? What happens when they expect 
to receive windfall riches sometime in the future? And, what happens when 
wealth in an economy is redistributed from the poor to the rich?
