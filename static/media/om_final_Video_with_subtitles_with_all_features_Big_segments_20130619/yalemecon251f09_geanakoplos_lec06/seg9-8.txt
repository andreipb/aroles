down  

down because the stock market  

is just this the real interest rate times 

the dividends 

so i havent told you the dividends changed 

so if the dividends are the same and the real interest rate 

has gone up the stock market has gone down 

suppose people are more optimistic about the future 

so not about the stocks producing more 

but about whether theres more stuff in the world 

their own endowments will be bigger 


the stock market is going to go down 

that ones a little subtler because they could be optimistic 

about the stocks producing more so thats ambiguous 

so lets do the third 

suppose you transfer wealth from the poor to the rich 

whats going to happen to the stock market 

its going to go up 

so what happened in the last  years 

the rich got richer the poor got poorer 

the interest rates got lower and lower and the stock market 

got higher and higher just as fisher would have said 

so i want to now end with just fisher and shakespeare 

so im going to go over just a couple minutes 

maybe ill have to start with shakespeare 

so fishers theory of interest as i said 

was making sense of thousands of years of confusion 

so the idea is that interest is nothing other 

you shouldnt think of nominal interest 

people look through all that 

they look at the real rate of interest and the real rate of 

interest is just the ratio of two prices just like everything 

else in equilibrium so therefore there is no such 

thing as its an important price like 

anything else but maybe i forgot to say it 

theres no such thing as a just price 


the price in fact that equilibrium finds is the 

best price because thats the price thats going to lead new 

firms and inventors to use technologies that help the 

economy as opposed to hurting the economy and wasting 

resources 

so the price that the market finds is the just price and the 

real rate of interest is the right real rate of interest 

provided that people are rational and see through this 

veil 

so why is it that the real rate of interest is typically 


positive 

well its because as i said people are impatient 

and these different reasons 

now fisher said one other reason that screws up the real 

rate of interest is people sometimes get confused by 

inflation 

so this is an aside 

he said that all contracts should be inflation indexed 

and he forced his yale secretary and his secretaries at 

his company to change their contracts 

i guess his yale secretary is probably wrong 

the secretaries at his business remington 

he forced them to accept deals where their wage was indexed to 

inflation 

and of course the great depression happened and all of 

the prices collapsed and so all his secretaries got 

less money out of the deal so he wasnt too popular with them 

either 

he says impatience is a fundamental attribute of human 

nature 

as long as people like things today rather than tomorrow 

theres going to be interest 

so interest is as it were impatience 

crystallized into a market rate and the reasons for impatience 

are this foresight lack of foresight 

possibility of dying and then he talks about self control and 

stuff like that the greater the foresight 

etcetera 

now he has this racist view of the world which i think is 

worth mentioning 

so he compares the scotch and the irish so the scotch are 

patient the irish are totally impatient no selfcontrol and 


it gets worse and worse 

i cant show you all of this 

so holland scotland england france these are all 

the places his family was probably from 

theyre incredibly patient 

theyre wonderful 

theyve got low rates of interest incredibly thrifty 

people 

then you look at all these other dreadful people 

chinese indians blacks java southerners 

american indians and then greeks and italians he mentions 

later hopeless high rates of 

interest incredibly impatient 

so anyway the patient accumulate wealth and by waiting 

and lending they make production possible 

because the people with all the good ideas where are they going 

to get the money to produce 

theyre going to get it out of the patient people who are 

willing to wait 

if you can wait should i talk for five more minutes or do you 

need to go
