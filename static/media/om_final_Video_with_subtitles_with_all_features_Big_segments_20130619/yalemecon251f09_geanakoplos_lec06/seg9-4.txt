do you think its standard to have the real interest rate be 

under  

so why is it under  

whats going on now that would make that happen 

yep 

the federal reserve wants to  

investment 

ah ha  

the federal reserve has cut the interest rate 

the nominal interest rate that it lends at to close to  

lets say to  percent on the  year bond to  on the  month 

thing 

so the reason theyre saying theyre doing that is to 

stimulate investment 

thats what they teach you in macro keynesian 

stimulate investment 

were going to find out that thats not the reason theyre 

doing it at all 

the reason the federal reserve is cutting the interest rate to 

almost zero is to just give money away to the banks 

and why it that 

well when you put your money and deposit it in the bank 


youre getting almost no interest 

so the banks the big banks have got all 

these deposits and people dont change what they do 

they just leave their money in the banks getting no interest 

so the banks have the money for free and they can make money 

with it 

so normally theyd have to pay  percent interest or something 

and that would be expensive for them 


and that expense is a big part of their expenses 

they dont have it anymore 

so were going to come back to that whats really going on 

today but thats whats going on 

but anyway the point is the nominal interest rate is somehow 

controlled by the fed 

thats why we dont have a theory of it 

were not going to do macro in this course 

so fisher doesnt have a theory of the nominal interest rate 

of inflation but he does tell you 

given inflation and the nominal interest rate 

thats determining a real interest rate 

and people should look through that 

so now they should say this is sort of the keynesian 

part they should realize that 

actually an apple today if you just sort of put it in the bank 

you get less than an apple in the future so you should spend 

it and do something with it 

thats the keynesian idea so peoplewhy fritter away 


part of your apple do something with it 

thats why its supposed to stimulate demand and activity 

today 

so the point is thats how you calculate the 

real rate of interest and shockingly its negative and 

its hardly ever negative but it can be negative 

are there any questions about this no arbitrage business 

all right so lets do one more trick here a fisher thing 

so lets go back to the equilibrium with q  

 and q   

suppose china offered to lend money lend us dollars at a  

percent interest 

would that be a great deal 

would people rush to do that 

this is the equilibrium we solved over here already 

so is that a great deal 

would that upset the equilibrium 

would anyone bother to take the chinese deal if they lent at  

percent interest they were offering to do that 



what 

no  

professor john they wouldnt take it 

were back here 

whats the nominal interest rate in this economy 

 percent  

professor john  percent interest 

so if you want to borrow in this economy from another 

american you have to give the guy  percent interest 

here the chinese are offering to lend you at  percent 


interest 

so yes everyone would rush to take the thing and that would 

have a big effect on what the equilibrium was if the chinese 

were willing to lend money at such a low rate of interest 

lets try another question 

suppose you invented a technology new technology 

new technology turns  unit  apple today 

into  apples tomorrow 

is this something people would rush to do or not 

suppose some inventor figured out how to do that 

would he rush to do it 

could it be used to help the economy 

so lets put it this way 

could this new technology be used to make a pareto 

improvement everybody better off 

yep 

thats no because an apple tomorrow  

worth less than half of an apple today 

its worth a third of an apple today so no one would want to 

do that 

professor john so thats exactly the right 

answer 

actually youre answering two questions 

i asked two questions 

one is could it be used to help the economy make everybody 

better off 

if a social planner was in charge of things and the chinese 

invented this new technology or some american in alaska 

invented this new technology should the government use the 

technology and could it use the technology to make everybody 

better off and the answer to that is no 

and then the answer to a second question issuppose the guy in 


alaska discovered it himself 

he couldnt care less about the pareto improvement and helping 

other guys or the american planners or anything 

he just wanted to make a profit for himself 

would he make a profit 

the answer is no because the real prices 

fisher would say are  and a third and no matter 

how you look at it the interest rate is  

hes losing money because hes giving something 


up thats worth  and hes getting something thats only 

worth  thirds 

so hed be losing money to do it 

hed lose money 

so we could prove that even 

so the answer is no 

thats the first question and nobody would do it anyway 

and fortunately nobody would choose to do itchoose to use 

itbecause it loses money 

so those are two separate questions 

could it be used and would any individual choose to do it 

would it be good for the society and would any individual 


choose to do it 

the answers happen to agree here 

so why cant it be used as a pareto improvement 

whats the proof of this that it cant be 

the answers no 

whats the proof 

well the proof is that if it did 

if in the end it led to an allocation 

xhata lets call it xtilde 

a xtildea 

and xtildeb xtildeb that 

made everyone better off 

then well we give their old proof 

then what 

it means that p xtildea 

p xtildea is bigger 

than what 

p ehata 

all right thats what you have in the fisher economy 

p ehata and similarly p 

xtildeb p 

xtildeb is bigger than p 

ehatb p 

ehatb 

so why is that 

because in this fisher economy the general equilibrium 

if this allocation really made a better off than what hes 

gotten than  third and  

he would have chosen it 


and b she would have chosen her thing if it was better than 

 thirds and  

so clearly they must have been too expensive for those two to 

choose because they were rationally choosing the right 

thing given what they could afford 

so then you just add the stuff up 

you add and you find that total consumption value is bigger than 

total endowment value 

thats in the fisher economy but weve changed the fisher 

economy because now weve added this technology which took away 

some of the first good and made it into the second good 

but that technology just lost money 

which is bigger than total value in new technology economy 

right 

and so thats a contradiction because the consumption of this 

however the new technology got used in the end the total 

consumption of the people had to be the total of what there was 

and what was produced in the economy 

the value after the new technology is introduced in that 

new economy has only gone down compared to the fisher economy 

and the fisher economy value of endowments must have been less 

than this brilliant new allocation 

and thats a contradiction because this new allocation has 

to add up to the stuff thats there in the new technology 

economy 

so thats how we know that no new technology could possibly 

make everybody better off and we know trivially it makes 


everyone better off if and only if it makes a profit 

so if and only if it makes a profit can it be used to make 

everybody better off and amazingly 

in a free market economy people are going to use it if 

and only if it makes a profit 

so theyre going to use it if and only if its a good thing 

for the economy 

so thats the basic laissezfaire argumentthat 

there are new discoveries all the time 

every other day somebodys thinking of something new 

are we going to use it 

should we use it 

is it something we need to read about in the papers and use 

well there are a whole bunch of people 

the discoverers themselves theyre going to talk to their 

business friends and theyre going to say 

do you want to lend me the money to get this thing 

going and all of them are going to do this profit 

calculation 

if they decide it loses money theyre not going to do it
