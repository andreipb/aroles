you will see that we can do positive work 

and we can do negative work 

and that has to do with this dot product 

work and energy are dot products 

i could do an extremely simple example with you 

the simplest that i can think of 

perhaps its almost an insult its not meant that way 

suppose we have a dot b 

and a is the one that you really have on the blackboard there 

right here thats a 

but b is just two y roof 

two y roof thats all it is 

well what is a dot b 

a dot b theres no x component of b 

so that becomes zero this term becomes zero 

there is only a y component of b 

so it is minus five times plus two 

so i get minus ten because there was no z component 

simple as that so its minus ten 

i can give you another example example two 

suppose a itself is the unit vector in the y direction 


and b is the unit vector in the z direction 

then a dot b is what 

i want to hear it loud and clear 

zero 

yeah zero 

it is zero you dont even have to think about anything 

you know that these two are at  degrees 

if you want to waste your time 

and want to substitute it in here 


you will see that it comes out to be zero 

it should work because clearly a of y means 

that this this is one 

thats what it means 

and b is z that means that b of z this is one 

and all the others do not exist 

well i wish you luck with that and we now go 

to a way more difficult part of multiplication 

and that is vector multiplication 

which is called the vector product 

or also called most of the time 


i refer to it as the cross product 

the cross product is written like a cross b equals c 

its a cross very clear cross 

and i will tell you how i remember 

that is method number one 

im going to teach you just like with the dot product 

two methods 

i will tell you method number one 

which is the one that always works 

its timeconsuming but it always works 

you write down here a matrix with three rows 


the first row is x roof y roof z roof 

the second one is a of x a of y a of z 

its important if a is here first 

that that second row must be a and the third row is then b 

b of x b of y b of z 

so these six are numbers and these are the unit vectors 

i repeat this here verbatim 

you will see in a minute why i need that 

and i will do the same here 



okay and now comes the recipe 

you take you go from the upper lefthand corner 

to the one in this direction 

you multiply them all three and thats a plus sign 

so you get ay so c 

which is a cross b equals ay times bz times the x roof 

but im not going to put the x roof in yet 

because i have to subtract this one minus sign 

which has az by 

so it is minus az by and that is in the direction x 

the next one is this one 

az bx 

minus this one 

ax bz 

in the direction y 

and last but not least 

ax by 

minus ay bx 

in the direction of the unit vector z 

so this part here is what we call c of x 

its the x component of this vector 

and this we can call c of y and this we can call c of z 


so we can also write that vector then 

that c equals c of x x roof plus c of y y roof 

plus c of z z roof 

cross product of a and b 

we will have lots of exercises 

lots of chances you will have on assignment too 

to play with this a little bit 

now comes my method number two and method number two is again 

as we had with the dot product is a geometrical method 

let me try to work on this board in between 


if you know vector a and you know vector b 

and you know that the angle is theta 

then the cross product c equals a cross b 

is the magnitude of a times the magnitude of b 

times the sine of theta 

not the cosine of theta as we had before with the dot product 

it is the sine of theta 

so you can really immediately see that this will be zero 

if theta is either zero degrees or  degrees 

whereas the dot product was zero 

when the angle between them was  degrees 

this number can be larger than zero 

if the sine theta is larger than zero 

it can also be smaller than zero 

now we only have the magnitude of the vector 

and now comes the hardest part 

what is the direction of the vector 

and that is something 

that you have to engrave in your mind and not forget 

the direction is found as follows 

you take a because its first mentioned 

and you rotate a over the shortest possible angle to b 

if you had in your hand a corkscrew 


and i will show that in a minute 

then you turn the corkscrew as seen from your seats clockwise 

and the corkscrew would go into the blackboard 

and if the corkscrew goes into the blackboard 

you will see the tail of the vector 

and you will see a cross little plus sign 

and therefore we put that like so 

a cross product is always perpendicular to both a and b 

but it leaves you with two 

it can either come out of the blackboard 

or it can go in the blackboard 

and i just told you which convention to use 

and i want to show that to you 

in a way that may appeal to you more 

this is what i have used before 

on my television help sessions 

that i have given at mit 

i have an apple not an apple 

this is a tomato not a tomato 

its a potato 

 class   

i have a potato here and here is a corkscrew 


here is a corkscrew 

im going to turn the corkscrew 

as seen from your side clockwise 

and youll see that the corkscrew goes into the potato 

ini  thats the direction then of the vector 

if we had b cross a then you take b in your hands 

and you rotate it over the shortest angle to a 

now you have to rotate counterclockwise 

and when you rotate counterclockwise 

the corkscrew comes to you there you go 


and so the vector is now pointing in this direction 

and if the vector is pointing towards you 

then we would indicate that with a circle and a dot 

in other words for this vector 

b cross a would have exactly the same magnitude 

no difference but it would be coming out of the blackboard 

in other words a cross b equals minus b cross a 

whereas a dot b is the same as b dot a 

we will encounter cross products when we deal with torques 

and when we deal with angular momentum 

which is not the easiest part of  

lets take an extremely simple example 

again i dont mean to insult you with such a simple example 

but you will get chances 

more advanced chances on your assignment 

suppose i gave to vector a this x roof 

its a unit vector in the x direction 

that means a of x is one 

and a of y is zero and a of z is zero 

and suppose b is y roof 

that means b of y is one 

and b of x is zero and b of z is zero 

what now is the dot product the cross product a cross b 



well you can apply that recipe 

but its much easier to go 

to the x y z axes that we have here 

a was in the x direction the unit vector 

and b in the y direction 

i take a in my hand i rotate over the smallest angle
