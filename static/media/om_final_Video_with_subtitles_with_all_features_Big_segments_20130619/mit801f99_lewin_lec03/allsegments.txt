the bad news today is that there will be quite a bit of math 

but the good news is that we will only do it once 

and it will only take something like halfhour 

there are quantities in physics 

which are determined uniquely by one number 

mass is one of them 

temperature is one of them 

speed is one of them 

we call those scalars 

there are others where you need more than one number 

for instance on a one dimensional motion velocity 

it has a certain magnitude thats the speed 

but you also have to know 

whether it goes this way or that way 

so there has to be a direction 

velocity is a vector and acceleration is a vector 

and today were going to learn how to work with these vectors 

a vector has a length and a vector has a direction 

and thats why we actually represent it by an arrow 


we all have seen this is a vector 

remember this this is a vector 

if you look at the vector headon you see a dot 

if you look at the vector from behind you see a cross 

this is a vector 

and that will be our representation of vectors 

imagine that i am standing on the table in  

this is the table and i am standing say at point o 

and i move along a straight line from o to point p 

so i move like so 

thats why i am on the table 

and thats where you will see me when you look from  

it just so happens 

that someone is also going to move the table 

in that same amount of time from here to there 

so that means that the table will have moved down 

and so my point p will have moved down exactly the same way 

and so you will see me now at point s 


you will see me at point s in  

although i am still standing 

at the same location on the table 

the table has moved 

this is now the position of the table 

see the whole table has shifted 

now if these two motions take place simultaneously 

then what you will see from where you are sitting 

you will see me move in  from o straight line to s 

and this holds the secret behind the adding of vectors 


we say here that the vector os well put an arrow over it 

is the vector op with an arrow over it plus ps 

this defines how we add vectors 

there are various ways that you can add vectors 

suppose i have here vector a and i have here vector b 

then you can do it this way 

which i call the headtail technique 

i take b and i bring it to the head of a 

so this is b this is a vector 

and then the net result is a plus b 

this vector c equals a plus b 

thats one way of doing it 

it doesnt matter whether you take b 

the tail of b to the head of a 

or whether you take the tail of a and bring it to the head of b 

you will get the same result 

theres another way you can do it 

and i call that the parallelogram method 

here you have a 

you bring the two tails together so here is b now 

so the tails are touching 

and now you complete this parallelogram 


and now this vector c is the same sum vector 

that you have here whichever way you prefer 

you see immediately 

that a plus b is the same as b plus a 

there is no difference 

what is the meaning of a negative vector 

well a minus a equals zero 

vector a subtract from vector a equals zero 

so here is vector a 

so which vector do i have to add to get zero 

i have to add minus a 

well if you use the headtail technique 

this is a 

you have to add this vector to have zero 

so this is minus a 

and so minus a is nothing but the same as a 

but flipped over  degrees 

well use that very often 

and that brings us to the point of subtraction of vectors 


how do we subtract vectors 

so a minus b equals c 

here we have vector a and here we have 

let me write this down here and here we have vector b 

one way to look at this is the following 

you can say a minus b is a plus minus b 

and we know how to add vectors and we know what minus b is 

minus b is the same vector but flipped over 

so we put here minus b 

and so this vector now here equals a minus b 


heres vector c heres a minus b 

and of course you can do it in different ways 

you can also think of it as a plus as c plus b is a 

right you can say you can bring this to the other side 

you can say c plus b is a c plus b is a 

in other words which vector do i have to add to b to get a 

and then you have the parallelogram technique again 


there are many ways you can do it 

the headtail technique 

is perhaps the easiest and the safest 

so you can add a countless number of vectors 

one plus the other and the next one 

and you finally have the sum of five or six or seven vectors 

which then can be represented by only one 

when you add scalars for instance five and four 

then there is only one answer that is nine 

five plus four is nine 

suppose you have two vectors 

you have no information on their direction 

but you do know that the magnitude of one is four 

and the magnitude of the other is five 

thats all you know 

then the magnitude of the sum vector could be nine 


if they are both in the same direction thats the maximum 

or it could be one if they are in opposite directions 

so then you have a whole range of possibilities 

because you do not know the direction 

so the adding and the subtraction of vectors 

is way more complicated than just scalars 

as we have seen that the sum of vectors 

can be represented by one vector 

equally can we take one vector 

and we can replace it by the sum of others 

and we call that decomposition of a vector 

and thats going to be very important in  

and i want you to follow this therefore quite closely 

i have a vector which is in threedimensional space 

this is my z axis 

this is my x axis y axis and z axis 

this is the origin o and here is a point p 

and i have a vector op thats the vector 

and what i do now i project this vector 

onto the three axes x y and z 

so there we go 



each one has her or his own method of doing this 



there we are 

i call this vector vector a 



now this angle will be theta and this angle will be phi 



notice that the projection of a on the y axis has here 

a number which i call a of y 

this number is a of x and this number here is a of z 


simply a projection of that vector onto the three axes 

we now introduce what we call unit vectors 

unit vectors are always pointing in the direction 

of the positive axis 

and the unit vector in the x direction is this one 

it has a length one and we write for it x roof 

roof always means unit vector 

and this is the unit vector in the y direction 

and this is the unit vector in the z direction 

and now im going to rewrite vector a 

in terms of the three components that we have here 


so the vector a im going to write 

as a of x times x roof plus a of y times y roof 

plus a of z times z roof 

and this a of x times x is really a vector 

that runs from the origin to this point 

so we could put in that as a vector if you want to 

this makes it a vector 

this is that vector 

a of y times oh sorry it is a of x this one 

a of y times y roof is this one 

and a of z times z roof is this one 

and so these three green vectors added together 


are exactly identical to the vector op 

so we have decomposed one vector into three directions 

and we will see that very often this is of great use in  

the magnitude of the vector is 

the square root of ax squared plus ay squared plus az squared 

and so we can take a simple example 

for instance i take a vector a 

this is just an example to see this in action 

and we call a three x roof 


so a of axis is three minus five y roof plus  z roof 

so that means that its three units in this direction 

it is five units in this direction 

in the minus y direction 

and six in the plus z direction 

that makes up a vector and i call that vector a 

what is the magnitude of that vector 

which i always write down with vertical bars 

if i put two bars on one side thats always the magnitude 

or sometimes i simply leave the arrow off 


but to be always on the safe side i like this idea 

that you know its really the magnitude 

becomes the scalar when you do that 

so that would be the square root of three squared is nine 

five squared is  six squared is  

so thats the square root of  

and suppose i asked you what is theta 

its uniquely determined of course 

this vector is uniquely determined 

in threedimensional space 


so you should be able to find phi and theta 

well the cosine of theta 

see this angle here  degrees projection 

so the cosine of theta is a of z divided by a itself 

so the cosine of theta equals a of z divided by a itself 

which in our case 

would be six divided by the square root of  

and you can do fine 

its just simply a matter of manipulating some numbers 


we now come to a much more difficult part of vectors 

and that is multiplication of vectors 



were not going to need this until october but i decided 

we might as well get it over with now 

now that we introduced vectors you can add and subtract 

you might as well learn about multiplication 

its sort of the job is done its like going to the dentist 

its a little painful but its good for you 

and when its behind you the pain disappears 

so were going to talk about multiplication of vectors 


something that will not come back until october 

and later in the course 

there are two ways that we multiply vectors 

and one is called the dot product 

often also called the scalar product 

a dot b a fat dot and that is defined as it is a scalar 

a of x times b of x just a number 

plus a of y times b of y thats another number 

plus a of z times b of z thats another number 

it is a scalar 

it has no longer a direction 

that is the dot product 

so thats method number one 

thats completely legitimate and you can always use that 

there is another way to find the dot product 


depending upon what youre being given 

how the problem is presented to you 

if someone gives you the vector a and you have the vector b 

and you happen to know this angle between them 

this angle theta 

which has nothing to do with that angle theta 

its the angle between the two 

then the dot product is also the following 

and you may make an attempt to prove that 

you project the vector b on a 

this is that projection 

the length of this vector is b cosine theta 

and then the dot product 

is the magnitude of a times the magnitude of b 

times the cosine of the angle theta 


the two are completely identical 

now you may ask me you may say 

gee how do i know what theta is 

how do i know i should take theta this angle 

or maybe i should take theta this angle 

i mean what angle is a making with b 

it makes no difference 

because the cosine of this angle here 

is the same as the cosine of  degrees minus theta 

so that makes no difference 

sometimes this is faster 

depending upon how the problem is presented to you 

sometimes the other is faster 

you can immediately see by looking at this 

its easier to see than looking here 


that the dot product can be larger than zero 

it can be equal to zero and it can be smaller than zero 

a and b are by definition always positive 

they are a magnitude 

thats always determined by the cosine of theta 

if the cosine of theta is larger than zero 

well then its larger than zero 

the cosine of theta can be zero 

if the angle for theta is pi over two 

in other words if the two vectors 

are perpendicular to each other 

then the dot product is zero and if this angle theta 

is between  degrees and  degrees 

then the cosine is negative 

we will see that at work no pun implied 

when were going to deal with work in physics 


you will see that we can do positive work 

and we can do negative work 

and that has to do with this dot product 

work and energy are dot products 

i could do an extremely simple example with you 

the simplest that i can think of 

perhaps its almost an insult its not meant that way 

suppose we have a dot b 

and a is the one that you really have on the blackboard there 

right here thats a 

but b is just two y roof 

two y roof thats all it is 

well what is a dot b 

a dot b theres no x component of b 

so that becomes zero this term becomes zero 

there is only a y component of b 

so it is minus five times plus two 

so i get minus ten because there was no z component 

simple as that so its minus ten 

i can give you another example example two 

suppose a itself is the unit vector in the y direction 


and b is the unit vector in the z direction 

then a dot b is what 

i want to hear it loud and clear 

zero 

yeah zero 

it is zero you dont even have to think about anything 

you know that these two are at  degrees 

if you want to waste your time 

and want to substitute it in here 


you will see that it comes out to be zero 

it should work because clearly a of y means 

that this this is one 

thats what it means 

and b is z that means that b of z this is one 

and all the others do not exist 

well i wish you luck with that and we now go 

to a way more difficult part of multiplication 

and that is vector multiplication 

which is called the vector product 

or also called most of the time 


i refer to it as the cross product 

the cross product is written like a cross b equals c 

its a cross very clear cross 

and i will tell you how i remember 

that is method number one 

im going to teach you just like with the dot product 

two methods 

i will tell you method number one 

which is the one that always works 

its timeconsuming but it always works 

you write down here a matrix with three rows 


the first row is x roof y roof z roof 

the second one is a of x a of y a of z 

its important if a is here first 

that that second row must be a and the third row is then b 

b of x b of y b of z 

so these six are numbers and these are the unit vectors 

i repeat this here verbatim 

you will see in a minute why i need that 

and i will do the same here 



okay and now comes the recipe 

you take you go from the upper lefthand corner 

to the one in this direction 

you multiply them all three and thats a plus sign 

so you get ay so c 

which is a cross b equals ay times bz times the x roof 

but im not going to put the x roof in yet 

because i have to subtract this one minus sign 

which has az by 

so it is minus az by and that is in the direction x 

the next one is this one 

az bx 

minus this one 

ax bz 

in the direction y 

and last but not least 

ax by 

minus ay bx 

in the direction of the unit vector z 

so this part here is what we call c of x 

its the x component of this vector 

and this we can call c of y and this we can call c of z 


so we can also write that vector then 

that c equals c of x x roof plus c of y y roof 

plus c of z z roof 

cross product of a and b 

we will have lots of exercises 

lots of chances you will have on assignment too 

to play with this a little bit 

now comes my method number two and method number two is again 

as we had with the dot product is a geometrical method 

let me try to work on this board in between 


if you know vector a and you know vector b 

and you know that the angle is theta 

then the cross product c equals a cross b 

is the magnitude of a times the magnitude of b 

times the sine of theta 

not the cosine of theta as we had before with the dot product 

it is the sine of theta 

so you can really immediately see that this will be zero 

if theta is either zero degrees or  degrees 

whereas the dot product was zero 

when the angle between them was  degrees 

this number can be larger than zero 

if the sine theta is larger than zero 

it can also be smaller than zero 

now we only have the magnitude of the vector 

and now comes the hardest part 

what is the direction of the vector 

and that is something 

that you have to engrave in your mind and not forget 

the direction is found as follows 

you take a because its first mentioned 

and you rotate a over the shortest possible angle to b 

if you had in your hand a corkscrew 


and i will show that in a minute 

then you turn the corkscrew as seen from your seats clockwise 

and the corkscrew would go into the blackboard 

and if the corkscrew goes into the blackboard 

you will see the tail of the vector 

and you will see a cross little plus sign 

and therefore we put that like so 

a cross product is always perpendicular to both a and b 

but it leaves you with two 

it can either come out of the blackboard 

or it can go in the blackboard 

and i just told you which convention to use 

and i want to show that to you 

in a way that may appeal to you more 

this is what i have used before 

on my television help sessions 

that i have given at mit 

i have an apple not an apple 

this is a tomato not a tomato 

its a potato 

 class   

i have a potato here and here is a corkscrew 


here is a corkscrew 

im going to turn the corkscrew 

as seen from your side clockwise 

and youll see that the corkscrew goes into the potato 

ini  thats the direction then of the vector 

if we had b cross a then you take b in your hands 

and you rotate it over the shortest angle to a 

now you have to rotate counterclockwise 

and when you rotate counterclockwise 

the corkscrew comes to you there you go 


and so the vector is now pointing in this direction 

and if the vector is pointing towards you 

then we would indicate that with a circle and a dot 

in other words for this vector 

b cross a would have exactly the same magnitude 

no difference but it would be coming out of the blackboard 

in other words a cross b equals minus b cross a 

whereas a dot b is the same as b dot a 

we will encounter cross products when we deal with torques 

and when we deal with angular momentum 

which is not the easiest part of  

lets take an extremely simple example 

again i dont mean to insult you with such a simple example 

but you will get chances 

more advanced chances on your assignment 

suppose i gave to vector a this x roof 

its a unit vector in the x direction 

that means a of x is one 

and a of y is zero and a of z is zero 

and suppose b is y roof 

that means b of y is one 

and b of x is zero and b of z is zero 

what now is the dot product the cross product a cross b 



well you can apply that recipe 

but its much easier to go 

to the x y z axes that we have here 

a was in the x direction the unit vector 

and b in the y direction 

i take a in my hand i rotate over the smallest angle 


which is  degrees to y and my corkscrew will go up 

so i know the whole thing already 

i know that this cross product must be z roof 

the magnitude must be one 

thats immediately clear 

but i immediately have the direction 

by using the corkscrew rule 

now if youre very smart 

you may say aha you find plus z 

only because you have used this coordinate system 

if this axis had been x and this one had been y 

then the cross product of x and y would be 

in the minus z direction 

yeah youre right 

but if you ever do that i will killi you 

 class   

you will always always have to work 


with what we call a right handed coordinate system 

and a righthanded coordinate system by definition 

is one whereby the cross product 

of x with y is z and not y minus z 

so whenever you get in the future involved 

with cross products and torques and angular momentum 

always make yourself an xyz diagram 

for which x cross y is z 


never ever make it such that x cross y is minus z 

youre going to hang yourself 

for one thing that wouldnt work anymore 

so be very very careful 

you must work if you use the righthand corkscrew rule 

make sure you work with the righthanded coordinate system 

all right now the worst part is over 

and now i would like to write down for you 

we pick up some of the fruits now 

although it will penetrate slowly 

i want to write down for you equations for a moving particle 


a moving object in threedimensional space 

very complicated motion 

which i can hardly imagine what its like 

it is a point that is going to move around in space 

and it is this point p 

this point p is going to move around in space 

and i call this vector op i call that now vector r 

and i give it a subindex t 

which indicates its changing with time 

i call this location a of y i am going to call that y of t 

its changing with time 

i call this x of t its going to change with time 

and i call this point z of t 

which is going to change with time 

because point p is going to move 

and so im going to write down the vector r 

in its most general form that i can do that 

r which changes with time 

is now x of t which is the same as a over x there before 

times x roof plus y of t 

y roof plus z of t z roof 


i have decomposed my vector r into three independent vectors 

each one of those change with time 

what is the velocity of this particle 

well the velocity is the first derivative of the position 

so that it is dr dt 

so there we go first the derivative of this one 

which is dx dt x roof 

i am going to write for dx dt x dot because i am lazy 

and i am going to write for dx dt squared x double dots 

its often done but not in your book 

but it is a notation that i will often use 

because otherwise the equations look so clumsy 

plus y dot times y roof plus z dot times z roof 

so z dot is the dzdt 

what is the acceleration as a function of time 

well the acceleration as a function of time 

equals dvdt 

so thats the section derivative of x versus time 

and so that becomes x double dot times x roof 

plus y double dot times y roof plus z double dot times z roof 

and look what we have now accomplished 

it looks like minor but its going to be big later on 

we have a point p going in threedimensional space 

and here we have the entire behavior of the object 

as it moves its projection along the x axis 

this is the position this is its velocity 

and this is its acceleration 

and here you can see the entire behavior on the z axis 

this is the position on the z axis 

this is the velocity component in the z direction 


and this is the acceleration on the z axis 

and here you have the y 

in other words we have now the threedimensional motion 

we have cut into three onedimensional motions 

this is a onedimensional motion 

this is behavior only along the x axis 

and this is a behavior only along the y axis 

and this is a behavior only along the z axis 

and the three together make up 

the actual motion of that particle 

what have we gained now 

it looks like this looks like a mathematical zoo 

you would say well if this is what it is going to be like 

its going to be hell 

well not quite 

in fact its going to help you a great deal 

first of all if i throw up a tennis ball in class 


like this then the whole trajectory is 

the whole trajectory is in one plane 

in the vertical plane 

so even though it is in three dimensions 

we can always represent it by two axes by two dimensionally 

a y axis and an x axis 

so already the threedimensional problem 

often becomes a twodimensional problem 

we will with great success analyze these trajectories 

by decomposing this very complicated motion 

imagine what an incredibly complicated arc that is 

and yet we are going to decompose it 

into a motion in the x direction 

which lives a life of its own 

independent of the motion in the y direction 

which lives a life of itsi own 


and of course you always have to combine the two 

to know what the particle is doing 

we know the equations so well from our last lecture 

from onedimensional motion with constant acceleration 

the first line tells you 

what the x position is as a function of time 

the index t tells you that it is changing with time 

it is the position at t equals zero 

plus the velocity at t equals zero 

times t plus onehalf ax t squared 

if there is an acceleration in the x direction 

the velocity immediately comes 

from taking the derivative of this function 

and the acceleration comes 

from taking the derivative of this function 

now if we have a motion which is more complicated 

which reaches out to two or three dimensions 

we can decompose the motion in three perpendicular axes 

and you can replace every x here by a y 

which gives you the entire behavior in the y direction 

and if you want to know the behavior in the z direction 

you replace every x here by z 

and then you have decomposed the motion in three directions 

each of them are linear 

and thats what i want to do now 

im going to throw up an object golf ball or an apple in  


and we know that its in the vertical plane so we have 

we only deal with a twodimensional problem 

this being 

i call this my x axis and im going to call this my y axis 

i call this increasing value of x 

and i call this increasing value of y 

i could have called thisi increasing value of y 

today i have decided to call thisi increasing value of y 

i am free in that choice 

i throw up an object at a certain angle 

and i see a motion like this boing 

and it comes back to the ground 

my initial speed when i threw it was v zero 

and the angle here is alpha 

the x component of that initial velocity 

is v zero cosine alpha 

and the y component equals v zero sine alpha 

so thats the begins velocity of the x direction 


this is the begins velocity in the y direction 

a little later in time that object is here at point p 

and this is now the position vector 

which we have called r of t its this vector 

thats the vector that is moving through space 

at this moment in time x of t is here 

and at this moment in time y of t is here 

and now youre going to see for the first time 

the big gain by the way that we have divided the two axes 

which live an independent life 

first x 

i want to know everything about x that there has to be known 

i want to know where it is at any moment in time 

velocity and the acceleration only in x 

first i want to know that at t   

well at t   i look there 

x zero thats the i can choose that to be zero 

so i can say x zero is zero thats my free choice 

now i need v zero x what is the velocity 

the velocity at t   which we have called v zero x 

is this velocity v zero cosine alpha 

and its not going to change 

why is it not going to change 

because there is no a of x so this term here is zero 

we only have this one 

so at all moments in time 

the velocity in the x direction is v zero cosine alpha 

and the a of x equals zero 



now i want to do the same in the x direction for time t 

well at time t i look there at the first equation 

there it is x zero is zero 

i know v zero x that is v zero cosine alpha 

so x of t is v zero cosine alpha times t 

but there is no acceleration so thats it 

what is vx of t 

the velocity in the x direction at any moment in time 

that is that equation that is simply v zero x 

it is not changing in time 

because there is no acceleration 

so the initial velocity at t zero is the same 


as t seconds later and the acceleration is zero 

now were going to do this for the y direction 

and now you begin to see the gain for the decomposition 

in the y direction we change the x by y 

and so we do it first at t   

so look there 

this becomes y zero i call that zero 

i can always call my origin zero 


i get v zero y times t 

well v zero y is this quantity 

is v zero sine alpha v zero sine alpha 

this is v zero sine alpha 

that is the velocity at time zero and this is zero 

at time zero this is zero at time zero 

what is the acceleration in the y direction at time zero 

what is the acceleration that has to do with gravity 

there is no acceleration in the x direction 

but you better believe that there is one in the y direction 

so only when we deal with the y equations 

does this acceleration come in 

not at all when we deal with the x direction 


well if we call the acceleration due to gravity 

g equals plus  and i always call it g 

what would be the acceleration in the y direction 

given the fact that i call this increasing value of y 

minus  

minus  which i will also say 

always call minus g because my g is always positive 

so it is minus g 

so that tells the story of t equals zero in the y direction 

and now we have to complete it at time t equals t 

at time t equals t we have the first line there 

y zero is zero 

so we have y as a function of time y zero is zero 


so we dont have to work with that 

where is my so this is zero so i get v zero y times t 

so i get v zero sine alpha times t 

plus onehalf but it is minus onehalf g t squared 

and now i get the velocity in the y direction at time t 

that is my second line 

that is going to be v zero sine alpha minus g t 

and the acceleration in the y direction at any moment in time 


equals minus g 

and now i have done all i can 

to completely decompose this complicated motion 

into two entirely independent onedimensional motions 

and the next lecture 

were going to use this again and again and again and again 

this lecture is not over yet but i want you to know 

that this is what were going to apply 

for many lectures to come 

the decomposition of a complicated trajectory 

into two simple ones 

now when you look at this 


there is something quite remarkable 

and the remarkable thing 

is that the velocity in the x direction 

throughout this whole trajectory 

if there is no air draft if there is no friction 

is not changing 

its only the velocity in the y direction that is changing 

it means if i throw up this golf ball 

i throw it up like this 

and it has a certain component in x direction 

a certain velocity 

if i move myself with exactly that same velocity 

with exactly the same horizontal velocity 

i could catch the ball here 

it would have to come back exactly in my hands 

that is because there is only an acceleration in the y direction 

but the motion in the y direction 

is completely independent of the x direction 

the x direction doesnt even know 

whats going on with the y direction 

in the x direction if i throw an object like this 

the x direction simply very boringly 

moves with a constant velocity 

there is no time dependence 

and the y direction on its own does its own thing 

it goes up comes to a halt and it stops 

and of course the actual motion is the sum 

the superposition of the two 

we have tried to find a way 

to demonstrate this quite bizarre behavior 

which is not so intuitive 


that the x direction really lives a life of its own 

and the way we want to do that is as follows 

we have here a golf ball 

a gun we can shoot up the golf ball 

and we do that in such a way 

that the golf ball if we do it correctly 

exactly comes back here 

thats not easy that takes hours and hours of adjustments 


the golf ball goes up and comes back here 

not here not here not there thats easy 

you can shoot it up a little at an angle 

and the golf ball will come back here 

once we have achieved that 

that the golf ball will come back there 

then im going to give this cart a push 

and the moment that it passes through this switch 

the golf ball will fire 

so that the golf ball will go straight up 

as seen from the cart 

but it has a horizontal velocity 

which is exactly the same horizontal velocity as the cart 

so the cart are like my hands 

as the golf ball goes like this 

the cart stays always exactly under the golf ball 

always exactly under the golf ball 

and if all works well 

the ball ends up exactly on the cart again 

let me first show you 

otherwise if that doesnt work of course its all over 

that if we shoot the ball straight up 

that it comes back here 

if it doesnt do that 

i dont even have to try this more complicated experiment 

so heres the golf ball 

im going to fire the gun now 



close close 

reasonably close 


well since its only reasonably close perhaps 

 class   

perhaps it would help if we give it a little bit of leeway 

there goes the gun 

here comes the ball 

and this is just in case 

tape it down 

so as im going to push this now give it a push 

the gun will be triggered 

when the middle of the car is here 

youve seen how high that ball goes 

so that ball will go  makes whooshing   

and depending upon how hard i push it
