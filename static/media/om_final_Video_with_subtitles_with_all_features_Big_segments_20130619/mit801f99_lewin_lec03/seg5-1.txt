the bad news today is that there will be quite a bit of math 

but the good news is that we will only do it once 

and it will only take something like halfhour 

there are quantities in physics 

which are determined uniquely by one number 

mass is one of them 

temperature is one of them 

speed is one of them 

we call those scalars 

there are others where you need more than one number 

for instance on a one dimensional motion velocity 

it has a certain magnitude thats the speed 

but you also have to know 

whether it goes this way or that way 

so there has to be a direction 

velocity is a vector and acceleration is a vector 

and today were going to learn how to work with these vectors 

a vector has a length and a vector has a direction 

and thats why we actually represent it by an arrow 


we all have seen this is a vector 

remember this this is a vector 

if you look at the vector headon you see a dot 

if you look at the vector from behind you see a cross 

this is a vector 

and that will be our representation of vectors 

imagine that i am standing on the table in  

this is the table and i am standing say at point o 

and i move along a straight line from o to point p 

so i move like so 

thats why i am on the table 

and thats where you will see me when you look from  

it just so happens 

that someone is also going to move the table 

in that same amount of time from here to there 

so that means that the table will have moved down 

and so my point p will have moved down exactly the same way 

and so you will see me now at point s 


you will see me at point s in  

although i am still standing 

at the same location on the table 

the table has moved 

this is now the position of the table 

see the whole table has shifted 

now if these two motions take place simultaneously 

then what you will see from where you are sitting 

you will see me move in  from o straight line to s 

and this holds the secret behind the adding of vectors 


we say here that the vector os well put an arrow over it 

is the vector op with an arrow over it plus ps 

this defines how we add vectors 

there are various ways that you can add vectors 

suppose i have here vector a and i have here vector b 

then you can do it this way 

which i call the headtail technique 

i take b and i bring it to the head of a 

so this is b this is a vector 

and then the net result is a plus b 

this vector c equals a plus b 

thats one way of doing it 

it doesnt matter whether you take b 

the tail of b to the head of a 

or whether you take the tail of a and bring it to the head of b 

you will get the same result 

theres another way you can do it 

and i call that the parallelogram method 

here you have a 

you bring the two tails together so here is b now 

so the tails are touching 

and now you complete this parallelogram 


and now this vector c is the same sum vector 

that you have here whichever way you prefer 

you see immediately 

that a plus b is the same as b plus a 

there is no difference 

what is the meaning of a negative vector 

well a minus a equals zero 

vector a subtract from vector a equals zero 

so here is vector a 

so which vector do i have to add to get zero 

i have to add minus a 

well if you use the headtail technique 

this is a 

you have to add this vector to have zero 

so this is minus a 

and so minus a is nothing but the same as a 

but flipped over  degrees 

well use that very often 

and that brings us to the point of subtraction of vectors 


how do we subtract vectors 

so a minus b equals c 

here we have vector a and here we have 

let me write this down here and here we have vector b 

one way to look at this is the following 

you can say a minus b is a plus minus b 

and we know how to add vectors and we know what minus b is 

minus b is the same vector but flipped over 

so we put here minus b 

and so this vector now here equals a minus b 


heres vector c heres a minus b 

and of course you can do it in different ways 

you can also think of it as a plus as c plus b is a 

right you can say you can bring this to the other side 

you can say c plus b is a c plus b is a 

in other words which vector do i have to add to b to get a 

and then you have the parallelogram technique again 


there are many ways you can do it 

the headtail technique 

is perhaps the easiest and the safest 

so you can add a countless number of vectors 

one plus the other and the next one 

and you finally have the sum of five or six or seven vectors 

which then can be represented by only one 

when you add scalars for instance five and four 

then there is only one answer that is nine 

five plus four is nine 

suppose you have two vectors 

you have no information on their direction 

but you do know that the magnitude of one is four 

and the magnitude of the other is five 

thats all you know 

then the magnitude of the sum vector could be nine 


if they are both in the same direction thats the maximum 

or it could be one if they are in opposite directions 

so then you have a whole range of possibilities 

because you do not know the direction 

so the adding and the subtraction of vectors 

is way more complicated than just scalars 

as we have seen that the sum of vectors 

can be represented by one vector 

equally can we take one vector 

and we can replace it by the sum of others 

and we call that decomposition of a vector 

and thats going to be very important in  

and i want you to follow this therefore quite closely 

i have a vector which is in threedimensional space 

this is my z axis 

this is my x axis y axis and z axis 

this is the origin o and here is a point p 

and i have a vector op thats the vector 

and what i do now i project this vector 

onto the three axes x y and z 

so there we go 



each one has her or his own method of doing this 



there we are 

i call this vector vector a 



now this angle will be theta and this angle will be phi 



notice that the projection of a on the y axis has here 

a number which i call a of y 

this number is a of x and this number here is a of z 


simply a projection of that vector onto the three axes 

we now introduce what we call unit vectors 

unit vectors are always pointing in the direction 

of the positive axis 

and the unit vector in the x direction is this one 

it has a length one and we write for it x roof 

roof always means unit vector 

and this is the unit vector in the y direction 

and this is the unit vector in the z direction 

and now im going to rewrite vector a 

in terms of the three components that we have here
