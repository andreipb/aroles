so the vector a im going to write 

as a of x times x roof plus a of y times y roof 

plus a of z times z roof 

and this a of x times x is really a vector 

that runs from the origin to this point 

so we could put in that as a vector if you want to 

this makes it a vector 

this is that vector 

a of y times oh sorry it is a of x this one 

a of y times y roof is this one 

and a of z times z roof is this one 

and so these three green vectors added together 


are exactly identical to the vector op 

so we have decomposed one vector into three directions 

and we will see that very often this is of great use in  

the magnitude of the vector is 

the square root of ax squared plus ay squared plus az squared 

and so we can take a simple example 

for instance i take a vector a 

this is just an example to see this in action 

and we call a three x roof 


so a of axis is three minus five y roof plus  z roof 

so that means that its three units in this direction 

it is five units in this direction 

in the minus y direction 

and six in the plus z direction 

that makes up a vector and i call that vector a 

what is the magnitude of that vector 

which i always write down with vertical bars 

if i put two bars on one side thats always the magnitude 

or sometimes i simply leave the arrow off 


but to be always on the safe side i like this idea 

that you know its really the magnitude 

becomes the scalar when you do that 

so that would be the square root of three squared is nine 

five squared is  six squared is  

so thats the square root of  

and suppose i asked you what is theta 

its uniquely determined of course 

this vector is uniquely determined 

in threedimensional space 


so you should be able to find phi and theta 

well the cosine of theta 

see this angle here  degrees projection 

so the cosine of theta is a of z divided by a itself 

so the cosine of theta equals a of z divided by a itself 

which in our case 

would be six divided by the square root of  

and you can do fine 

its just simply a matter of manipulating some numbers 


we now come to a much more difficult part of vectors 

and that is multiplication of vectors 



were not going to need this until october but i decided 

we might as well get it over with now 

now that we introduced vectors you can add and subtract 

you might as well learn about multiplication 

its sort of the job is done its like going to the dentist 

its a little painful but its good for you 

and when its behind you the pain disappears 

so were going to talk about multiplication of vectors 


something that will not come back until october 

and later in the course 

there are two ways that we multiply vectors 

and one is called the dot product 

often also called the scalar product 

a dot b a fat dot and that is defined as it is a scalar 

a of x times b of x just a number 

plus a of y times b of y thats another number 

plus a of z times b of z thats another number 

it is a scalar 

it has no longer a direction 

that is the dot product 

so thats method number one 

thats completely legitimate and you can always use that 

there is another way to find the dot product 


depending upon what youre being given 

how the problem is presented to you 

if someone gives you the vector a and you have the vector b 

and you happen to know this angle between them 

this angle theta 

which has nothing to do with that angle theta 

its the angle between the two 

then the dot product is also the following 

and you may make an attempt to prove that 

you project the vector b on a 

this is that projection 

the length of this vector is b cosine theta 

and then the dot product 

is the magnitude of a times the magnitude of b 

times the cosine of the angle theta 


the two are completely identical 

now you may ask me you may say 

gee how do i know what theta is 

how do i know i should take theta this angle 

or maybe i should take theta this angle 

i mean what angle is a making with b 

it makes no difference 

because the cosine of this angle here 

is the same as the cosine of  degrees minus theta 

so that makes no difference 

sometimes this is faster 

depending upon how the problem is presented to you 

sometimes the other is faster 

you can immediately see by looking at this 

its easier to see than looking here 


that the dot product can be larger than zero 

it can be equal to zero and it can be smaller than zero 

a and b are by definition always positive 

they are a magnitude 

thats always determined by the cosine of theta 

if the cosine of theta is larger than zero 

well then its larger than zero 

the cosine of theta can be zero 

if the angle for theta is pi over two 

in other words if the two vectors 

are perpendicular to each other 

then the dot product is zero and if this angle theta 

is between  degrees and  degrees 

then the cosine is negative 

we will see that at work no pun implied 

when were going to deal with work in physics
