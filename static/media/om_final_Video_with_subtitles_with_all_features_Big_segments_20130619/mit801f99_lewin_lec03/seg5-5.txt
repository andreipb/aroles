as t seconds later and the acceleration is zero 

now were going to do this for the y direction 

and now you begin to see the gain for the decomposition 

in the y direction we change the x by y 

and so we do it first at t   

so look there 

this becomes y zero i call that zero 

i can always call my origin zero 


i get v zero y times t 

well v zero y is this quantity 

is v zero sine alpha v zero sine alpha 

this is v zero sine alpha 

that is the velocity at time zero and this is zero 

at time zero this is zero at time zero 

what is the acceleration in the y direction at time zero 

what is the acceleration that has to do with gravity 

there is no acceleration in the x direction 

but you better believe that there is one in the y direction 

so only when we deal with the y equations 

does this acceleration come in 

not at all when we deal with the x direction 


well if we call the acceleration due to gravity 

g equals plus  and i always call it g 

what would be the acceleration in the y direction 

given the fact that i call this increasing value of y 

minus  

minus  which i will also say 

always call minus g because my g is always positive 

so it is minus g 

so that tells the story of t equals zero in the y direction 

and now we have to complete it at time t equals t 

at time t equals t we have the first line there 

y zero is zero 

so we have y as a function of time y zero is zero 


so we dont have to work with that 

where is my so this is zero so i get v zero y times t 

so i get v zero sine alpha times t 

plus onehalf but it is minus onehalf g t squared 

and now i get the velocity in the y direction at time t 

that is my second line 

that is going to be v zero sine alpha minus g t 

and the acceleration in the y direction at any moment in time 


equals minus g 

and now i have done all i can 

to completely decompose this complicated motion 

into two entirely independent onedimensional motions 

and the next lecture 

were going to use this again and again and again and again 

this lecture is not over yet but i want you to know 

that this is what were going to apply 

for many lectures to come 

the decomposition of a complicated trajectory 

into two simple ones 

now when you look at this 


there is something quite remarkable 

and the remarkable thing 

is that the velocity in the x direction 

throughout this whole trajectory 

if there is no air draft if there is no friction 

is not changing 

its only the velocity in the y direction that is changing 

it means if i throw up this golf ball 

i throw it up like this 

and it has a certain component in x direction 

a certain velocity 

if i move myself with exactly that same velocity 

with exactly the same horizontal velocity 

i could catch the ball here 

it would have to come back exactly in my hands 

that is because there is only an acceleration in the y direction 

but the motion in the y direction 

is completely independent of the x direction 

the x direction doesnt even know 

whats going on with the y direction 

in the x direction if i throw an object like this 

the x direction simply very boringly 

moves with a constant velocity 

there is no time dependence 

and the y direction on its own does its own thing 

it goes up comes to a halt and it stops 

and of course the actual motion is the sum 

the superposition of the two 

we have tried to find a way 

to demonstrate this quite bizarre behavior 

which is not so intuitive 


that the x direction really lives a life of its own 

and the way we want to do that is as follows 

we have here a golf ball 

a gun we can shoot up the golf ball 

and we do that in such a way 

that the golf ball if we do it correctly 

exactly comes back here 

thats not easy that takes hours and hours of adjustments 


the golf ball goes up and comes back here 

not here not here not there thats easy 

you can shoot it up a little at an angle 

and the golf ball will come back here 

once we have achieved that 

that the golf ball will come back there 

then im going to give this cart a push 

and the moment that it passes through this switch 

the golf ball will fire 

so that the golf ball will go straight up 

as seen from the cart 

but it has a horizontal velocity 

which is exactly the same horizontal velocity as the cart 

so the cart are like my hands 

as the golf ball goes like this 

the cart stays always exactly under the golf ball 

always exactly under the golf ball 

and if all works well 

the ball ends up exactly on the cart again 

let me first show you 

otherwise if that doesnt work of course its all over 

that if we shoot the ball straight up 

that it comes back here 

if it doesnt do that 

i dont even have to try this more complicated experiment 

so heres the golf ball 

im going to fire the gun now 



close close 

reasonably close 


well since its only reasonably close perhaps 

 class   

perhaps it would help if we give it a little bit of leeway 

there goes the gun 

here comes the ball 

and this is just in case 

tape it down 

so as im going to push this now give it a push 

the gun will be triggered 

when the middle of the car is here 

youve seen how high that ball goes 

so that ball will go  makes whooshing   

and depending upon how hard i push it
