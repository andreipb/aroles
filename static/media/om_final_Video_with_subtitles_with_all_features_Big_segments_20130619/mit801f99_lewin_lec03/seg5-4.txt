which is  degrees to y and my corkscrew will go up 

so i know the whole thing already 

i know that this cross product must be z roof 

the magnitude must be one 

thats immediately clear 

but i immediately have the direction 

by using the corkscrew rule 

now if youre very smart 

you may say aha you find plus z 

only because you have used this coordinate system 

if this axis had been x and this one had been y 

then the cross product of x and y would be 

in the minus z direction 

yeah youre right 

but if you ever do that i will killi you 

 class   

you will always always have to work 


with what we call a right handed coordinate system 

and a righthanded coordinate system by definition 

is one whereby the cross product 

of x with y is z and not y minus z 

so whenever you get in the future involved 

with cross products and torques and angular momentum 

always make yourself an xyz diagram 

for which x cross y is z 


never ever make it such that x cross y is minus z 

youre going to hang yourself 

for one thing that wouldnt work anymore 

so be very very careful 

you must work if you use the righthand corkscrew rule 

make sure you work with the righthanded coordinate system 

all right now the worst part is over 

and now i would like to write down for you 

we pick up some of the fruits now 

although it will penetrate slowly 

i want to write down for you equations for a moving particle 


a moving object in threedimensional space 

very complicated motion 

which i can hardly imagine what its like 

it is a point that is going to move around in space 

and it is this point p 

this point p is going to move around in space 

and i call this vector op i call that now vector r 

and i give it a subindex t 

which indicates its changing with time 

i call this location a of y i am going to call that y of t 

its changing with time 

i call this x of t its going to change with time 

and i call this point z of t 

which is going to change with time 

because point p is going to move 

and so im going to write down the vector r 

in its most general form that i can do that 

r which changes with time 

is now x of t which is the same as a over x there before 

times x roof plus y of t 

y roof plus z of t z roof 


i have decomposed my vector r into three independent vectors 

each one of those change with time 

what is the velocity of this particle 

well the velocity is the first derivative of the position 

so that it is dr dt 

so there we go first the derivative of this one 

which is dx dt x roof 

i am going to write for dx dt x dot because i am lazy 

and i am going to write for dx dt squared x double dots 

its often done but not in your book 

but it is a notation that i will often use 

because otherwise the equations look so clumsy 

plus y dot times y roof plus z dot times z roof 

so z dot is the dzdt 

what is the acceleration as a function of time 

well the acceleration as a function of time 

equals dvdt 

so thats the section derivative of x versus time 

and so that becomes x double dot times x roof 

plus y double dot times y roof plus z double dot times z roof 

and look what we have now accomplished 

it looks like minor but its going to be big later on 

we have a point p going in threedimensional space 

and here we have the entire behavior of the object 

as it moves its projection along the x axis 

this is the position this is its velocity 

and this is its acceleration 

and here you can see the entire behavior on the z axis 

this is the position on the z axis 

this is the velocity component in the z direction 


and this is the acceleration on the z axis 

and here you have the y 

in other words we have now the threedimensional motion 

we have cut into three onedimensional motions 

this is a onedimensional motion 

this is behavior only along the x axis 

and this is a behavior only along the y axis 

and this is a behavior only along the z axis 

and the three together make up 

the actual motion of that particle 

what have we gained now 

it looks like this looks like a mathematical zoo 

you would say well if this is what it is going to be like 

its going to be hell 

well not quite 

in fact its going to help you a great deal 

first of all if i throw up a tennis ball in class 


like this then the whole trajectory is 

the whole trajectory is in one plane 

in the vertical plane 

so even though it is in three dimensions 

we can always represent it by two axes by two dimensionally 

a y axis and an x axis 

so already the threedimensional problem 

often becomes a twodimensional problem 

we will with great success analyze these trajectories 

by decomposing this very complicated motion 

imagine what an incredibly complicated arc that is 

and yet we are going to decompose it 

into a motion in the x direction 

which lives a life of its own 

independent of the motion in the y direction 

which lives a life of itsi own 


and of course you always have to combine the two 

to know what the particle is doing 

we know the equations so well from our last lecture 

from onedimensional motion with constant acceleration 

the first line tells you 

what the x position is as a function of time 

the index t tells you that it is changing with time 

it is the position at t equals zero 

plus the velocity at t equals zero 

times t plus onehalf ax t squared 

if there is an acceleration in the x direction 

the velocity immediately comes 

from taking the derivative of this function 

and the acceleration comes 

from taking the derivative of this function 

now if we have a motion which is more complicated 

which reaches out to two or three dimensions 

we can decompose the motion in three perpendicular axes 

and you can replace every x here by a y 

which gives you the entire behavior in the y direction 

and if you want to know the behavior in the z direction 

you replace every x here by z 

and then you have decomposed the motion in three directions 

each of them are linear 

and thats what i want to do now 

im going to throw up an object golf ball or an apple in  


and we know that its in the vertical plane so we have 

we only deal with a twodimensional problem 

this being 

i call this my x axis and im going to call this my y axis 

i call this increasing value of x 

and i call this increasing value of y 

i could have called thisi increasing value of y 

today i have decided to call thisi increasing value of y 

i am free in that choice 

i throw up an object at a certain angle 

and i see a motion like this boing 

and it comes back to the ground 

my initial speed when i threw it was v zero 

and the angle here is alpha 

the x component of that initial velocity 

is v zero cosine alpha 

and the y component equals v zero sine alpha 

so thats the begins velocity of the x direction 


this is the begins velocity in the y direction 

a little later in time that object is here at point p 

and this is now the position vector 

which we have called r of t its this vector 

thats the vector that is moving through space 

at this moment in time x of t is here 

and at this moment in time y of t is here 

and now youre going to see for the first time 

the big gain by the way that we have divided the two axes 

which live an independent life 

first x 

i want to know everything about x that there has to be known 

i want to know where it is at any moment in time 

velocity and the acceleration only in x 

first i want to know that at t   

well at t   i look there 

x zero thats the i can choose that to be zero 

so i can say x zero is zero thats my free choice 

now i need v zero x what is the velocity 

the velocity at t   which we have called v zero x 

is this velocity v zero cosine alpha 

and its not going to change 

why is it not going to change 

because there is no a of x so this term here is zero 

we only have this one 

so at all moments in time 

the velocity in the x direction is v zero cosine alpha 

and the a of x equals zero 



now i want to do the same in the x direction for time t 

well at time t i look there at the first equation 

there it is x zero is zero 

i know v zero x that is v zero cosine alpha 

so x of t is v zero cosine alpha times t 

but there is no acceleration so thats it 

what is vx of t 

the velocity in the x direction at any moment in time 

that is that equation that is simply v zero x 

it is not changing in time 

because there is no acceleration 

so the initial velocity at t zero is the same
