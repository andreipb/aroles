to sort of keep him from having a little bit too much fun 

lets just say that franklin who was in his seventies at 

this point so hes advanced in age 

franklin liked the ladies and the ladies liked franklin 

and particularly given that he was the fad of the court 

i think franklin had a very enjoyable time in paris 

laughs and so washingtonone of 

washingtons aides actually gets sent to sort of babysit 

benjamin franklin 

now all of this adulation of franklin irked john adams 

surprise surprise 

laughter john adams really sort of on 

some fundamental level thought that he deserved some too 

and franklin was so beloved it really proved irksome to adams 

he kept a diary and in the diary he tended to record 

adulation moments of franklin heres another one of 

those darn moments where they just loved this guy 

and i want to offer one just so you can get a sense of what this 


would have been like i guess both for adams and 

franklin 

this is from adams diary from his journal 

from april  and this is what adams 

after dinner we went to the academy of sciences 

voltaire and franklin were both present 

and there presently arose a general cry that monsieur 

voltaire and monsieur franklin should be introduced to each 

other 

this was done and they bowed and spoke to each other 


this was no satisfaction 

there must be something more 

neither of our philosophers seemed to divine what was wished 

or expected 

they however took each other by the hand  

but this was not enough 

the clamor continued until the explanation came out 

il faut sembrasser  la franaise 

right 

they have to embrace themselves french style 

the two aged actors upon this great theater of philosophy 

and frivolity then embraced each other 


by hugging one another in their arms and kissing each others 

cheeks and then the tumult 

subsided 

so theres franklins sort of everyday existence in paris 

which was pretty extreme 

so franklin is there living it up in paris 

hes there when news of saratoga reaches france 

on hearing the news france decides ultimately that 

theyre going to formally recognize america as an 

independent nation obviously with franklin and 

adams and others helping things along 

and upon recognizing america as an independent nation 


the french went one step further and agreed to enter the 

war as allies to the americans 

so obviously saratoga happens 

the news gets to europe france hears it 

and those are two major 

france recognizes american independence 

france joins the war on the side of the americans 

with this agreement these really major two 

agreements for the first time there seemed 

to be a remote possibility that the americans might actually 

have a chance of being victorious 

this is a major major ally thats just signed 

up on the american side 

not only did the french bring credibility to the american 

cause but of course they also brought 

military supplies and most important of all 

as were going to see a little later in the lecture 

they brought the french navy 

america at this point is still figuring out how to have a navy 

so having the french navy was of huge importance 

now its important to note at this point that its not 

the dynamic here isnt that the french were so inspired by the 

nobility of the american cause that they decided they would 

join the war with the americans 

therethat is true for some french individuals 

ill talk a little bit more later on in the lecture about 

the marquis de lafayette 

hes one of a number of people who actually were inspired by 

the american cause 

but as a nation the french were particularly 

eager to help the americans because they assumed that after 

the war they might be able to take over much of the lucrative 

trade with america that the british had controlled before 

so basically joining america in this war 

effort was an investment now that they thought would probably 


pay off later and of course add to that the 

fact that by allying themselves with the americans theyre now 

fighting their longterm longtime enemy 

the british so that makes it an attractive 

proposition as well 

so in february of  france signed two treaties with 

america 

the first was the treaty of amity and commerce that said 

that france recognized the united states as a sovereign 

nation 

it also said that france had trading privileges with america 


as a favored nation but america preserved the right 

of free trade 

second france signed the treaty of alliance that would go 

into effect if war erupted between england and france 

because of the first treaty which indeed it did five months 

later so basically the first treaty 

of amity and commerce is signed britain and france now decide 

theyre warring and then france says okay 

now the treaty of alliance is going into effect 

we are now officially allied with america 

the stated purpose of the treaty of alliance was to assure 

the quote liberty 

sovereignty and independence absolute and 

unlimited of the said united states 

france renounced claims to the mainland of north america east 

of the mississippi or to the bermuda islands 


if captured by america 

in return france asked the united states to recognize 

whatever france might capture in the west indies 

in other words if france captures some british 

islands in the west indies america says 

fine 

laughs well recognize that for sure 

america was given a free hand to conquer canada 

laughs yay 

laughs conquer canada 

good thing we got that in the treaty 

and then both sides agreed not to negotiate for peace without 


consent of the other 

so now youve got britain and france in war against one 

another and with that the american 

revolution becomes something of a world war 

because spain and the dutch ultimately join on the side of 

the french 

so now europe and european powers and their own disputes 

also end up playing a role in whos siding with who during the 

revolution 

now its really important to note at this point that with the 

involvement of other european nations 

and particularly with the involvement of france 

america became far less of a central concern to the british 


who now felt compelled to send thousands of soldiers to the 

west indies to guard against french invasion 

which means that less manpower was available to fight in the 

united states 

the west indies or what at the time that would 

have been known as the sugar islands were the truly great 

prizes as far as colonies were concerned 

they were greater prizes than the north american colonies 

thats where the real money was in these sugar islands 

so some british manpower very naturally went right to the 

indies to protect british properties from the french 

at this point feeling a little desperate 

because of the frenchamerican alliance 

the british actually make one last stab at reconciliation 

they are persistentthough as well see in a few minutes 

they made some misjudgments that ultimately did not achieve
