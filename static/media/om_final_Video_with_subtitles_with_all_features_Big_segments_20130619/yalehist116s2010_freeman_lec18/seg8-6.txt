a major major impact on what happened at yorktown and thus on 

the war in general 

the french gave supplies 

they gave men 

they gave naval support 

they gave moral support 

they distracted the british 

in lots of ways the french had a huge influence 

on the outcome of the war 

now i noted earlier that french selfinterest 

played some role in the decision of the french to join on the 

side of the americans but it is also worth noting 

that there were some frenchmen who came to the aid of america 

because they actually really did get swept up into the american 

revolutionary cause and they saw it as a justified fight for 

freedom 

and the marquis de lafayette is maybe the most notable example 

of this 

he was really young at the time 

he was about nineteen years old 

hes a marquis so hes clearly very wealthy 

and obviously he was really moved by what was going on in 

america so he actually took a large ship 


loaded it with men and supplies and sailed to america 

just to volunteer his ship his men his supplies and 

himself 

here i am joining the american cause 

and he ended up being this really beloved figure in 

america 

washington really almost treated him like a son 

when you read letters that washington writes 

and washingtons not exactly a cozy kind of individual 

but clearly he had a lot of affection for lafayette 


but americans in general really admired and appreciated 

lafayette because he was sort of this starryeyed youth who 

sacrificed for the american cause for no reason 

he just appeared because he was swept into the cause 

and between  and  right on the cusp of the 

fiftieth anniversary of the declaration of independence 

lafayette actually came back to america for the sort of 

triumphal tour to sort of visit old friends 

i think he met with jefferson and adams and i think andrew 

jackson 

by  theres a weird conglomeration of people that 

hes meeting with 

but he went on a grand tour of all of america 

he went to all of the twentyfour statesand i think 

he was in his seventies at the time so hes pretty vigorous 

and he was celebrated 

he was paraded all over the place 

he had receptions where he sort of hung out ready to talk to 

americans 

americans of all kinds would line up on the street just to 

see him to watch parades go by to look at him enter their 

city 

so he was beloved at the time and then he was sort of 

in a way maybe he sort of symbolized french assistance 

the french alliance afterwards because americans 

gave a lot of love to the marquis de lafayette 

and its important to noteim mentioning lafayette because 

hes maybe the best known figure 

but hes not the only frenchman who volunteered to come and 

fight for the american cause and actually france is not the 

only country where people came voluntarily to join the american 

cause 

so back to the the aid of the 

clearly major major factor in the american 

victory 

and with the american victory at yorktown in  

the british decide to commence peace negotiations 

it is important to note that even though the british have now 

informally decided that theyre going to start negotiating for 

peace it doesnt mean that there was 

an instant ceasefire in the war 

there was kind of a fuzzy period here in which there was 


still a sizable british armed force in america 

the british hadnt officially declared surrender 

authorities in london told british forces that they should 

avoid battle unless attacked and they should begin to evacuate 

troops but yorktown was not really the 

instant end of the revolution and there are still skirmishes 

and battles afterwards for some time 

people dont have any way of really knowing the war is over 


theres still a british army there 

its not until june of  that negotiations began in 

paris 

americans sent a commission of four john adams 

benjamin franklin john jay and henry laurens 

its interesting to note that even now 

okay yorktown surrender war over 

were going to have a peace negotiation 

even now the british still hope that maybe thered be some 

way to come to terms with the americans that would still 

somehow leave america within the british empire 

theyre really persistent 

and it wasnt until john jay arrived in parisand he is a 

nononsense sort of straightforward person 

jay actually said look 

were not going to proceed with peace negotiations unless 

independence is assumed 

okay end 

laughs this is not negotiable 

were independent 

war over 

it wasnt until he really insisted that negotiations 

began and independence was really finally accepted as 

inevitable by the british 

so britain recognized american independence 

they agreed to evacuate all royal troops from american soil 

john adams thinking of new england got american fishing 

rights off of the grand banks of canada 

canada appears again 

i like the fact that john adams is there working for fishing 

rights 

okay yeah independence 

fishing rights 

laughter thank you john adams 

the americans promised that they would urge state 

legislatures to compensate loyalists for property loss 

during the war and agreed that british 

creditors would be able to collect prewar debts 

even though those two very nice things were agreed to by the 


americans in fact neither one happened in 

a very reliable manner and created all sorts of problems 

because there were a lot of states that were just not really 

excited about compensating loyalists or about repaying the 

british 

no mention was made of native americans 

many of whom had supported the british for really logical 

reasons given their fears about the 

spreading domination of an independent american republic 


with settlers swallowing up land 

and ultimately many indian nations simply didnt recognize 

american claims of sovereignty over their territory 

for the americans overall independence had been won 

but at a high price 

and actually only the civil war produced a 

higher ratio of casualties to the nations population 

and still undecided at the close of the war were two 

obvious big major questions 

what kind of society was america going to become 

and what kind of government would the new nation and its 

states possess 

these are two questions which were going to be talking about 

in lectures to come 

on thursday im going to talk about american society and then 

we sort of segue into a discussion of people wondering 

exactly whats supposed to be happening 

what kind of a national something is supposed to be 

governing over these states and thats going to lead us up
