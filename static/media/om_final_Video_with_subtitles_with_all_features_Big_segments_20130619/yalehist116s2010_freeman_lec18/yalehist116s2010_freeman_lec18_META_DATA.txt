Description
Today's lecture concludes Professor Freeman's discussion of the four phases 
of the Revolutionary War. America's victory at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 
marked the end of the third phase of the war, and led to a turning point in 
the conflict: France's decision to recognize American independence and enter 
into an alliance with the fledging nation. Although the British made one final 
attempt at reconciliation in 1778 with the Conciliatory Propositions, they were 
rejected by the Continental Congress. The fourth and final phase of the war 
lasted from 1779 to 1781, as the British Army focused its attention on the 
American South. The British seized Charleston and South Carolina, and defeated 
the Continental Army in a series of battles. But with the help of the French fleet, 
Washington was able to defeat Cornwallis's army at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. 
Peace negotiations to end the Revolutionary War began in Paris in June of 1782.
