the success of this attempt 

on february  lord north proposed in the 

house of commons the conciliatory propositions 

the conciliatory propositions february  

and the propositions called for the repeal of all of the acts 

that americans had found obnoxious 

right 

okay 

well take it all back 

no standing army in time of peace in the colonies 

no changes in colonial charters unless colonial assemblies 

request them england would agree to consider 


american representation in parliament 

or if americans preferred to recognize the american 

congress as a permanent institution 

right 

suddenly englands okay well take back all the 

things you hate if we just end this now 

based on those propositions the conciliatory propositions 

a british commission was sent to america with instructions to 

deal with the continental congress 

or by this point in a sense also could be called 

the confederation congress but ill talk more about the 

confederation later on to deal with the continental 

congress as if it was a legal body 

but congress refused to appoint commissioners to meet with the 

british commissioners 

instead they considered the propositions on their own in 

congress and then sent a letter with their response to the 

british commissioners 

as henry laurens whos the president of the 

congress at the time put it in this 

the acts of the british parliament 

the commission for your sovereign right 

your sovereign not our sovereignand 

your letter suppose the people of these 

states to be subjects of the crown of great britain 

and are founded on the idea of dependence 

which is utterly inadmissible 

and laurens then went on to add that if the british wanted 


the americans would be happy to talk about peace 

if the king would either admit american independence or 

withdraw all of its forces from america 

so if the british are ready to do that the americans say 

were willing to talk to you 

otherwise no were not willing to admit that 

were dependent on you in any way 

this is utterly inadmissible 

take them back 

so clearly its too late for what could have been some pretty 


radical propositions 

at this point we come to the misjudgments 

because the british commission made a fatal error when they 

realized that that angle wasnt going to work 

they tried to bribe some highranked american officials 

including george washington who they offered to make a duke 

if george washington would agree to their terms 

as one of the commissioners put it washington is 

certainly to be boughthonours will do it 

and im assuming that the commission somewhere or other is 

thinking back to washington and the french and indian war and 

hes an ambitious guy and he actually wants military honors 

so the british are we can buy him 

show him a couple honors hes an ambitious guy 

weve got him 

they also attempted to bribe franklin as well 

again showing some misjudgment on the part of the british 

towards either one of those men and also assuming clearly how 

wonderfully attractive british honors would be 

that they would easily seduce either one of these two men 

neither one of them was attracted to this 

british honors were not going to sway them from their cause 

so not surprisingly both sides of this british 

effort were a complete flop 

now were about to advance to the fourth and final phase of 


the war but i do want to mention 

something else that happened in the winter of  

before i move on to this fourth phase 

and that is the american armys encampment at valley forge 

there americans for a time had really serious problems getting 

supplies 

supplies are always a problem generally partly because the 

congresscontinental congressdoes not have a way of 

insisting on anything 

i mentioned back when we talked about organizing a war 

the continental congress was not very strong 


couldnt demand things from the states 

could just ask so suppliesorganizing 

supplies was a problem 

but at valley forge they became a serious problem 

even just basic supplies like food 

partly because of the weakness of the continental congress as 

well as a simple lack of organization 

and actually some graft as well 

so men were starving some of them half naked 

some froze to death hundreds of horses starved to 

death 

the army didnt dissolve or mutiny at this point 

which actually says something but the experience of valley 

forge suggested to some of the men at washingtons headquarters 

that there were problems with the weakness of the continental 

congress 

and im going to come back to this lesson in future lectures 

when we begin to talk about the articles of confederation and 

the leadup to the constitutional convention 


because the experience of the revolution taught some people 

or led some people to believe that they had learned 

some hard lessons about what wasnt present 

as whatduring the war as far as the government was 

concerned and led them to believe 

something stronger needed to be there 

so in some ways working at washingtons 

headquarters during the war was like a little 

nationalistcreating machine where people at the center 

who saw how things were so hard to organize because of the 

weakness of the continental congress 

many of those people ended up believing that there needed to 

be a stronger government after the war 


thatll come in future lectures 

okay 

this brings us to the fourth and final phase of the war 

the southern campaign 

the southern campaign lasted from  to  

and this phase is marked by a decision on the part of the 

british to transfer their attention to the south 

hoping that by possessing ports of the south closer to the west 

indies they can maybe maneuver their fighting better 

they can keep their eye on whats everwhatevers 

happening in the indies they can also fight the 

americans in the south as well 

here the british again made a faulty assumption 

because they assumed that the south would be an easy target 

because they assumed that there would be a large reservoir of 


loyalist support 

so they really assumed they would seize key southern ports 

thered be all these loyalists there to help them 

and then they would move their way back north 

taking one region after another as they worked their way north 

so the british sailed to the carolinas 

they took charleston south carolina 

which was the most important city south of philadelphia 

they then left behind british general charles cornwallis with 

kind of a moppingup crew in the south while the rest of the army 

began to move north to attack the rest of the continental 

army 

between  and  there was a series of battles 

between the americans and the british in the south 

americans suffered defeat after defeat 

they persisted but they were not winning these 

battles 

the british won georgia they already had charleston 

and then the british began to pursue the americans into 

virginia and thats where the americans 

began to rally 

now in part this is due once again to 

supply problems this time for the british army 

for cornwallis the british supply lines were 

stretched to their maximum 

and continued fighting was beginning to take a real toll on 

cornwallis forces who suffered worse losses than 

were expected particularly considering they 

hadnt really expected much in the way of losses at all 

also loyalists remained largely silent in the south 

partly because the british didnt really treat them very 

well 

the british didnt do anything to court loyalists in the south 

the british ruled captured areas in the south under martial 


law and made no allowances for loyalists 

they didnt grant any power to loyalists so basically they did 

nothing to solicit loyalist support and thus they didnt get 

much loyalist support 

so cornwallis is following the american army 

he limps into virginia with his supply problem 

and while the british army is in virginia they plunder george 

washingtons plantation mount vernon 

just for a little zing 

well as long as were here lets attack mount vernon
