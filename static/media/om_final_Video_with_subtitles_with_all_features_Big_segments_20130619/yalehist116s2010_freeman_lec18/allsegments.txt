okay so a quick review of what we  

on thursday in the first of these two lectures in which im 

going to be talking about the war 

and hopefully as you hopefully remember 

we began by talking about the british and the logic of their 

actions during the war 

and i talked for a little while about a number of their 

logistical like problems getting supplies 

and then dragging them all over the american countryside 

like the large expanse of land that the british confronted that 

was one big battlefield in a sense 

the ways in which some kind of traditional battle strategies 

war strategies didnt necessarily work so well 

in this campaign and along the same lines 

that there were different kinds of challenges that the british 

faced in fighting against a citizen army 

i talked about how britain couldnt turn its back on the 

rest of the world particularly france 

they had to keep an eye on what france was doing and franceas 

youre going to see in todays lectureis going to play a 

large role 

and then finally i talked about the simple fact that for the 


british to win they needed to stamp out a 

widespread rebellion over a large expanse of land 

while the americans didnt necessarily have to defeat the 

british to emerge victorious 

they just had to keep fighting long enough to exhaust british 

supplies and funding and energies 

and i also mentioned a few mistaken assumptions on the part 

of the british like the way that they 

consistently underestimated the americans 

and then along similar lines the ways in which they 

consistently overestimated the amount of loyalist support that 

they were expecting to find in the colonies 


and i spent time in thursdays class going into those kinds of 

details before talking about phases of war and strategies and 

things like that because they help us to understand the logic 

of british military strategies throughout the war 

i think its really easy to look back on any historical 

event but i think its particularly 

true for the american revolution that leads to the american 

founding its easy to look back and 


blame the loser for making dumb mistakes 

but there were really logical reasons for what the british did 

during this campaign 

and thats part of what im trying to bring out in last 

weeks lecture and in todays lecture 

that there were logical logistical reasons why they did 

what they did 

there were equally logical reasons as to why the war 

ultimately had the outcome that it did 

but all of those things that i talked about in the last lecture 


at the start show how the british were acting under pretty 

challenging circumstances and they were guiding their 

decisions and doing whatever they decided to do based on 

whatever information and insight and tradition they had at hand 

so their actions have a logic and i bring that up at the 

start of this lecture because its part of what ive been 

doing overall in this class over the course of the semester 

and that is throughout whatever ive been 

lecturing about ive tried to explain the logic 

and reasoning behind peoples choices and decisions 

to give you a view of unfolding events from the viewpoints of 

people who were there 

now of course its just inherently interesting to look 


at historical events from the viewpoint of people who were 

there so thats part of the reason 

why i do this because its interesting and 

its fun and i find it fascinating 

but more important i actually take this approach 

because i want to emphasize the idea that the revolution wasnt 

inevitable 

it wasnt an inevitable event 

it wasnt a good revolt against bad people 

it was actually a product of individual choices 

individual actions on all sides and thats ultimately 

what history is all about 

right 

its about people making choices and then taking action 

and particularly in the case of the american founding period 


i think its an important thing to remember 

because its easy to forget that the revolution and its 

aftermath werent inevitable or inherently right 

it has to do with our nations founding 

so its natural to sort of assume those things 

but neither one of those things helps us to really understand 

what was unfolding as the revolution unfolded 

so basically in all of my classes 

i always try to counter the sort of seeming inevitability of 


things in the founding period by really trying to recreate the 

logic of decisions at that time in that moment 

so thats part of why ive been focusing in that way throughout 

the semester 

but okay back to the decisions of the revolution and thursdays 

lecture 

the bulk of my lecture on thursday was spent discussing 

three of the four phases of the revolution 

and again hopefully you remember i defined these phases 

based on shifts in british strategy at various points 


so the british would shift their strategy 

the americans would respond and then that phase would 

continue until thered be a new shift and a new response 

just to review very briefly here the first phase lasted 

until roughly july of  and was largely guided on the part 

of the british by the assumption that just a little coercion and 

maybe a little sign of reconciliation would be all that 

the americans needed to sort of push them into backing away and 

would bring matters to a close 

that phase lasted through july  

and at that point the british stepped up their strategy by 


deciding to seize new york seemingly one of the major 

cities in the colonies and again by sort of 

traditional war standards you get a major city 

you turn the tide of war plus the british were hoping 

that if they could sort of separate new england from the 

rest of the colonies they might isolate the troublemakers up in 

new england and again maybe that would draw things to 

a close 

in part at that point the british were underestimating the 

intercolonial and interregional bonds that were beginning to be 

forged throughout the conflict thus far 

and they also were overestimating what it would 

mean along those same lines to isolate new england 

so that strategy obviously didnt end things 

which leads us to the third phase which began in  

and that phase largely consisted of the british trying 

to subdue the middle colonies well now states by  


again sort of the basic assumption being lets keep 

going for those major cities and if we get enough of those 

major cities theyre going to have to cave 

so now philadelphia and pennsylvania become major 

targets in this third phase 

and then i ended the lecture by talking about americas shocking 

victory at the battle of saratoga 

which ended up being a real turning point in the war 

and im going to go a little bit more into thatreasons why 


thats the casetoday 

but i do want to mentionat the very end 

after i finished my lecture on thursday 

a few people came up to me with questions about precisely how 

the americans won at saratoga because i just sort of 

generally talked about problems with supplies 

and then the americans won and a few people had 

well what actually really happened 

so ill offer just a little bit more detail here to give you a 

sense of how it is that the americans came to have this 

unexpected victory 

so remember at that point british general howe is headed 


off to philadelphia as part of the major sort of attempt of 

that third phase of the war so general john burgoyne is up 

north with his army and lo and behold part of the 

continental army under horatio gates 

general horatio gatesattacks burgoyne 

and gates part of the army is joined by another part of the 

continental army led by general benjamin lincoln 

also militiamen from nearby areas 

individually and in groups began heading to saratoga when 

they sort of got a sense that something major was happening 

there 

so by october  of  there were roughly  

american troops all told facing roughly  british troops 

under burgoyne 

so now burgoyne is in a little bit of trouble and howe couldnt 


help him because hes down in the south somewhere 

and for a little while burgoyne thought that there might be 

another group of british soldiers led by sir henry 

clinton coming to save the day 

clinton and his men did not come to the rescue 

so burgoyne is in trouble 

and to give you just a little sense of what im talking about 

here heres a quote from a british lieutenant who actually 

took part in the battle 

and he writes that on october  in his regiment 

quote our cannon were surrounded and taken 

the men and horses being all killed 

which gave them the americans additional spirits 

and they rushed on with loud shouts 

when we drove them back a little way with so great loss to 

ourselves that it evidently appeared a 


retreat was the only thing left for us 

okay 

so thats a british soldier taking part describing massive 

deaths 

the americans get cheered by whats happening and sort of 

surge and the british come to the realization that theyre 

going to have to retreat 

so americans ultimately wage a war on the actual fort at 

saratoga and ultimately breech the fort 

and burgoyne withdrew his army to the heights of saratoga 

he lost roughly  men which was about four times the 

number of americans that are killed in that battle 

and thats the moment where burgoyne meets with his chiefs 

of staff and decides that at this point what they need to do 

is actually surrender 

and i mentioned at the very end of thursdays lecture the 


surrender ceremony when both sides were sort of so shocked at 

what was unfolding that they everyone was sort of quiet and 

the americans sort of had their eyes down 

supposedly because they couldnt quite believe what was 

happening in front of them 

now im going to mention one last fact regarding saratoga 

that i just sort of stumbled across today actually 

but i thought it was really interesting because it relates 

back to my earlier point about the british overestimating the 


amount of loyalist support that they had in america 

after he lost the battle burgoyne ends up going back to 

england and he ends up getting examined by parliament to 

explain exactly what happened at saratoga 

that must have been really fun for burgoyne 

and here are just one or two sentences from his testimony 

before parliament 

he said would the tories have risen 

why did they not rise round albany and below it at the time 

they found mr gates army increasing 

mr 

gates not general gates army 

a critical insurrection from any one point of the 

compass within distance to create a diversion 

would probably have secured the success of the campaign 

so there is burgoyne talking to parliament and saying 

where were the just a little action 


some diversion on the part of american tories might have saved 

the day but where were they 

i didntthey werent there 

so hes puzzled and hes partly blaming that 

for what happened at saratoga 

so the victory at saratoga accomplished important things 

militarily 

of course psychologically it was a tremendous victory for the 

americans after a series of somewhat less inspiring battle 

moments but in many ways the most 

important impact of the battle of saratoga was on the world 


stage 

because when news of the battle reached europe in december of 

 it gave some credibility to the 

american cause particularly in france 

which the americans had already been eyeing as a potential 

source of support during the war 

and that makes sense given frances longstanding enmity to 

england 

it makes perfect sense that the americans 

hmm maybe the french are going to come aid us as were fighting 

against their longtime enemy 

now franklinbenjamin franklin was in paris at this point when 

the news begins to reach europe 

he is serving as an american ambassador 

and while hes in france he proved that among his many 

talents he had an amazing talent at 

selfpromotion because although he was an 

extremely cultured american he was incredibly shrewd at 

playing the american in paris 

basically he knew what the french sort of expected 

americans to be like and they thought americans were 

going to be these sort of simple 

pure virtuous natural backwoodsmen 

so theres franklin 

hes in the splendorthe grand splendor of the french court and 

he dressed really really simplyand many of you 

have probably seen this image 

he always wore this sort of fur cap i just went out and 

killed myself an animal and now im wearing this hat 

laughter im a backwoods philosopher 

it wasbasically the role he was playing was the 

sort of amazing rustic natural backwoods american 

philosopher 

he continually presented himself in that way 

which really stood out among all the splendor of the french 

court and the french absolutely adored it 

he became a sort of fad of the french court 

there were countless portraits and images made of him 


he was put on dishes 

he was put on medallions 

as franklin himself put it my face is now almost as 

well known as that of the moon 

right 

they just adored him in france 

apparently franklin also knew how to enjoy himself in france 

because a little later in the war one of washingtons aides 

was sent to france to control franklin laughs 


to sort of keep him from having a little bit too much fun 

lets just say that franklin who was in his seventies at 

this point so hes advanced in age 

franklin liked the ladies and the ladies liked franklin 

and particularly given that he was the fad of the court 

i think franklin had a very enjoyable time in paris 

laughs and so washingtonone of 

washingtons aides actually gets sent to sort of babysit 

benjamin franklin 

now all of this adulation of franklin irked john adams 

surprise surprise 

laughter john adams really sort of on 

some fundamental level thought that he deserved some too 

and franklin was so beloved it really proved irksome to adams 

he kept a diary and in the diary he tended to record 

adulation moments of franklin heres another one of 

those darn moments where they just loved this guy 

and i want to offer one just so you can get a sense of what this 


would have been like i guess both for adams and 

franklin 

this is from adams diary from his journal 

from april  and this is what adams 

after dinner we went to the academy of sciences 

voltaire and franklin were both present 

and there presently arose a general cry that monsieur 

voltaire and monsieur franklin should be introduced to each 

other 

this was done and they bowed and spoke to each other 


this was no satisfaction 

there must be something more 

neither of our philosophers seemed to divine what was wished 

or expected 

they however took each other by the hand  

but this was not enough 

the clamor continued until the explanation came out 

il faut sembrasser  la franaise 

right 

they have to embrace themselves french style 

the two aged actors upon this great theater of philosophy 

and frivolity then embraced each other 


by hugging one another in their arms and kissing each others 

cheeks and then the tumult 

subsided 

so theres franklins sort of everyday existence in paris 

which was pretty extreme 

so franklin is there living it up in paris 

hes there when news of saratoga reaches france 

on hearing the news france decides ultimately that 

theyre going to formally recognize america as an 

independent nation obviously with franklin and 

adams and others helping things along 

and upon recognizing america as an independent nation 


the french went one step further and agreed to enter the 

war as allies to the americans 

so obviously saratoga happens 

the news gets to europe france hears it 

and those are two major 

france recognizes american independence 

france joins the war on the side of the americans 

with this agreement these really major two 

agreements for the first time there seemed 

to be a remote possibility that the americans might actually 

have a chance of being victorious 

this is a major major ally thats just signed 

up on the american side 

not only did the french bring credibility to the american 

cause but of course they also brought 

military supplies and most important of all 

as were going to see a little later in the lecture 

they brought the french navy 

america at this point is still figuring out how to have a navy 

so having the french navy was of huge importance 

now its important to note at this point that its not 

the dynamic here isnt that the french were so inspired by the 

nobility of the american cause that they decided they would 

join the war with the americans 

therethat is true for some french individuals 

ill talk a little bit more later on in the lecture about 

the marquis de lafayette 

hes one of a number of people who actually were inspired by 

the american cause 

but as a nation the french were particularly 

eager to help the americans because they assumed that after 

the war they might be able to take over much of the lucrative 

trade with america that the british had controlled before 

so basically joining america in this war 

effort was an investment now that they thought would probably 


pay off later and of course add to that the 

fact that by allying themselves with the americans theyre now 

fighting their longterm longtime enemy 

the british so that makes it an attractive 

proposition as well 

so in february of  france signed two treaties with 

america 

the first was the treaty of amity and commerce that said 

that france recognized the united states as a sovereign 

nation 

it also said that france had trading privileges with america 


as a favored nation but america preserved the right 

of free trade 

second france signed the treaty of alliance that would go 

into effect if war erupted between england and france 

because of the first treaty which indeed it did five months 

later so basically the first treaty 

of amity and commerce is signed britain and france now decide 

theyre warring and then france says okay 

now the treaty of alliance is going into effect 

we are now officially allied with america 

the stated purpose of the treaty of alliance was to assure 

the quote liberty 

sovereignty and independence absolute and 

unlimited of the said united states 

france renounced claims to the mainland of north america east 

of the mississippi or to the bermuda islands 


if captured by america 

in return france asked the united states to recognize 

whatever france might capture in the west indies 

in other words if france captures some british 

islands in the west indies america says 

fine 

laughs well recognize that for sure 

america was given a free hand to conquer canada 

laughs yay 

laughs conquer canada 

good thing we got that in the treaty 

and then both sides agreed not to negotiate for peace without 


consent of the other 

so now youve got britain and france in war against one 

another and with that the american 

revolution becomes something of a world war 

because spain and the dutch ultimately join on the side of 

the french 

so now europe and european powers and their own disputes 

also end up playing a role in whos siding with who during the 

revolution 

now its really important to note at this point that with the 

involvement of other european nations 

and particularly with the involvement of france 

america became far less of a central concern to the british 


who now felt compelled to send thousands of soldiers to the 

west indies to guard against french invasion 

which means that less manpower was available to fight in the 

united states 

the west indies or what at the time that would 

have been known as the sugar islands were the truly great 

prizes as far as colonies were concerned 

they were greater prizes than the north american colonies 

thats where the real money was in these sugar islands 

so some british manpower very naturally went right to the 

indies to protect british properties from the french 

at this point feeling a little desperate 

because of the frenchamerican alliance 

the british actually make one last stab at reconciliation 

they are persistentthough as well see in a few minutes 

they made some misjudgments that ultimately did not achieve 


the success of this attempt 

on february  lord north proposed in the 

house of commons the conciliatory propositions 

the conciliatory propositions february  

and the propositions called for the repeal of all of the acts 

that americans had found obnoxious 

right 

okay 

well take it all back 

no standing army in time of peace in the colonies 

no changes in colonial charters unless colonial assemblies 

request them england would agree to consider 


american representation in parliament 

or if americans preferred to recognize the american 

congress as a permanent institution 

right 

suddenly englands okay well take back all the 

things you hate if we just end this now 

based on those propositions the conciliatory propositions 

a british commission was sent to america with instructions to 

deal with the continental congress 

or by this point in a sense also could be called 

the confederation congress but ill talk more about the 

confederation later on to deal with the continental 

congress as if it was a legal body 

but congress refused to appoint commissioners to meet with the 

british commissioners 

instead they considered the propositions on their own in 

congress and then sent a letter with their response to the 

british commissioners 

as henry laurens whos the president of the 

congress at the time put it in this 

the acts of the british parliament 

the commission for your sovereign right 

your sovereign not our sovereignand 

your letter suppose the people of these 

states to be subjects of the crown of great britain 

and are founded on the idea of dependence 

which is utterly inadmissible 

and laurens then went on to add that if the british wanted 


the americans would be happy to talk about peace 

if the king would either admit american independence or 

withdraw all of its forces from america 

so if the british are ready to do that the americans say 

were willing to talk to you 

otherwise no were not willing to admit that 

were dependent on you in any way 

this is utterly inadmissible 

take them back 

so clearly its too late for what could have been some pretty 


radical propositions 

at this point we come to the misjudgments 

because the british commission made a fatal error when they 

realized that that angle wasnt going to work 

they tried to bribe some highranked american officials 

including george washington who they offered to make a duke 

if george washington would agree to their terms 

as one of the commissioners put it washington is 

certainly to be boughthonours will do it 

and im assuming that the commission somewhere or other is 

thinking back to washington and the french and indian war and 

hes an ambitious guy and he actually wants military honors 

so the british are we can buy him 

show him a couple honors hes an ambitious guy 

weve got him 

they also attempted to bribe franklin as well 

again showing some misjudgment on the part of the british 

towards either one of those men and also assuming clearly how 

wonderfully attractive british honors would be 

that they would easily seduce either one of these two men 

neither one of them was attracted to this 

british honors were not going to sway them from their cause 

so not surprisingly both sides of this british 

effort were a complete flop 

now were about to advance to the fourth and final phase of 


the war but i do want to mention 

something else that happened in the winter of  

before i move on to this fourth phase 

and that is the american armys encampment at valley forge 

there americans for a time had really serious problems getting 

supplies 

supplies are always a problem generally partly because the 

congresscontinental congressdoes not have a way of 

insisting on anything 

i mentioned back when we talked about organizing a war 

the continental congress was not very strong 


couldnt demand things from the states 

could just ask so suppliesorganizing 

supplies was a problem 

but at valley forge they became a serious problem 

even just basic supplies like food 

partly because of the weakness of the continental congress as 

well as a simple lack of organization 

and actually some graft as well 

so men were starving some of them half naked 

some froze to death hundreds of horses starved to 

death 

the army didnt dissolve or mutiny at this point 

which actually says something but the experience of valley 

forge suggested to some of the men at washingtons headquarters 

that there were problems with the weakness of the continental 

congress 

and im going to come back to this lesson in future lectures 

when we begin to talk about the articles of confederation and 

the leadup to the constitutional convention 


because the experience of the revolution taught some people 

or led some people to believe that they had learned 

some hard lessons about what wasnt present 

as whatduring the war as far as the government was 

concerned and led them to believe 

something stronger needed to be there 

so in some ways working at washingtons 

headquarters during the war was like a little 

nationalistcreating machine where people at the center 

who saw how things were so hard to organize because of the 

weakness of the continental congress 

many of those people ended up believing that there needed to 

be a stronger government after the war 


thatll come in future lectures 

okay 

this brings us to the fourth and final phase of the war 

the southern campaign 

the southern campaign lasted from  to  

and this phase is marked by a decision on the part of the 

british to transfer their attention to the south 

hoping that by possessing ports of the south closer to the west 

indies they can maybe maneuver their fighting better 

they can keep their eye on whats everwhatevers 

happening in the indies they can also fight the 

americans in the south as well 

here the british again made a faulty assumption 

because they assumed that the south would be an easy target 

because they assumed that there would be a large reservoir of 


loyalist support 

so they really assumed they would seize key southern ports 

thered be all these loyalists there to help them 

and then they would move their way back north 

taking one region after another as they worked their way north 

so the british sailed to the carolinas 

they took charleston south carolina 

which was the most important city south of philadelphia 

they then left behind british general charles cornwallis with 

kind of a moppingup crew in the south while the rest of the army 

began to move north to attack the rest of the continental 

army 

between  and  there was a series of battles 

between the americans and the british in the south 

americans suffered defeat after defeat 

they persisted but they were not winning these 

battles 

the british won georgia they already had charleston 

and then the british began to pursue the americans into 

virginia and thats where the americans 

began to rally 

now in part this is due once again to 

supply problems this time for the british army 

for cornwallis the british supply lines were 

stretched to their maximum 

and continued fighting was beginning to take a real toll on 

cornwallis forces who suffered worse losses than 

were expected particularly considering they 

hadnt really expected much in the way of losses at all 

also loyalists remained largely silent in the south 

partly because the british didnt really treat them very 

well 

the british didnt do anything to court loyalists in the south 

the british ruled captured areas in the south under martial 


law and made no allowances for loyalists 

they didnt grant any power to loyalists so basically they did 

nothing to solicit loyalist support and thus they didnt get 

much loyalist support 

so cornwallis is following the american army 

he limps into virginia with his supply problem 

and while the british army is in virginia they plunder george 

washingtons plantation mount vernon 

just for a little zing 

well as long as were here lets attack mount vernon 


they took slaves as they left 

george washingtons plantation manager 

lund washington to protect the plantation 

to prevent further damage being done 

actually went on board a british vessel in a nearby 

harbor and served the british refreshments 

right 

so please dont attack mount vernon and maybe youll even 

give us back our slaves and im bringing food 

have some cookies 

i dont know what they brought but they brought refreshments 

this did not please george washington at all 


as he wrote to lund washington to go on board their 

vessels carry them refreshments 

commune with a parcel of plundering scoundrels 

and request a favour by asking the surrender of my negroes 

was exceedingly ill judged 

it would have been a less painful circumstance to me to 

have heard that in consequence of your 

noncompliance with their request 

they had burnt my house and the plantation in ruins 

not really good judgment on the part of lund washington 

can you imagine 

hes sort of on thereon the boat sort of hanging out with 

the british and hes clearly a relation of the guy leading the 

continental army 

its not good not good thinking on the part 


of lund washington 

but so cornwallis is in virginia 

he forms a new base of actionafter hes plundered 

mount vernon 

he forms a new base of action at yorktown virginia 

near the coast planning to fan out into 

pennsylvania and virginia 

but just then august  

a french fleet under french admiral de grasse arrived at the 

virginia coast with troops and as were about to see 

this ends up being a really crucial turning point for whats 

happening in virginia and then ultimately for the war as a 

whole 

washington had troops on land in virginia 

but in the end it was the arrival of the french fleet in 

the harbor that really decided the battle 

because basically it surrounded the british and they had no way 

to escape 

the troops surrounded them on land 

they probably would have tried to escape to their ships in the 

harbor but now the french fleet was there making that 


impossible 

if the french fleet had arrived at the wrong time or in the 

wrong place this plan would have collapsed 

and sort of miraculously they actually get to the right 

place at the right time for the plan to really go into effect 

so the arrival of the french really looks bad for the 

british and cornwallis is low on supplies 

hes also low on men at this point 

and now hes trapped at yorktown trapped between 

american forces and the french fleet 

which now put the british under siege 

so cornwallis has roughly  men and there actually were 

some loyalists fighting there so they didnt antagonize all 

the loyalists in the south 

there were some fighting alongside the british at 

yorktown 

cornwalliss roughly  men held off a siege of roughly 

 combined american and french troops for three weeks 

which is actually a pretty amazing accomplishment 

but ultimately cornwallis was forced to surrender on october 

 

cornwallis wrote a terse note to sir henry clinton 

who was then in command of the british forces in america 

he wrote i have the mortification 

to inform your excellency that i have been forced  


to surrender the troops under my command 

by capitulation on the th instant 

as prisoners of war to the combined forces of america and 

france period 

mortified is a good word 

he could not believe what had happened 

stunned by what happened in this battle and just the 

incredible drama of the moment there are actually many 

many many eyewitness accounts of what was unfolding at 

yorktown because people understood on 

all sides that something major was happening 

people described during the formal surrender on 


october  the slow passage of the british 

troops past the eyes of the american troops who were lined 

up in two columns that stretched for half a mile 

the british band played a tune titled the world turned 

upside down which they surely felt it was 

witnesses said that the british looked 

quote unsoldierly and i think what that means is 

according to another witness they were very much in 

liquor 

laughs so the british are 

mortifiednot just cornwallisbut theyre 

mortified and basically they were drunk 

they couldnt quite believe that this was happening 

someone said that their ranks were broken and their step 

was irregular 

cornwallis was so mortified that he claimed to be sick and 

refused to attend the surrender 

and he sent a deputy to surrender his sword to 

washington and washington 

who is so good at sort of upholding the dignity of the 

cause refused to accept the sword 

from a deputy and had it delivered to his deputy 

so that terms were equal 

washingtons always good at the sort of symbolic gesture 

and then the british as they were marching by the american 

troops they had to lay down their arms under the terms of 

the surrender 

and when the british were told to lay down their arms one 

witness noted that quote 

their mortification could not be concealed 

i am a witness that they performed this duty in a very 

unofficerlike manner and that many of the soldiers 

manifested a sullen temper throwing their arms on the pile 

with violence as if determined to render them 

useless 

we are not to be surprised that the pride of the british 


officers is humbled on this occasion 

as they have always entertained an exalted opinion of their own 

military prowess and affected to view the 

americans as a contemptible undisciplined rabble 

now here we come to some documents i want to mention 

just because i discovered them years ago at the library of 

congress and i found them so interesting 

at the time 

its just something i would never have thought of before 

which is the glory of doing research when youre a 

historian is you just never know what 

youre going to find 

and i was actuallyi was at the library of congress 

i was actually researching dueling right 


so what i really wanted to know was 

supposedly americans learned to duel by watching the french 

during the revolution and they think this is such a 

great idea they take it themselves 

it sounds dubious to me but i was researching this to 

see if i could find any record of this 

and i found these letters frombetween actually british 

commanders and french commanders during the surrender at 

yorktown 

and what was fascinating about them is 

the british and the french are writing to each other and what 

theyre both basically saying in their letters 

the british are saying okay 

would you please tell the americans to step out of the way 

because they dont know how to do a surrender 

they dont know what theyre doing and theyre in the way 

just please french commander 

tell the americans to step aside because theyre pesky and 

theyre amateurs 

and the french are basically writing back to the british and 

saying yeah 

we understand the americans are in the way 

arent they cute those little americans 

well have them step off to the side 

you and i we know how to really have a real surrender 

dont worry 

your needs will be tended to 

so basically i found these letters in which 

the french and the english were treating each other as absolute 

equals and neither one was treating the americans as equals 

on the same plane 

and it really gives you a sense of how the french and the 

english were these sort of longtime old world war veterans 

who even though they were 

enemiesreally sort of understood and appreciated each 

other and the americans are such 

little sort of pipsqueak newcomers 

theyre not even on the radar screen 

so i thought that was fascinating to find the french 

and the english 

its not what i thought i would find 


i was oh cool letters between the 

french and the british during yorktown 

hey wait a minute 

laughs the french are telling us to 

get out of the way 

so it was interesting 

it really gives you a sense of sort of american status 

relatively speaking 

back in england one witness was with lord north 

when he received word of the loss at yorktown and 


as this witness wrote north took the news as he 

would have taken a shot in the breast 

for he opened his arms exclaiming wildly 

as he paced up and down 

oh god 

it is all overwords which he repeated many times 

under emotions of the deepest consternation and 

distress 

so at this point england which is already overtaxed 

definitely sees no sign of victory on the horizon 

decides to commence peace negotiations 

now clearly you can see how french aid had 


a major major impact on what happened at yorktown and thus on 

the war in general 

the french gave supplies 

they gave men 

they gave naval support 

they gave moral support 

they distracted the british 

in lots of ways the french had a huge influence 

on the outcome of the war 

now i noted earlier that french selfinterest 

played some role in the decision of the french to join on the 

side of the americans but it is also worth noting 

that there were some frenchmen who came to the aid of america 

because they actually really did get swept up into the american 

revolutionary cause and they saw it as a justified fight for 

freedom 

and the marquis de lafayette is maybe the most notable example 

of this 

he was really young at the time 

he was about nineteen years old 

hes a marquis so hes clearly very wealthy 

and obviously he was really moved by what was going on in 

america so he actually took a large ship 


loaded it with men and supplies and sailed to america 

just to volunteer his ship his men his supplies and 

himself 

here i am joining the american cause 

and he ended up being this really beloved figure in 

america 

washington really almost treated him like a son 

when you read letters that washington writes 

and washingtons not exactly a cozy kind of individual 

but clearly he had a lot of affection for lafayette 


but americans in general really admired and appreciated 

lafayette because he was sort of this starryeyed youth who 

sacrificed for the american cause for no reason 

he just appeared because he was swept into the cause 

and between  and  right on the cusp of the 

fiftieth anniversary of the declaration of independence 

lafayette actually came back to america for the sort of 

triumphal tour to sort of visit old friends 

i think he met with jefferson and adams and i think andrew 

jackson 

by  theres a weird conglomeration of people that 

hes meeting with 

but he went on a grand tour of all of america 

he went to all of the twentyfour statesand i think 

he was in his seventies at the time so hes pretty vigorous 

and he was celebrated 

he was paraded all over the place 

he had receptions where he sort of hung out ready to talk to 

americans 

americans of all kinds would line up on the street just to 

see him to watch parades go by to look at him enter their 

city 

so he was beloved at the time and then he was sort of 

in a way maybe he sort of symbolized french assistance 

the french alliance afterwards because americans 

gave a lot of love to the marquis de lafayette 

and its important to noteim mentioning lafayette because 

hes maybe the best known figure 

but hes not the only frenchman who volunteered to come and 

fight for the american cause and actually france is not the 

only country where people came voluntarily to join the american 

cause 

so back to the the aid of the 

clearly major major factor in the american 

victory 

and with the american victory at yorktown in  

the british decide to commence peace negotiations 

it is important to note that even though the british have now 

informally decided that theyre going to start negotiating for 

peace it doesnt mean that there was 

an instant ceasefire in the war 

there was kind of a fuzzy period here in which there was 


still a sizable british armed force in america 

the british hadnt officially declared surrender 

authorities in london told british forces that they should 

avoid battle unless attacked and they should begin to evacuate 

troops but yorktown was not really the 

instant end of the revolution and there are still skirmishes 

and battles afterwards for some time 

people dont have any way of really knowing the war is over 


theres still a british army there 

its not until june of  that negotiations began in 

paris 

americans sent a commission of four john adams 

benjamin franklin john jay and henry laurens 

its interesting to note that even now 

okay yorktown surrender war over 

were going to have a peace negotiation 

even now the british still hope that maybe thered be some 

way to come to terms with the americans that would still 

somehow leave america within the british empire 

theyre really persistent 

and it wasnt until john jay arrived in parisand he is a 

nononsense sort of straightforward person 

jay actually said look 

were not going to proceed with peace negotiations unless 

independence is assumed 

okay end 

laughs this is not negotiable 

were independent 

war over 

it wasnt until he really insisted that negotiations 

began and independence was really finally accepted as 

inevitable by the british 

so britain recognized american independence 

they agreed to evacuate all royal troops from american soil 

john adams thinking of new england got american fishing 

rights off of the grand banks of canada 

canada appears again 

i like the fact that john adams is there working for fishing 

rights 

okay yeah independence 

fishing rights 

laughter thank you john adams 

the americans promised that they would urge state 

legislatures to compensate loyalists for property loss 

during the war and agreed that british 

creditors would be able to collect prewar debts 

even though those two very nice things were agreed to by the 


americans in fact neither one happened in 

a very reliable manner and created all sorts of problems 

because there were a lot of states that were just not really 

excited about compensating loyalists or about repaying the 

british 

no mention was made of native americans 

many of whom had supported the british for really logical 

reasons given their fears about the 

spreading domination of an independent american republic 


with settlers swallowing up land 

and ultimately many indian nations simply didnt recognize 

american claims of sovereignty over their territory 

for the americans overall independence had been won 

but at a high price 

and actually only the civil war produced a 

higher ratio of casualties to the nations population 

and still undecided at the close of the war were two 

obvious big major questions 

what kind of society was america going to become 

and what kind of government would the new nation and its 

states possess 

these are two questions which were going to be talking about 

in lectures to come 

on thursday im going to talk about american society and then 

we sort of segue into a discussion of people wondering 

exactly whats supposed to be happening 

what kind of a national something is supposed to be 

governing over these states and thats going to lead us up
