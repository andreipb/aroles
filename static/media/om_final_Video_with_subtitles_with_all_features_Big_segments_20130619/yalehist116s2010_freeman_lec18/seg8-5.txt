they took slaves as they left 

george washingtons plantation manager 

lund washington to protect the plantation 

to prevent further damage being done 

actually went on board a british vessel in a nearby 

harbor and served the british refreshments 

right 

so please dont attack mount vernon and maybe youll even 

give us back our slaves and im bringing food 

have some cookies 

i dont know what they brought but they brought refreshments 

this did not please george washington at all 


as he wrote to lund washington to go on board their 

vessels carry them refreshments 

commune with a parcel of plundering scoundrels 

and request a favour by asking the surrender of my negroes 

was exceedingly ill judged 

it would have been a less painful circumstance to me to 

have heard that in consequence of your 

noncompliance with their request 

they had burnt my house and the plantation in ruins 

not really good judgment on the part of lund washington 

can you imagine 

hes sort of on thereon the boat sort of hanging out with 

the british and hes clearly a relation of the guy leading the 

continental army 

its not good not good thinking on the part 


of lund washington 

but so cornwallis is in virginia 

he forms a new base of actionafter hes plundered 

mount vernon 

he forms a new base of action at yorktown virginia 

near the coast planning to fan out into 

pennsylvania and virginia 

but just then august  

a french fleet under french admiral de grasse arrived at the 

virginia coast with troops and as were about to see 

this ends up being a really crucial turning point for whats 

happening in virginia and then ultimately for the war as a 

whole 

washington had troops on land in virginia 

but in the end it was the arrival of the french fleet in 

the harbor that really decided the battle 

because basically it surrounded the british and they had no way 

to escape 

the troops surrounded them on land 

they probably would have tried to escape to their ships in the 

harbor but now the french fleet was there making that 


impossible 

if the french fleet had arrived at the wrong time or in the 

wrong place this plan would have collapsed 

and sort of miraculously they actually get to the right 

place at the right time for the plan to really go into effect 

so the arrival of the french really looks bad for the 

british and cornwallis is low on supplies 

hes also low on men at this point 

and now hes trapped at yorktown trapped between 

american forces and the french fleet 

which now put the british under siege 

so cornwallis has roughly  men and there actually were 

some loyalists fighting there so they didnt antagonize all 

the loyalists in the south 

there were some fighting alongside the british at 

yorktown 

cornwalliss roughly  men held off a siege of roughly 

 combined american and french troops for three weeks 

which is actually a pretty amazing accomplishment 

but ultimately cornwallis was forced to surrender on october 

 

cornwallis wrote a terse note to sir henry clinton 

who was then in command of the british forces in america 

he wrote i have the mortification 

to inform your excellency that i have been forced  


to surrender the troops under my command 

by capitulation on the th instant 

as prisoners of war to the combined forces of america and 

france period 

mortified is a good word 

he could not believe what had happened 

stunned by what happened in this battle and just the 

incredible drama of the moment there are actually many 

many many eyewitness accounts of what was unfolding at 

yorktown because people understood on 

all sides that something major was happening 

people described during the formal surrender on 


october  the slow passage of the british 

troops past the eyes of the american troops who were lined 

up in two columns that stretched for half a mile 

the british band played a tune titled the world turned 

upside down which they surely felt it was 

witnesses said that the british looked 

quote unsoldierly and i think what that means is 

according to another witness they were very much in 

liquor 

laughs so the british are 

mortifiednot just cornwallisbut theyre 

mortified and basically they were drunk 

they couldnt quite believe that this was happening 

someone said that their ranks were broken and their step 

was irregular 

cornwallis was so mortified that he claimed to be sick and 

refused to attend the surrender 

and he sent a deputy to surrender his sword to 

washington and washington 

who is so good at sort of upholding the dignity of the 

cause refused to accept the sword 

from a deputy and had it delivered to his deputy 

so that terms were equal 

washingtons always good at the sort of symbolic gesture 

and then the british as they were marching by the american 

troops they had to lay down their arms under the terms of 

the surrender 

and when the british were told to lay down their arms one 

witness noted that quote 

their mortification could not be concealed 

i am a witness that they performed this duty in a very 

unofficerlike manner and that many of the soldiers 

manifested a sullen temper throwing their arms on the pile 

with violence as if determined to render them 

useless 

we are not to be surprised that the pride of the british 


officers is humbled on this occasion 

as they have always entertained an exalted opinion of their own 

military prowess and affected to view the 

americans as a contemptible undisciplined rabble 

now here we come to some documents i want to mention 

just because i discovered them years ago at the library of 

congress and i found them so interesting 

at the time 

its just something i would never have thought of before 

which is the glory of doing research when youre a 

historian is you just never know what 

youre going to find 

and i was actuallyi was at the library of congress 

i was actually researching dueling right 


so what i really wanted to know was 

supposedly americans learned to duel by watching the french 

during the revolution and they think this is such a 

great idea they take it themselves 

it sounds dubious to me but i was researching this to 

see if i could find any record of this 

and i found these letters frombetween actually british 

commanders and french commanders during the surrender at 

yorktown 

and what was fascinating about them is 

the british and the french are writing to each other and what 

theyre both basically saying in their letters 

the british are saying okay 

would you please tell the americans to step out of the way 

because they dont know how to do a surrender 

they dont know what theyre doing and theyre in the way 

just please french commander 

tell the americans to step aside because theyre pesky and 

theyre amateurs 

and the french are basically writing back to the british and 

saying yeah 

we understand the americans are in the way 

arent they cute those little americans 

well have them step off to the side 

you and i we know how to really have a real surrender 

dont worry 

your needs will be tended to 

so basically i found these letters in which 

the french and the english were treating each other as absolute 

equals and neither one was treating the americans as equals 

on the same plane 

and it really gives you a sense of how the french and the 

english were these sort of longtime old world war veterans 

who even though they were 

enemiesreally sort of understood and appreciated each 

other and the americans are such 

little sort of pipsqueak newcomers 

theyre not even on the radar screen 

so i thought that was fascinating to find the french 

and the english 

its not what i thought i would find 


i was oh cool letters between the 

french and the british during yorktown 

hey wait a minute 

laughs the french are telling us to 

get out of the way 

so it was interesting 

it really gives you a sense of sort of american status 

relatively speaking 

back in england one witness was with lord north 

when he received word of the loss at yorktown and 


as this witness wrote north took the news as he 

would have taken a shot in the breast 

for he opened his arms exclaiming wildly 

as he paced up and down 

oh god 

it is all overwords which he repeated many times 

under emotions of the deepest consternation and 

distress 

so at this point england which is already overtaxed 

definitely sees no sign of victory on the horizon 

decides to commence peace negotiations 

now clearly you can see how french aid had
