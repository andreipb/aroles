okay so a quick review of what we  

on thursday in the first of these two lectures in which im 

going to be talking about the war 

and hopefully as you hopefully remember 

we began by talking about the british and the logic of their 

actions during the war 

and i talked for a little while about a number of their 

logistical like problems getting supplies 

and then dragging them all over the american countryside 

like the large expanse of land that the british confronted that 

was one big battlefield in a sense 

the ways in which some kind of traditional battle strategies 

war strategies didnt necessarily work so well 

in this campaign and along the same lines 

that there were different kinds of challenges that the british 

faced in fighting against a citizen army 

i talked about how britain couldnt turn its back on the 

rest of the world particularly france 

they had to keep an eye on what france was doing and franceas 

youre going to see in todays lectureis going to play a 

large role 

and then finally i talked about the simple fact that for the 


british to win they needed to stamp out a 

widespread rebellion over a large expanse of land 

while the americans didnt necessarily have to defeat the 

british to emerge victorious 

they just had to keep fighting long enough to exhaust british 

supplies and funding and energies 

and i also mentioned a few mistaken assumptions on the part 

of the british like the way that they 

consistently underestimated the americans 

and then along similar lines the ways in which they 

consistently overestimated the amount of loyalist support that 

they were expecting to find in the colonies 


and i spent time in thursdays class going into those kinds of 

details before talking about phases of war and strategies and 

things like that because they help us to understand the logic 

of british military strategies throughout the war 

i think its really easy to look back on any historical 

event but i think its particularly 

true for the american revolution that leads to the american 

founding its easy to look back and 


blame the loser for making dumb mistakes 

but there were really logical reasons for what the british did 

during this campaign 

and thats part of what im trying to bring out in last 

weeks lecture and in todays lecture 

that there were logical logistical reasons why they did 

what they did 

there were equally logical reasons as to why the war 

ultimately had the outcome that it did 

but all of those things that i talked about in the last lecture 


at the start show how the british were acting under pretty 

challenging circumstances and they were guiding their 

decisions and doing whatever they decided to do based on 

whatever information and insight and tradition they had at hand 

so their actions have a logic and i bring that up at the 

start of this lecture because its part of what ive been 

doing overall in this class over the course of the semester 

and that is throughout whatever ive been 

lecturing about ive tried to explain the logic 

and reasoning behind peoples choices and decisions 

to give you a view of unfolding events from the viewpoints of 

people who were there 

now of course its just inherently interesting to look 


at historical events from the viewpoint of people who were 

there so thats part of the reason 

why i do this because its interesting and 

its fun and i find it fascinating 

but more important i actually take this approach 

because i want to emphasize the idea that the revolution wasnt 

inevitable 

it wasnt an inevitable event 

it wasnt a good revolt against bad people 

it was actually a product of individual choices 

individual actions on all sides and thats ultimately 

what history is all about 

right 

its about people making choices and then taking action 

and particularly in the case of the american founding period 


i think its an important thing to remember 

because its easy to forget that the revolution and its 

aftermath werent inevitable or inherently right 

it has to do with our nations founding 

so its natural to sort of assume those things 

but neither one of those things helps us to really understand 

what was unfolding as the revolution unfolded 

so basically in all of my classes 

i always try to counter the sort of seeming inevitability of 


things in the founding period by really trying to recreate the 

logic of decisions at that time in that moment 

so thats part of why ive been focusing in that way throughout 

the semester 

but okay back to the decisions of the revolution and thursdays 

lecture 

the bulk of my lecture on thursday was spent discussing 

three of the four phases of the revolution 

and again hopefully you remember i defined these phases 

based on shifts in british strategy at various points 


so the british would shift their strategy 

the americans would respond and then that phase would 

continue until thered be a new shift and a new response 

just to review very briefly here the first phase lasted 

until roughly july of  and was largely guided on the part 

of the british by the assumption that just a little coercion and 

maybe a little sign of reconciliation would be all that 

the americans needed to sort of push them into backing away and 

would bring matters to a close 

that phase lasted through july  

and at that point the british stepped up their strategy by 


deciding to seize new york seemingly one of the major 

cities in the colonies and again by sort of 

traditional war standards you get a major city 

you turn the tide of war plus the british were hoping 

that if they could sort of separate new england from the 

rest of the colonies they might isolate the troublemakers up in 

new england and again maybe that would draw things to 

a close 

in part at that point the british were underestimating the 

intercolonial and interregional bonds that were beginning to be 

forged throughout the conflict thus far 

and they also were overestimating what it would 

mean along those same lines to isolate new england 

so that strategy obviously didnt end things 

which leads us to the third phase which began in  

and that phase largely consisted of the british trying 

to subdue the middle colonies well now states by
