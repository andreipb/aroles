again sort of the basic assumption being lets keep 

going for those major cities and if we get enough of those 

major cities theyre going to have to cave 

so now philadelphia and pennsylvania become major 

targets in this third phase 

and then i ended the lecture by talking about americas shocking 

victory at the battle of saratoga 

which ended up being a real turning point in the war 

and im going to go a little bit more into thatreasons why 


thats the casetoday 

but i do want to mentionat the very end 

after i finished my lecture on thursday 

a few people came up to me with questions about precisely how 

the americans won at saratoga because i just sort of 

generally talked about problems with supplies 

and then the americans won and a few people had 

well what actually really happened 

so ill offer just a little bit more detail here to give you a 

sense of how it is that the americans came to have this 

unexpected victory 

so remember at that point british general howe is headed 


off to philadelphia as part of the major sort of attempt of 

that third phase of the war so general john burgoyne is up 

north with his army and lo and behold part of the 

continental army under horatio gates 

general horatio gatesattacks burgoyne 

and gates part of the army is joined by another part of the 

continental army led by general benjamin lincoln 

also militiamen from nearby areas 

individually and in groups began heading to saratoga when 

they sort of got a sense that something major was happening 

there 

so by october  of  there were roughly  

american troops all told facing roughly  british troops 

under burgoyne 

so now burgoyne is in a little bit of trouble and howe couldnt 


help him because hes down in the south somewhere 

and for a little while burgoyne thought that there might be 

another group of british soldiers led by sir henry 

clinton coming to save the day 

clinton and his men did not come to the rescue 

so burgoyne is in trouble 

and to give you just a little sense of what im talking about 

here heres a quote from a british lieutenant who actually 

took part in the battle 

and he writes that on october  in his regiment 

quote our cannon were surrounded and taken 

the men and horses being all killed 

which gave them the americans additional spirits 

and they rushed on with loud shouts 

when we drove them back a little way with so great loss to 

ourselves that it evidently appeared a 


retreat was the only thing left for us 

okay 

so thats a british soldier taking part describing massive 

deaths 

the americans get cheered by whats happening and sort of 

surge and the british come to the realization that theyre 

going to have to retreat 

so americans ultimately wage a war on the actual fort at 

saratoga and ultimately breech the fort 

and burgoyne withdrew his army to the heights of saratoga 

he lost roughly  men which was about four times the 

number of americans that are killed in that battle 

and thats the moment where burgoyne meets with his chiefs 

of staff and decides that at this point what they need to do 

is actually surrender 

and i mentioned at the very end of thursdays lecture the 


surrender ceremony when both sides were sort of so shocked at 

what was unfolding that they everyone was sort of quiet and 

the americans sort of had their eyes down 

supposedly because they couldnt quite believe what was 

happening in front of them 

now im going to mention one last fact regarding saratoga 

that i just sort of stumbled across today actually 

but i thought it was really interesting because it relates 

back to my earlier point about the british overestimating the 


amount of loyalist support that they had in america 

after he lost the battle burgoyne ends up going back to 

england and he ends up getting examined by parliament to 

explain exactly what happened at saratoga 

that must have been really fun for burgoyne 

and here are just one or two sentences from his testimony 

before parliament 

he said would the tories have risen 

why did they not rise round albany and below it at the time 

they found mr gates army increasing 

mr 

gates not general gates army 

a critical insurrection from any one point of the 

compass within distance to create a diversion 

would probably have secured the success of the campaign 

so there is burgoyne talking to parliament and saying 

where were the just a little action 


some diversion on the part of american tories might have saved 

the day but where were they 

i didntthey werent there 

so hes puzzled and hes partly blaming that 

for what happened at saratoga 

so the victory at saratoga accomplished important things 

militarily 

of course psychologically it was a tremendous victory for the 

americans after a series of somewhat less inspiring battle 

moments but in many ways the most 

important impact of the battle of saratoga was on the world 


stage 

because when news of the battle reached europe in december of 

 it gave some credibility to the 

american cause particularly in france 

which the americans had already been eyeing as a potential 

source of support during the war 

and that makes sense given frances longstanding enmity to 

england 

it makes perfect sense that the americans 

hmm maybe the french are going to come aid us as were fighting 

against their longtime enemy 

now franklinbenjamin franklin was in paris at this point when 

the news begins to reach europe 

he is serving as an american ambassador 

and while hes in france he proved that among his many 

talents he had an amazing talent at 

selfpromotion because although he was an 

extremely cultured american he was incredibly shrewd at 

playing the american in paris 

basically he knew what the french sort of expected 

americans to be like and they thought americans were 

going to be these sort of simple 

pure virtuous natural backwoodsmen 

so theres franklin 

hes in the splendorthe grand splendor of the french court and 

he dressed really really simplyand many of you 

have probably seen this image 

he always wore this sort of fur cap i just went out and 

killed myself an animal and now im wearing this hat 

laughter im a backwoods philosopher 

it wasbasically the role he was playing was the 

sort of amazing rustic natural backwoods american 

philosopher 

he continually presented himself in that way 

which really stood out among all the splendor of the french 

court and the french absolutely adored it 

he became a sort of fad of the french court 

there were countless portraits and images made of him 


he was put on dishes 

he was put on medallions 

as franklin himself put it my face is now almost as 

well known as that of the moon 

right 

they just adored him in france 

apparently franklin also knew how to enjoy himself in france 

because a little later in the war one of washingtons aides 

was sent to france to control franklin laughs
