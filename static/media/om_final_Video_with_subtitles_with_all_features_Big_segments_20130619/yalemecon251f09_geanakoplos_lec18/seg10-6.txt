how do you make them in between 

well suppose that for example 

i only did one thing 

suppose its costly to prepay 

some people just say to themselves im going to 

have to take a whole day off of work 

im not going to write my paper 

i might lose some business that i was going to do that day 

a whole bunch of stuff im losing so im going to subtract 

that 

im not going to prepay 

im not going to even think about doing it unless i can get 


at least a certain benefit from having done it 

so you can add a cost of prepaying and people arent 

going to prepay unless the gain that they have by prepaying 

exceeds the cost of doing the prepayments 

so to take the simplest case lets suppose the very act of 

never mind the thinking and all that 

the very act of prepaying going to the bank literally 

costs you money 

so if you have a value if the thing is  and you can 

prepay you know if you do your 

calculations and dont prepay today its worth  and if you 

prepay today the remaining balance is  youre saving  

dollars but if the cost of prepayment 

is  youre still not going to do it 

so you get a guy with a high cost of prepaying 

an infinite cost of prepaying hes going to look like hes 

totally unalert 

a guy with zero cost of paying is going to look like hes 

totally alert 

so you can have gradations of rationality and you can have 

different dimensions 

so you can have cost of prepaying and you can have 


alertness 

whats the percentage of time youre actually paying attention 

that month 

what fraction of the months do you actually pay attention 

and you can have a distribution of people different costs and 

different alertnesses 

so thats the model that i built 

its a simplified form of it 

it gives you an idea 

so heres this burnout effect that i showed that if you take 

the same coupons but an older one rather than 

aan older one thats burned out will always prepay slower 

so the pink one is always less than the blue one because it 

went through an opportunity to prepay 

so here you start with a pool of guys on the right 

and then after a while after time has gone down a lot 

of them have prepaid 

so heres alertness and cost 

so you describe a person by what his cost of prepaying is 

and how alert he is 

the more alert he is and the lower the cost of prepaying the 

closer to rational he is 

the less alert he is the higher the cost of 

prepaying the closer to the totally dumb guy he is 

and so you could have a whole normally distributed 

distribution of people and over time those groups are going to 

be reduced because a lot of them are prepaying 

but they wont be reduce symmetrically 

the low cost high alertness guys are going to disappear much 

faster and the pools going to get more and more favorable to 

you 

and so anyway all you have to do is 

parameterize the cost what the distribution of people 

in the population what the standard deviation and 

expectation of cost is and of alertness is 

and that tells you what this distribution looks like 


so youre fitting four numbers and youve got thousands of 

pools and hundreds and hundreds of months 

and fitting four parameters you can end up fitting all the data 

so look at what happens here 

so heres the same data 

so i just tell you i know that in a population 

given what ive calculated in the s there 

i know what fraction of the people have this cost and that 

alertness what fraction of the people are 


so close to dumb that their costs are astronomical and their 

alertness is tiny what fraction of the people 

have almost no cost and a very high alertness 

so im only estimating four parameters because im assuming 

its normally distributed 

given that fixed pool of people i apply that to the beginning of 

every single mortgage and i just crank out what would those guys 

do 

in the tree if they knew what the volatilities were when would 

they decide to prepay and then i have to follow a 

scenario out in the future and i say 

well along this path which guy would prepay and which 

guy wouldnt prepay and what would the total prepayments look 

along that path 

and so this has generated the pink line from the model with no 

knowledge of the world except i fit those parameters and look 

how close it is to what actually happened 

so it turns out that it was incredibly easy to predict 

contingently predict what prepayments were going to be and 


therefore to be able to value mortgages 

and this was a secret that not many people 

you know a bunch of people understood 

but not that many understood and so for years we were 

trading at our hedge fund first at kidder and then at 

ellington with this ability to contingently forecast 

prepayments at a very high rate 

and why was it so stable the prediction 

and so reliable 

its because the class of people stayed pretty much the 

same and every year thered be the same kinds of people with 


the same kinds of behavior 

some were very alert 

some were very not alert but the distribution of types 

was more or less the same and you could predict with pretty 

good accuracy what was going to happen from year to year 

of course then after  or so the class of people started 

to radically change and many more people who never got 

mortgages before got them and it became much harder to predict 

what they were going to do 

but so in the old days it was pretty easy to predict 

and why was it so easy to predict 

because it was an agent based model agent based 

so by the way i added this volatility here 

so these guys who just ran regressions they had to have a 

volatility or something parameter 

so you see as volatility goes up the prepayments are slower 

well they just had to notice that and build it right into 

their function 

i didnt even have to think of that or burnout 

none of those things did i have to think about because if youre 

a guy optimizing here and volatility goes up 

so you reset the tree so that the interest rates can change 

faster 

the option is worth more so youre going to wait longer 


youre not going to just exercise it right away because 

youve got a chance that prices will really go up so you can 

wait a little longer afford to wait longer 

so prepayments will slow down 

so all im saying all of this is just to say that 

if you have the right so its agent based 

its contingent predictions those two things together 

enable you to make quite reliable predictions about the 

future if youre in a stable environment 

and so what seems like a bewildering amount of stuff 

turns out to be pretty easy to explain 

so now what happens 

so do you have any questions here or should iyes 

you said you assume that those two  


are normally distributed 

did you select among some sort of variance 

some sort of what  

variance  

i had to figure out what the mean and  

variance is 

theres mean and variance of cost and mean and variance of 

alertness to get that distribution 

right 

so how do i know what the populationso let me just put 

the picture up again 

so who are the hyper rational guys 


they are the people with the really high alertness up there 

and the really low cost so theyre the guys back there 

theyre the hyperor maybe it was the guys 

you know one of these corners with very high alertness and 

very low cost 

i forgot which way the scale works 

it might be going down 

so anyway the guys with very high alertness and very low 

costs are the hyper rational people 

at the other corner youve got the guys who have very low 

alertness and very high costs 

theyre the people who youre going to make a lot of money on 

if youre the bank 

so how do i know how many people are of each type 

well i dont 

i have to fit this distribution 

but you see i have so much data 

ive got this kind of curve 

this kind of curve ive got for every starting year for the 

whole history and theres so many different interest rates 

and so many different so im applying that same 

population at the beginning of every single curve and then 

seeing what happens to my prediction versus what really 

happened 

so ive got thousands and thousands 

and thousands of data points and only four parameters to fit 

so i pick the four parameters to fit the data as much as 

possible 

if i assumed everybody was perfectly alert instead of that 

curve that i showed you i put a huge crowd here of 

perfectly rational people then i would have found that i would
