so were talking now about mortgages and how  

value them and if you remember now a 

mortgage so the first mortgages 

by the way that we know of 

come from babylonian times 

its not like some american invented the mortgage or 

something 

this was  years old and we have on these cuneiform 

tablets these mortgages 

and so the idea of a mortgage is you make a promise 

you back your promise with collateral 

so if you dont keep the promise they can take your 

house and theres some way of getting 

out of the promise because everybody knows the collateral 

you might want to leave the home and then you have to have 

some way of dissolving the promise because the promise 

involves many payments over time 

so its making a promise backing it with collateral 

and finding a way to dissolve the promise at prearranged terms 

in case you want to end it by prepaying 

and that prepaying is called the refinancing option 


and because theres a refinancing option it makes the 

mortgage a much more complicated thing 

and a much more interesting thing and something that 

for example a hedge fund could imagine that 

it could make money trading 

so i just want to give you a slight indication of how that 

could happen 

so as we said if you have a typical mortgage 

say the mortgage rate is  percent 

maybe this is a different answer than i did 

so here we have an  percent mortgage with a  percent 

interest rate to begin with 

now if its an  percent mortgage the guys going to have 

to pay much more than  percent a year because a mortgage 

remember there are level payments 

were talking about fixed rate mortgages 

you pay the same amount every single year for  years 

now youre really paying monthly and ive ignored the 

monthly business because its just too many months and there 

are  of them 

so im thinking of it as an annual payment 

you have to pay of course more than  dollars 

a year because if the mortgage rate were  percent and you had 

a balloon payment on the end youd pay   

thats the way they used to work but they were changed 

so you could imagine the old fashioned mortgage would pay 

   if you didnt pay your  

somewhere along the line theyd confiscate your whole house and 

then take what was owed out of it and you could get out of it 

by paying  

the new mortgages instead of paying  every year for  years 


you pay  every year for  years because if you discount 

payments of  for  years at  percent you get  

so the present value is  at the agreed upon discounting rate 

or mortgage rate  percent 

and so you see how important this discount rate is 

and the remaining balance however goes down because 

every time youre paying youre paying more than the  percent 


interest 

youre paying in the first year  instead of  and so that gap 

of  is used to reduce the balance from  to  

and so you see the balance is going down over time and making 

the lender safer and safer because the same house is 

backing it 

so its called an amortizing mortgage 

now why is it difficult to value 

because you have the option any time you want 

and theres a good reason for that option 

any time you want you have the option of getting out of the 

mortgage and just saying okay ive paid  

payments of  i dont want to do it anymore 

i want to pay off  and then lets call it quits 

and they say okay 

and theres nothing they can do about it 

now when are you going to exercise that option 

youre going to exercise that option either because you have 

to move thats the intention of it 

or youll exercise it when its most advantageous to you 

now why could it become advantageous to exercise it 

well you dont really want to exercise the option and this is 


the way most people think of it backwards 

they think oh the interest rates are going 

down 

that means ill get a new mortgage with a lower interest 

rate 

theyre hoping for exactly the wrong thing 

if the interest rates go up what theyve got is a much 

better mortgage because theyre continuing to buy at the same  

percent interest and maybe interest rates in the economy 

have become  percent and theyre actually making money 

so people who borrow in times of high inflation do better 

when there are times of deflation the borrowers get 

crushed 

irving fisher said one of the main reasons for the depression 

being so bad is all the entrepreneurial people in the 

country as usual were borrowing 

and then there was a deflation and so they were getting 

crushed 

and the very people who drive the economy were being hurt the 

most 

and so that feedback he said was responsible for 

part of the severity of the depression 

so you see interest rates can go up or down and what happens 


when they go up if they go up high enough to  

percent you think my gosh 

ive made a fortune holding this mortgage 

im still borrowing at  percent and i can invest my 

money at  percent 

so youve made a fortune and the poor lenders gotten 

crushed 

on the other hand if the interest rates go way down here 

so the present value of what you owe if you kept paying it 


becomes huge you dont have to face that big 

loss because you just prepay at whatever the remaining balance 

is there and then youve protected your downside 

so by paying attention and deciding when the optimal time 

to prepay is you can save yourself a lot of 

money and thereby cost the bank a lot of money 

so when exactly should you prepay 

when should you exercise your options 

well in this example if you never exercised it youd be 


handing the bank effectively 

 dollars even though they lent you  

lent you  

so the bank would have made a  percent profit on you 

but if you exercise your option optimally youre going to make 

not  the bank is not going to get 

 dollars out of you theyre going to even get less 

than  dollars 

theyre going to get  dollars out of you 

so when exactly should you be exercising your option 


well we went over this last time 

ill do it once again 

so remember the payment you owed was 

 blah blah blah  

the remaining balance started of course at  and then it 

went down to  and then it kept going down from there 

so since i cant remember the numbers lets just call this 

b the remaining balance which 

happened to be you know it was  the 

first time 

lets call this b then i went to b 

b etcetera and then b is equal to  

no remaining balance after that 

so we said what should you doim going to do the 

calculation now a little bit differently 

i said after every payment of  you could always say to 

yourself do i want to continue or 

do i want to pay my option 

now you notice that if i had divided this by b 

say if you had a mortgage that was a little bit smaller 

barely over a  dollar for example 

that would divide everything by b 

the payments would all be divided by b and the 

remaining balances would all be divided by b 

so i could always scale this thing up or down 

theres nothing fancy about  nothing important about 

 

if the original loan was for  you just double all your 

payments and double all your remaining balances 


what could be more obvious than that 

so i want to think in those terms of a mortgage that always 

has  dollar left 

so suppose at any stage you had  dollar left in your mortgage 

your remaining balance was  

so lets say at any node lets ask the question 

what is the value of  dollar of remaining balance 

so if you start at  and you havent prepaid 

here youve got b dollars 

of course whatever the value of that is divided by 

b thats the value of  dollar 

so im just going to figure out the value of  dollar of 

remaining balance and im going to call that w 

lets say 

ill call that w of some node s 

so where am i 

im in some node in this interest rate tree 

right 

heres our interest rate tree and im anywhere just here 

and im doing backward induction so for all successor 

nodes i figured out what  dollar of remaining balance is 

and lets say its in period    so im in period  

b 

so what is the remaining balance at this node which i 

call s 

so its some node right there ofoh no ive lost it
