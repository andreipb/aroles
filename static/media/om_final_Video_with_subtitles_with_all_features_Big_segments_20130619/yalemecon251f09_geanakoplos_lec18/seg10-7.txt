have gotten prepayments at  percent up there and at  all 

the way over here and so it wouldnt have fit that curve 

so thats how i knew that there couldnt be that many perfectly 

rational people 

yes 

how can you know for sure that there  

only two patterns 

you mean how do i know cost and  

maybe theres some other factors 

yes well there probably are other factors 

so what would you commonsensically think are the 

factors 

what keeps people from prepaying 

i think the most obvious one is its a huge hassle and theyre 

not paying attention 

so those are the first two that i thought of 

could you think of another one 


maybe their age  

their age exactly  

so maybe demography has an effect on it 

so maybe for example you get more sophisticated the 

older you get 

so that was another factor we put in 

so im not telling you all the factors but these were the two 

main factors 

another factor was growing sophistication 

we called it the smart factor 

thats another factor 

so over time you get more sophisticated 


so anyway the point is with a few of these factors you got a 

pretty good fit and it was pretty reliable 

and you could predict what was going to happen contingently 

so now if you want to trade mortgages what are some of the 

interesting things that happen 

the first interesting thing to notice is that what do you think 

happens as the interest rate goes down 

so the first thing to notice isso ill just ask you two 

questions 

lets go on the other side 

im running out of room 

suppose that you have the mortgage value 

what you get in the tree 

so in this tree that weve built heres the tree 

its going like that and at every node were 

predicting for each class of people were 

predicting where his s are 

so that class is prepaying 

the other class is not as smart so theyre not prepaying here 

but maybe when things get really low theyll start 

prepaying here 

so each class of people each cost alertness type has 

its own tree 

theyre the same tree but its own behavior on the 


tree and then i add them all together 

so what happens with the starting interest rate 

so here we had  and this value was  or something 

right 

now suppose the interest rate went down to  

i drew this picture of interest and mortgage value 

what do you think happens 

so the interest startsthis is  percent is there 

as the interest rate goes down what do you think happens to the 

value of the mortgage 

if youre a bank and youve fixedthe mortgage rate is  

percent 

thats a fixed mortgage rate but now youve moved in the 

tree from here to here 

do you think your mortgage is going to go up in value or down 

in value 

its going up  

its going to go up because the interest  

are lower and the present value of the payments is getting 

higher 

so if the interest rate goes down the mortgage is going to go 


up like that typically 

but will it keep going up like this and this 

if it were a bond it would go up like that 

right 

a bond a  year bond which owed  over  r would keep going 

up and up the value before it got negative 

say 

it would go up 

as r got negative it would go way up like that 

so does the mortgage keep going up like that 

as the interest rate goes down is the value of the mortgage 

going to get higher and higher and higher 

suppose the guys optimal whats going to happen 

this is  here 

whatll happen 

yep 


hes going to  

hes going to eventually figure out that  

should prepay so itll go like this 

if hes perfectly optimal hell never let it go above  

so its going to go something like this 

as the interest rate gets higher you get crushed 

and as the interest rate gets lower you dont get the full 

upside because hes prepaying at  

hes never letting it go above  right 

so if hes not so optimal maybe your value will go up 

but not so astronomically high 

so this idea that the mortgage curve instead of being like 

this goes like that this is what was called 

negative convexity 

now the next thing to know is suppose that the guys are partly 

irrational so its going above  

so its starting to go like this 

then what do you think 

as the interest gets really low whats going to happen 

all right you just said it so 

if the guy was rational perfectly rational it would go 

like that 

hed never let it go above  but now suppose guys are not 

totally rational 

whats going to happen is theyre going to 

sort ofas rates get a little bit low theyre going to 

overlook the fact that they should prepay 

so now its advantageous to you 

things are worth more than  but if rates get incredibly low 

even the dumbest guy the highest cost guy is going 

to realize he has an advantage to prepay and so things are 


going to go back down like that 

so the values going to be quite complicated 

so this is the mortgage value as a function of interest rates 

just common sense will tell you this 

in a typical bond as the interest rate gets lower the 

present value gets higher 

you should expect a curve like that but because of the option 

if it were rationally exercised the curve would never get above 


 

it would have to go like that 

but now if people are irrational you can take 

advantage of them and get more than  out of them 

but if the situation gets so favorable to you it becomes 

blindingly obvious eventually to them 

that theyre getting screwed and eventually they act and 

bring it all the way back to  again 

so this value of the mortgage looks like that 

so thats a very tricky thing 

ill even write very tricky 


so if you dont know what youre doing you could easily 

get yourself hurt holding mortgages 

you could suddenly find yourself losing money holding 

mortgages 

so thats my next subject here 

i want to talk about hedging 

so we know something now about valuing mortgages 

now i want to talk about hedging and what hedge funds 

do and what everyone on wall street should be doing which is 

hedging 

so if you hold a mortgage youre going to hold it because 


maybe you can lend  to a bunch of people but actually get 

a value thats more than  

so it looks like youre here but if interest rates change a 

little bit suddenly this huge value you thought you had might 

collapse back down to  or the interest rates might go 

up and it might collapse to way below  

so you look like youre well off but there are scenarios 

where you could lose money and you want to protect yourself 

against that 

so how do you go about doing it
