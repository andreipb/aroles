how did we predict prepayments 

whats another way at looking at prepayments 

let me tell you something thats missing 

i used to ask people who wanted to work at kidder peabody or 

ellington the following little simple puzzle 

and most of the genius mathematicians always got this 

answer wrong 

of course we hired them anyway but theyd always get this 

wrong 

so the question is suppose youve got a group of 

people like this and you figure out what the value of the 

mortgage is and interest rates have been 

constant all this time 

lets suppose for one month interest rates shoot down 

interest rates collapse and half the pool 


 percent of the pool disappears 

so now youve only got  percent of the people left you 

had before and then interest rates return to exactly where 

they were to begin with 

should the pool thats left be worth  percent of the pool 

that you had just here or more than  percent 

or less than  percent 

so remember you had  people here 

youre the bank whos lent them the money 

youre valuing the mortgage payments theyre going to make 

to you youre getting a certain amount 

of money from them  percent of them suddenly 

disappeared in  month leaving  left 

but now interest rates are back exactly where they were before 

is the value of the mortgage starting here with the  

percent pool worth  percent of what it was originally 

more than  percent or less than  percent 

what do you think 

yes 

is it worth more than  percent  


those people dont understand interest rates and therefore 

theyre not  

option properly and  

their mortgages 

exactly  

so thats an incredibly important point 

its called the opposite of adverse selection 

every one of these events is selecting the people left not 

adversely not perversely 

whats the opposite of adversely 

favorably to you so the guys who are left are 

all losers but thats who you want to deal 

with 


you dont want to trade with the geniuses 

you want to trade with the guy whos not paying any attention 

so the guys left are the people who are never going to prepay or 

hardly ever going to prepay and so its much better 

now this function doesnt capture that at all 

right 

it doesnt say anything 

it just says your prepayments depending on where you are 

so whether you were here or here youre going to get the 

same prepayment but we know that thats not 


going to be the case 

in fact its clear that over here there must have been a much 

bigger incentive than there was over there 

so the prepayments are the same but actually interest 

rates here were vastly lower than interest rates there 

so this is not such a good function 

so how would you improve 

what would you do to take into account this adverse selection 


or actually proverse selection 

what is the opposite of adverse 

well it doesnt matter 

what would you think to do 

your whole livelihood depends on it millions 

trillions of dollars at stake here 

youve got to model prepayments correctly so how would you 

think of doing this 

just give me some sense of what a hedge fund does or what anyone 

in this market would have to do 

well most of them did this 

so what would you do 

yeah 

buy up old mortgages because the market  

probably under estimating their value 

well you would buy it up  

right after  

right here youd buy it up right  

but what model would you use to predict prepayments 

not this one so how would you imagine doing 

it 

you would imagine making a model just like your intuition 

so what does that mean doing 

someones asking you to run a research department 

make a model of forecasting prepayments 

all the data you have is aggregate data like that 

you cant observe individual homeowners in those days 

they wouldnt give you the information 

ill explain all that sunday night 

so this is the kind of data you have what the whole group of 


people is doing every year but what would you do to build 

the model 

adverse selection is very important or proverse 

selection 

its embarrassing i dont remember the word 

favorable selection a very important thing 

so how would you capture that in your model 

yep 

would you split it into two groups and  

model it separately 

so maybe another thing you could  

what if you instead of having this function that says what the 

aggregates going to do all the datas aggregate 

so all you can do is test against aggregate data 


but suppose you said the world 

all we can see is the aggregate but the people really 

acting are individuals acting not the aggregate 

its the sum of individual activities so what we should do 

now is have different kinds of people 

oh gosh sorry 

it was there already 

so lets go back to where we were before so realistic 

what you ought to do is you ought to say 

well  percentremember we had two kinds of people already 


weve already got two kinds of people sorry 

weve got these guys the guys who never call 

so theyre people 

thats a kind of person 

and suppose you go down here and you have the people who are 

optimally prepaying 

suppose you imagine that half the people were optimally 

prepaying and half the people never prepaid 

well would that explain this favorable selection 

absolutely it would explain it because when you went through 

your little tree and you went here 

and here and here and here by the time you got 

down here all those people all the optimal prepayers 

theyre all prepaying 

so you start off with halfoptimal guys and 

halfasleep guys 

once you get down here all the optimal guys have disappeared 

and the pool thats left is all asleep 

so of course the pool is worth much more here given the 

interest rate than it was over here 

in fact if it goes back then again to here where it was 

beforesorry thats same line 

if it goes back to herehave i done this right 

no ive got to go back twice here and then here 

so once it goes back to here if it goes here 

here here and here then the pool is going to be much more 

valuable here than it started there 

there are half as many people but its worth much more than 

half of what it was there 

so the way to do this is to breakso then youre looking at 

the individuals 

youre saying one class of people is very smart 

or one class of people is very alert its a much better word 


one class of people is very alert 

one class of people is very unalert and as you go through 

the tree the alert people are going to disappear faster than 

the nonalert people and thats why youre going to have a 

favorable selection of people whos left in the pool 

well of course there are no extremes of 

perfectly rational or perfectly asleep in the economy so what 

you can do is you can make people in between
