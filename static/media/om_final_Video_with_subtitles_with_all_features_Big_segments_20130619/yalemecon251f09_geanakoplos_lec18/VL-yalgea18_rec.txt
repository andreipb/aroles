VL-yalgea18 0.91 3.25 s0001 SO WE'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT 
VL-yalgea18 3.26 5.49 s0001 MORTGAGES AND HOW TO VALUE OF UM 
VL-yalgea18 5.49 8.10 s0001 AND IF YOU REMEMBER 
VL-yalgea18 8.10 12.14 s0001 A MORTGAGE SO THE FIRST MORTGAGES BY THE WAY 
VL-yalgea18 12.15 13.27 s0001 AH 
VL-yalgea18 13.27 21.29 s0001 AH THAT WE KNOW OF COME FROM BABYLONIAN TIMES IT'S NOT LIKING ALSO UM AMERICAN INVENTED THE MORTGAGE OR SOMETHING THIS WAS FOR 
VL-yalgea18 21.29 22.66 s0001 THREE THOUSAND 
VL-yalgea18 22.66 28.35 s0001 FIVE HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND WE HAVE A NICE CUNEIFORM TABLETS THESE 
VL-yalgea18 28.35 31.45 s0001 MORTGAGES AND SO THE IDEA OF A MORTGAGE IS 
VL-yalgea18 31.46 33.36 s0001 YOU MAKE A PROMISE 
VL-yalgea18 35.20 40.86 s0001 YOU BACK YOUR PROMISE WITH COLLATERAL SEE IF YOU DON'T KEEP THE PROMISE THEY CAN TAKE YOUR HOUSE 
VL-yalgea18 40.86 44.79 s0001 AND THERE ARE SOME WAY OF GETTING OUT OF THE PROMISED BECAUSE 
VL-yalgea18 44.80 53.14 s0001 EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOU MIGHT THE COLLATERAL YOU KNOW WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE THE HOME AND THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME WAY OF DISSOLVING THE PROMISE BECAUSE THE PROMISE INVOLVES MANY PAYMENTS OVER TIME 
VL-yalgea18 53.14 54.67 s0001 SO IT'S MAKING A PROMISE 
VL-yalgea18 54.68 61.16 s0001 BACKING IT WITH COLLATERAL AND FINDING A WAY TO DISSOLVE THE PROMISE CIVICS PREARRANGED TERMS IN CASE YOU WANT TO END IT 
VL-yalgea18 61.17 62.42 s0001 BY PRIX PAYING 
VL-yalgea18 62.42 66.28 s0001 MATT PRIX PAYING IS CALLED THE REFINANCING OPTION 
VL-yalgea18 66.28 69.06 s0001 AND BECAUSE THERE'S A REFINANCING OPTIONS 
VL-yalgea18 69.06 72.61 s0001 IT MAKES THE MORTGAGE A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THING 
VL-yalgea18 72.63 74.66 s0001 AND A MUCH MORE INTERESTING THING 
VL-yalgea18 74.66 80.30 s0001 AND SOMETHING THAT FOR EXAMPLE A HEDGE FUND COULD MAN COULD IMAGINE THAT THEY COULD MAKE MONEY TRADING 
VL-yalgea18 80.30 82.36 s0001 SO I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A SLIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 82.36 84.42 s0001 INDICATION OF HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN 
VL-yalgea18 84.43 86.05 s0001 SO AS WE SAID 
VL-yalgea18 86.06 94.84 s0001 IF YOU HAVE A TYPICAL MORTGAGE YOU KNOW SAY THE MORTGAGE RATE IS EIGHT PERCENT IS A DIFFERENT ANSWER THAN I DO BE OKAY SO HERE WE HAVE AN EIGHT PERCENT MORTGAGE 
VL-yalgea18 94.85 96.33 s0001 WITH A SIX PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 96.35 98.40 s0001 INTEREST RATE TO BEGIN WHEREAS 
VL-yalgea18 98.57 101.65 s0001 OKAY NOW IS THIS AN EIGHTY PERCENT MORTGAGE 
VL-yalgea18 101.65 110.33 s0001 THE GUYS HAVE TO PAY MUCH MORE THAN EIGHT PERCENT A YEAR BECAUSE A MORTGAGE REMEMBER THEIR LEVEL PAYMENTS FOR A FIXED RATE MORTGAGES YOU PAY THE SAME AMOUNT EVERY SINGLE YEAR 
VL-yalgea18 110.34 115.06 s0001 FOR THIRTY YEARS DO YOU REALLY PAYING MONTHLY I'VE IGNORE THE MONTHLY BUSINESS BECAUSE IT'S JUST 
VL-yalgea18 115.07 116.15 s0001 TOO MANY MONTHS 
VL-yalgea18 116.15 123.45 s0001 OF THOSE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY OF THEM SO I'M THINKING THAT IS A MANUAL PAIN YOU PAY A FORCE MORE THAN EIGHT DOLLARS A YEAR 
VL-yalgea18 123.46 124.86 s0001 BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING 
VL-yalgea18 124.87 131.99 s0001 ARE IF IF THE MORTGAGE RATE WORK EIGHT PERCENT ANY EDIBLE LOAN PAYMENT ONLY AND PAY EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 132.00 133.54 s0001 THAT'S THE WAY THEY USED TO WORK 
VL-yalgea18 133.54 135.09 s0001 BUT THEY WERE CHANGED 
VL-yalgea18 135.09 142.54 s0001 YES YOU COULD IMAGINE UH THE OLD FASHIONED MORTGAGE WOULD PAY EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT IF WE DIDN'T PAY YOUR EIGHT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE 
VL-yalgea18 142.55 144.47 s0001 THEY CONFISCATE YOUR WHOLE HOUSE 
VL-yalgea18 144.47 149.34 s0001 ARM AND THEN TAKE WHAT WAS OWED OUT OF IT AND YOU CAN GET OUT OF IT BY PAYING A HUNDRED 
VL-yalgea18 149.34 157.13 s0001 THE NEW MORTGAGES INSTEAD OF PAYING EIGHT EVERY YEAR FOR THIRTY YEARS YOU PAY EIGHT POINT EIGHT EVERY YEAR FOR THIRTY YEARS BECAUSE OF A DISCOUNT PAYMENTS OF EIGHT POINT EIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 157.13 159.66 s0001 FOREVER FOR THIRTY YEARS OF EIGHT PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 159.68 161.19 s0001 YOU GET A HUNDRED 
VL-yalgea18 161.19 162.79 s0001 SO THE PRESENT VALUE 
VL-yalgea18 162.81 167.83 s0001 IS A HUNDRED AT THE AGREED UPON DISCOUNTING WAITER MORTGAGE RATE EIGHT PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 167.83 169.18 s0001 AND SO WE 
VL-yalgea18 169.19 171.95 s0001 AND YOU SEE HOW IMPORTANT THIS DISCOUNT RATE IS 
VL-yalgea18 171.95 175.36 s0001 AND THE REMAINING BALANCE HOWEVER IS MORE 
VL-yalgea18 175.38 181.53 s0001 IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU'RE PAYING YOU'RE PAYING MORE THAN ONLY EIGHT PERCENT INTEREST YOU'RE PAYING 
VL-yalgea18 181.53 185.79 s0001 IN THE FIRST YEAR EIGHT POINT EIGHT INSTEAD OF EIGHT AND SO THAT GAP OF POINT EIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 185.79 191.34 s0001 POINT EIGHT EIGHT IS USED TO REDUCE THE BALANCE FROM A HUNDRED TO NINETY NINE POINT ONE ONE SEVEN 
VL-yalgea18 191.35 193.92 s0001 AND YOU SEE THE BOUNCES GOING DOWN OVER TIME 
VL-yalgea18 193.93 200.17 s0001 AND MAKING THE LENDER SAFER AND SAFER BECAUSE THE SAME HOUSE IS BACKING IT SO IT'S CALLED THE AMUR TIMES THING MORTGAGE 
VL-yalgea18 200.18 202.78 s0001 NOW WHY IS IT DIFFICULT TO VALUE 
VL-yalgea18 202.78 209.77 s0001 BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE OPTION ANYTIME YOU WANT AND IT'S THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR THAT OPTION ANYTIME YOU WANT YOU HAVE THE OPTION 
VL-yalgea18 209.77 217.95 s0001 OF GETTING OUT OF THE MORTGAGE AND JUST SAY OKAY I PAID THREE PAYMENTS OF EIGHT POINT EIGHT EIGHT I WANT TO DO ANYMORE I WANT TO PAY OFF NINETY SEVEN 
VL-yalgea18 217.95 219.60 s0001 POINT ONE THREE 
VL-yalgea18 219.61 221.17 s0001 AND LET'S CALL IT QUITS 
VL-yalgea18 221.18 225.98 s0001 AND THEY SAY OKAY THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW WHEN YOU GOING TO EXERCISE THAT OPTION 
VL-yalgea18 225.99 228.20 s0001 YOU'RE GOING TO EXERCISE THAT OPTION 
VL-yalgea18 228.21 231.34 s0001 EITHER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MOLD THAT'S THE INTENTION OF IT 
VL-yalgea18 231.35 235.01 s0001 OR YOU EXERCISE AT ONCE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS TO YOU 
VL-yalgea18 235.02 237.22 s0001 NOW WHY TO BECOME ADVANTAGEOUS 
VL-yalgea18 237.23 239.01 s0001 EXERCISE AS WELL 
VL-yalgea18 239.02 244.15 s0001 YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO EXERCISE THE OPTION THIS IS THE WAY MOST PEOPLE THINK OF IT BACKWARDS THEY THINK 
VL-yalgea18 244.16 246.28 s0001 ALL THE INTEREST RATES ARE GOING DOWN 
VL-yalgea18 246.29 249.13 s0001 THAT MEANS I'LL GET A NEW MORTGAGE WITH A LOWER INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea18 249.13 251.57 s0001 FISH THEY'RE HOPING FOR EXACTLY THE WRONG THING 
VL-yalgea18 251.58 253.35 s0001 IF INTEREST RATES GO UP 
VL-yalgea18 253.36 254.71 s0001 WHAT THEY'VE GOT 
VL-yalgea18 254.72 256.07 s0001 IS A MUCH BETTER 
VL-yalgea18 256.08 261.05 s0001 A MORTGAGE BECAUSE THEY'RE CONTINUING TO BUY AT THE SAME EIGHT PERCENT INTEREST AND MAYBE 
VL-yalgea18 261.06 265.58 s0001 A INTEREST RATES THE ECONOMY BECOME TWELVE PERCENT IN ACTUALLY MAKING MONEY 
VL-yalgea18 265.58 267.28 s0001 SO PEOPLE WHO ARE ALL 
VL-yalgea18 267.30 269.75 s0001 IN TIMES OF HIGH INFLATION DO BETTER 
VL-yalgea18 269.76 271.51 s0001 WHEN THOSE KINDS OF DEFLATION 
VL-yalgea18 271.52 276.87 s0001 THE BAR WAS GET CRUSHED IRVING FISHER SAID ONE OF THE RETE MAIN REASONS FOR THE DEPRESSION BEING SO BAD 
VL-yalgea18 276.88 281.15 s0001 IS ALL THE ENTREPRENEURIAL PEOPLE YOU COME IN THE COUNTRY AS USUAL WE'RE BORROWING 
VL-yalgea18 281.17 282.75 s0001 AND THEN THERE WAS A DEFLATION 
VL-yalgea18 282.76 286.17 s0001 AND SO THEY WERE GETTING CRUSHED IN THE VERY PEOPLE WHO DRIVE THE ECONOMY 
VL-yalgea18 286.18 290.48 s0001 WE'RE BEING HURT THE MOST AND SO HE THAT FEEDBACK HE SAID WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
VL-yalgea18 290.49 292.83 s0001 SEVERITY PART OF THE SEVERITY THE DEPRESSION 
VL-yalgea18 292.83 294.94 s0001 TO SEE INTEREST RATES CAN GO UP OR DOWN 
VL-yalgea18 294.95 296.52 s0001 AND WHAT HAPPENS 
VL-yalgea18 296.54 299.63 s0001 WHEN THEY GO UP THEY GO UP HIGH ENOUGH TO NINETEEN PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 299.64 305.51 s0001 YOU THINK MY GOSH I'VE MADE A FORTUNE HOLDING THIS MORTGAGE I'M STILL BORROWING AT SEVEN PERSON EIGHT PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 305.52 307.38 s0001 AND I'M I'M A A 
VL-yalgea18 307.39 313.74 s0001 YOU KNOW I CAN INVEST MY MONEY AT NINETEEN PERCENT YOU YOU MADE A FORTUNE A POOR LENDERS GOTTEN CRUSHED 
VL-yalgea18 313.75 314.81 s0001 ON THE OTHER HAND 
VL-yalgea18 314.82 321.48 s0001 IF THE INTEREST WEIGHTS GO WAY DOWN HERE SO THE PRESENT VALUE OF WHAT YOU ALL HE KEPT PAYING IT BECOMES HUGE 
VL-yalgea18 321.49 326.56 s0001 YOU DON'T HAVE TO FACE THAT THEY'VE LOST AS YOU JUST PREPAID AT WHATEVER THE REMAINING BALANCES THERE 
VL-yalgea18 326.57 330.24 s0001 AND THEN YOU'RE YOU PROTECTED YOUR DOWNSIDE 
VL-yalgea18 330.25 334.54 s0001 SO BY PAYING ATTENTION AND DECIDING WHEN THE OPTIMAL TIME TO PREPARE A IS 
VL-yalgea18 334.55 336.71 s0001 YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF MONEY 
VL-yalgea18 336.72 338.50 s0001 AND THEREBY COST THE BANK 
VL-yalgea18 338.51 339.72 s0001 A LOT OF MONEY 
VL-yalgea18 339.73 345.72 s0001 SO WHEN EXACTLY SHOULD YOU PREPAID WHEN SHE EXERCISE YOUR OPTION ONE THIS EXAMPLE HE NEVER EXERCISE THAT 
VL-yalgea18 345.73 347.76 s0001 YOU'D BE HANDING THE BANK EFFECTIVELY 
VL-yalgea18 347.77 349.28 s0001 A HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS 
VL-yalgea18 349.29 352.03 s0001 IN A WAY LIKE IN TWENTY SO THE BANK WOULD HAVE MADE 
VL-yalgea18 352.03 354.51 s0001 A TWENTY PERCENT PROFIT ON YOU 
VL-yalgea18 354.52 358.54 s0001 BUT IF YOU EXERCISE YOUR ARE YOUR OPTION OPTIMALLY 
VL-yalgea18 358.56 359.78 s0001 YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE 
VL-yalgea18 359.78 362.08 s0001 NOT A HUNDRED A 
VL-yalgea18 362.08 363.51 s0001 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE 
VL-yalgea18 363.52 369.78 s0001 THE BANK IS NOT GOING TO GET A HUNDRED DOLLARS A TO VIEW THE CAN EVEN GET LESS THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS THEY GOING TO GET NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS OUT OF YOU 
VL-yalgea18 369.79 378.14 s0001 OKAY SO WHEN EXACTLY SHOULD YOU BE EXERCISING YOUR OPTIONS WELL WHY WE WENT OVER THIS LAST TIME ALTHOUGH ONCE AGAIN 
VL-yalgea18 378.15 382.41 s0001 SO REMEMBER THE UH PAYMENT YOU ALWAYS BE POINT EIGHT EIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 382.42 384.29 s0001 EIGHT POINT EIGHT EIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 384.29 387.16 s0001 BLAH BLAH BLAH EIGHT POINT EIGHT FEET 
VL-yalgea18 387.17 393.12 s0001 THE REMAINING BALANCE STARTED OF COURSE AT A HUNDRED AND THEN I WENT DOWN TO NINETY NINE POINT ONE ONE 
VL-yalgea18 393.12 395.44 s0001 AND I KEPT GOING DOWN FROM THERE 
VL-yalgea18 399.34 401.42 s0001 BASE ALL SINCE I CAN'T 
VL-yalgea18 401.43 402.30 s0016 THE NUMBERS 
VL-yalgea18 402.31 404.25 s0016 AH LET'S JUST CALL THIS 
VL-yalgea18 404.25 407.43 s0001 WHILE THE REMAINING BALANCE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE 
VL-yalgea18 407.44 413.00 s0001 KNOWS NINETY NINE POINT ELEVEN THE FIRST GUY WAS COVERS BE WANT TO KNOW WHEN TO BE TOO 
VL-yalgea18 413.00 414.49 s0001 THESE THREE 
VL-yalgea18 414.50 417.20 s0001 SARAH AND THEN BE THIRTY 
VL-yalgea18 417.20 418.60 s0001 IS EQUAL TO ZERO 
VL-yalgea18 418.61 420.49 s0001 NO REMAINING BALANCE AFTER THAT 
VL-yalgea18 420.49 425.41 s0001 OKAY SO WE SAID WHAT SHOULD YOU DO UM TO DO THE CALCULATION NOW LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY 
VL-yalgea18 425.41 429.32 s0001 I SAID AFTER EVERY PAYMENT OF EIGHT POINT EIGHT EIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 429.32 431.28 s0001 YOU COULD ALWAYS SAVE YOURSELF 
VL-yalgea18 431.29 433.86 s0001 DO I WANNA CONTINUE OR DO I WANT TO PAY 
VL-yalgea18 433.87 435.42 s0001 MY OPTION 
VL-yalgea18 435.43 437.09 s0001 NOW YOU NOTICE THAT 
VL-yalgea18 437.10 440.27 s0001 IF I HAD DIVIDED THIS BY BE ONCE A 
VL-yalgea18 440.27 443.62 s0001 IF YOU HAD A MORTGAGE THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER 
VL-yalgea18 443.62 446.31 s0001 BARELY OVER A DOLLAR FOR EXAMPLE 
VL-yalgea18 446.31 447.87 s0001 UM 
VL-yalgea18 448.47 455.38 s0001 THE PAYMENTS WOULD THE PAYMENTS WITH ALL THAT WOULD DIVIDE EVERYTHING BY BE ONE THE PAYMENTS WOULD ALL BE DIVIDED BY BEING ON 
VL-yalgea18 455.39 458.88 s0001 OKAY AND THE REMAINING BALANCES WOULD ALL BE DIVIDED BY D. ONE 
VL-yalgea18 458.89 463.39 s0001 SO I CAN ALWAYS SCALE THIS THING UP OR DOWN THERE'S NOTHING FANCY ABOUT A HUNDRED 
VL-yalgea18 464.18 474.15 s0001 NOTHING IMPORTANT ABOUT A HUNDRED OF THE OF THE ORIGINAL COUPON ORIGINAL LOAN WAS FOR TWO HUNDRED YOU JUST DOUBLE ALL YOUR PAYMENTS AND A LAWYER MEANING BOUNCES WHAT THAT THE MORE OBVIOUS THAN THAT 
VL-yalgea18 474.15 476.16 s0001 SO I WANT TO THINK IN THOSE TERMS

VL-yalgea18 694.33 697.18 s0001 UH BUT I HAVE W. S. DOWN 
VL-yalgea18 698.71 700.82 s0001 AND IT'S ALSO TIME TO HAVE 
VL-yalgea18 700.82 704.62 s0001 OKAY SO HERE I PAY OFF MY RATE REMAINING DOLLAR 
VL-yalgea18 704.62 706.48 s0001 OR ARE THEY 
VL-yalgea18 706.49 707.56 s0001 OF 
VL-yalgea18 707.57 709.25 s0001 END UP WITH 
VL-yalgea18 709.26 715.26 s0001 THIS MANY DOLLARS YOU KNOW ASSUMING I HAD A ONE DOLLAR REMAINING BALANCE OKAY I'M EITHER GOING TO 
VL-yalgea18 715.26 722.12 s0001 UM PAYING OFF THE REMAINING BALANCE ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS MUCH LEFT NEXT PERIOD AND THE DOLLAR MEANING BOUNCES GOING TO BE THAT 
VL-yalgea18 723.65 725.85 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea18 725.97 733.93 s0001 THAT SET SO I KNOW NOW QUITE WORKING THIS FORWARDS I CAN ALWAYS TELL BACKWARDS I CAN TELL WHAT A DOLLAR AT THE BEGINNING IS WORTH 
VL-yalgea18 733.93 741.67 s0001 AND SO IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME CALCULATION I DID BEFORE EXCEPT I'M TALKING ABOUT A DOLLAR A MOSTLY GAMMA DOLLARS REMAINING BALANCE INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE THING 
VL-yalgea18 741.67 747.12 s0001 UM PRESENT FELLOW CALDWELL WAS OKAY SO HERE'S PRESENT VALUE OF THE DOLLAR PRINCIPAL 
VL-yalgea18 747.13 752.04 s0001 AND SO REMEMBER THE PRESENT VALUE OF A CALL THE MORTGAGES NINETY EIGHT POINT EIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 752.04 754.28 s0001 HERE THE PRESENT VALUE OF A DOLLAR 
VL-yalgea18 754.28 760.33 s0001 FIGURE OUT THAT WAY IS POINT NINE EIGHT OBVIOUSLY IT'S DIVIDED BY A HUNDRED BUT THE KEY IS THAT 
VL-yalgea18 760.34 765.21 s0001 NOW YOU CAN SEE JUST BY LOOKING AT IT WERE THE ONES ARE IS WHERE THE GUY DECIDED 
VL-yalgea18 765.21 766.36 s0001 TO PRINT K. 
VL-yalgea18 766.36 769.43 s0001 OKAY SO IT'S THE SAME THINGS BEFORE BUT YOU SEE BEFORE 
VL-yalgea18 769.44 772.22 s0001 YOU COULDN'T TELL VERY EASILY FROM THE NUMBERS 
VL-yalgea18 772.22 774.31 s0001 WHEN I DID A HUNDRED SORRY THEM 
VL-yalgea18 774.32 775.56 s0001 I'M GOING MAKE IT 
VL-yalgea18 775.56 783.73 s0001 BEFORE WANTING TO THE PRESENT VALUE WITH A HUNDRED ALL THESE NUMBERS WERE NINETY EIGHT SE NINETY SEVENS AND WHERE IS HE PREPAID IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER PREPAYMENT IS 
VL-yalgea18 783.75 786.61 s0001 IF I DO ALL IN TERMS OF THE DOLLAR REMAINING BALANCE 
VL-yalgea18 786.61 791.57 s0001 THEN JUST BY LOOKING AT THE SCREEN I CAN TELL WHERE THE GUY PREPAID OKAY BECAUSE THEY'RE ONES THERE 
VL-yalgea18 791.58 797.16 s0001 SO I KNOW WHERE IS PREPAID WERE THE ONES ARE THAT MEANS HE'S PREPAID SO I CAN TELL VERY EASILY WHAT HE DID 
VL-yalgea18 797.17 802.93 s0001 RIGHT THAT'S THE ONLY PURPOSE OF OF DOING THIS SOMEWHAT THE SAME CALCULATION SLUMBER TRICKIER WAY 
VL-yalgea18 802.94 806.17 s0001 SO YOU THINK ABOUT OF THE SECOND YOU SEE I JUST DIVIDED BY 
VL-yalgea18 806.18 808.95 s0001 I'VE ALWAYS REDUCE THINGS TO WHAT HE HAD A DOLLAR LEFT 
VL-yalgea18 808.95 813.72 s0001 ALRIGHT SO MISSED TELLS US WHAT TO DO WHEN THE GUY SHOULD REPAY MONEY SHOULDN'T PREPARE 
VL-yalgea18 813.73 815.84 s0001 SO IF YOU'RE NOW IN THE WORLD 
VL-yalgea18 816.20 818.28 s0001 LOOKING AT WHAT'S HAPPENING 
VL-yalgea18 818.28 822.65 s0001 YOU COULDN'T FIND THE HISTORICAL RECORD OF HOW PEOPLE ARE PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 822.66 823.95 s0001 SO LET'S JUST 
VL-yalgea18 823.95 826.86 s0001 LOOK AT THE HISTORICAL RECORD FOR EXAMPLE 
VL-yalgea18 826.87 829.04 s0001 UM HERE YOU CAN SEE 
VL-yalgea18 829.04 830.19 s0016 THIS IS A 
VL-yalgea18 830.20 832.22 s0016 AH 
VL-yalgea18 832.23 832.72 s0016 THIS IS 
VL-yalgea18 832.72 834.86 s0001 BLOWN UP WAS BUSY WHO'S 
VL-yalgea18 835.65 838.31 s0001 OKAY SO THIS IS WHAT 
VL-yalgea18 838.34 844.21 s0001 YOU MIGHT SEE AS THE HISTORICAL RECORD OF PERCENTAGE PREPAYMENT 
VL-yalgea18 844.29 846.03 s0001 A MOVE 
VL-yalgea18 846.19 847.87 s0001 ANNUALISED 
VL-yalgea18 847.87 851.02 s0001 FROM EIGHTY SIX TO NINETY NINE SAY 
VL-yalgea18 851.03 854.60 s0001 OKAY SO YOU NOTICE THAT THEY'RE VERY LOW HERE 
VL-yalgea18 854.65 860.38 s0001 AND THEN THEY GET TO BE VERY HIGH AND THEN THEY GET LOW AGAIN AND WE GET HIGH AGAIN SO WHY DO YOU THINK THAT HAPPENED 
VL-yalgea18 860.39 862.51 s0001 SO WHAT IS THIS IS PREPAYMENT 
VL-yalgea18 862.52 867.73 s0001 FOR A PARTICULAR MORTGAGE EIGHT PERCENT YOU TAKE ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY 
VL-yalgea18 867.74 871.18 s0001 WHO STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WITH EIGHT PERCENT MORTGAGES 
VL-yalgea18 871.19 878.23 s0001 THERE'S A HUGE CROWD OF THOSE BECAUSE THAT WAS ABOUT WHAT THE MORTGAGE RATE WAS THAT YEARS OLD HUGE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE GOT THESE MORTGAGES AN EIGHTY SIX 
VL-yalgea18 878.23 880.59 s0001 AND YOU CAN TRACK OF WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEM 
VL-yalgea18 880.60 881.71 s0001 PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 881.72 884.47 s0001 REALLY EVERY MONTHLY RATE THE ANNUALISED RATE 
VL-yalgea18 884.48 890.21 s0001 AND THEN THIS IS THE RECORD SO WHY DO YOU THINK CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY LIKE THAT WHAT'S THE EXPLANATION 
VL-yalgea18 890.21 891.72 s0001 WHAT 
VL-yalgea18 891.72 902.42 s0001 OKAY LOOKS LIKE THE STOCK MARKET PROVIDE I ASSURE YOU THE STOCK MARKET AND ALMOST NOTHING TO DO IT THAT WHY WOULD PREPAYMENT BE SOLO AND THEN BE SO HIGH THEM BELOW THE KNEE HIGHWAY THING WAS HAPPENING 
VL-yalgea18 902.42 908.82 s0001 INTEREST RATE WE JUST DID THAT WE JUST SOLVED THE WHOLE POINT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING SO YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK HAPPENED 
VL-yalgea18 908.83 910.47 s0001 IN NINETY THREE 
VL-yalgea18 910.84 915.65 s0001 THIS IS SEPTEMBER NINETY THREE ON YOU CAN READ THAT WHAT YOU THINK WAS GOING ON THAT 
VL-yalgea18 916.39 918.01 s0001 YEAH 
VL-yalgea18 918.01 920.55 s0001 INTEREST RATES GALLO EXACTLY 
VL-yalgea18 920.55 924.03 s0001 SO YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE BARELY BORN 
VL-yalgea18 924.04 925.11 s0001 IN A 
VL-yalgea18 925.11 930.20 s0001 IN THE EARLY NINETIES THERE IS A RECESSION AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT CUT THE INTEREST RATES 
VL-yalgea18 930.21 939.34 s0001 IN THE NINETIES THE EARLY NINETIES THERE'S A RECESSION IN THE IN AND THE GOVERNMENT KEPT CUTTING INTEREST RATES FURTHER AND FURTHER AND FURTHER WAS A HUGE DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES IN THE EARLY NINETIES 
VL-yalgea18 939.34 940.40 s0001 AND SO 
VL-yalgea18 940.41 942.29 s0001 WHAT HAPPENED ALL THESE PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea18 942.30 951.05 s0001 WHO WHO IN EIGHTY SIX TO HAVE THESE EIGHT PERCENT MORTGAGES THE NEW YORK INTEREST RATES WERE LOWER AND SO THEY ALL PREPAID YOU THAT THE SHOCKING AMOUNT OF PREPAYMENT 
VL-yalgea18 951.06 953.70 s0001 OKAY SO THIS GRAPH WHICH SEEMS SORT OF 
VL-yalgea18 953.70 956.86 s0001 YOU KNOW SURPRISING AND LOOKS LIKE THE STOCK MARKET 
VL-yalgea18 956.87 959.96 s0001 TURNS OUT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STOCK MARKET 
VL-yalgea18 961.29 966.40 s0001 IT HAS TO DO WITH WHERE THE INTEREST RATES ARE WELL WE THINK INTEREST RATES EXPLAIN EVERYTHING 
VL-yalgea18 966.41 967.99 s0001 UM 
VL-yalgea18 968.17 971.70 s0001 NO ONE ELSE COULD YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE 
VL-yalgea18 971.72 973.85 s0001 UM SKATE 
VL-yalgea18 974.63 981.60 s0001 OKAY WHAT ELSE COULD YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK THAT THE ONE ALSO WE LEARNED HERE BY DOING THESE CALCULATIONS 
VL-yalgea18 982.13 984.27 s0001 OKAY WELL WHAT WE'VE LEARNED 
VL-yalgea18 984.28 986.36 s0001 SO FAR IS THAT 
VL-yalgea18 986.36 989.04 s0001 IF THE PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO IT 
VL-yalgea18 989.05 991.96 s0001 IF THE INTEREST RATES IN THE ECONOMY OR SIX PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 991.98 997.27 s0001 THAT'S WHERE THEY STARTED REMEMBER WE SAID THEY STARTED SIX PERCENT OR SIXTEEN PERCENT VOLATILITY 
VL-yalgea18 997.27 1003.67 s0001 WHICH IS HERE I TWENTY PERCENT VOLATILITY OKAY DOESN'T MATTER I MEAN IT'S A PLAUSIBLE MODEL VOLATILITY LITTLE HIDE BUT 
VL-yalgea18 1003.68 1005.69 s0001 OKAY THAT VOLATILITY 
VL-yalgea18 1005.69 1007.16 s0001 THE UM 
VL-yalgea18 1007.91 1010.46 s0001 MORTGAGE RATE OF EIGHT PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1010.56 1012.20 s0001 IS NOT GOING TO GIVE 
VL-yalgea18 1012.22 1015.26 s0001 A VALUE OF A HUNDRED IT'S GOING TO CHEAT THE BANK 
VL-yalgea18 1015.27 1018.64 s0001 IF THE HOMEOWNERS ARE ACTING RATIONALLY THE BANK 
VL-yalgea18 1018.65 1024.58 s0001 YOU KNOW THEY COULD GET A HUNDRED TWENTY IN THE PEOPLE WERE ACTING RATIONALLY THERE HAS NEVER CAUGHT NEVER EXERCISED THEIR OPTION 
VL-yalgea18 1024.59 1026.51 s0001 THE EXERCISING OPTION APPLY 
VL-yalgea18 1026.52 1028.27 s0001 THE THING WAS ONLY WORTH EIGHT PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1028.28 1032.38 s0001 NOW I TOLD YOU AT THAT TIME THE INTEREST RATE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AROUND SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1032.40 1039.39 s0001 NINETY PERCENT GIVEN THESE SIX PERCENT INTEREST RATE THE ECONOMY THE MORTGAGE RATE SHOULD BE SEVEN HALF PERCENT SO WE DEDUCE LAST TIME 
VL-yalgea18 1039.40 1041.98 s0001 THAT OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERYBODY'S ACTING OPTIMALLY 
VL-yalgea18 1041.99 1044.31 s0001 YOU CAN TELL THAT LOOKING AT THIS AH 
VL-yalgea18 1044.32 1048.78 s0001 DIAGRAM HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT NOT EVERYBODY'S ACTING OUT OPTIMALLY 
VL-yalgea18 1048.78 1057.37 s0001 REMEMBER THESE ARE EIGHTY SIX MORTGAGES SO IT'S EVERYBODY'S TAKING THEM OUT OF THE SAME TIME WITHIN A FEW MONTHS WHICH OVER THE SAME EIGHT PERCENT MORTGAGE 
VL-yalgea18 1057.39 1059.08 s0001 HOW CAN YOU TELL FROM THIS GRAPH 
VL-yalgea18 1059.08 1061.63 s0001 BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTS EXERCISING THEIR 
VL-yalgea18 1061.83 1064.19 s0001 THEY'RE OPTION OPTIMALLY 
VL-yalgea18 1065.78 1070.05 s0001 COMPLETELY OBVIOUS WHY JUST LOOKING OUT FOR ONE SECOND YOU CAN SAY OFF 
VL-yalgea18 1070.06 1073.59 s0001 THESE PEOPLE CAN'T THE EXERCISING THEIR OPTION OPTIMALLY WHY IS THAT 
VL-yalgea18 1074.18 1075.64 s0001 YES 
VL-yalgea18 1075.65 1078.18 s0001 AND YET IT OUT 
VL-yalgea18 1079.89 1081.99 s0001 OKAY SO I SEE SAYS 
VL-yalgea18 1081.99 1091.94 s0001 WE'VE JUST DONE THE CALCULATION WITH THOSE ONES AND ZEROS I TOLD YOU WON THE RIGHT TIME TO EXERCISE THE OPTION AND SO EVERYBODY'S GOT THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCE EVERY SINGLE PERSON 
VL-yalgea18 1091.94 1098.18 s0001 IF ALL THE TRYING TO DO IS MINIMISE THE PRESENT VALUE THEIR PAYMENTS THEY SHOULD ALL BE PREPPING AT THE SAME TIME 
VL-yalgea18 1098.18 1103.15 s0001 HERE YOU SEE THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE PREPARING BUT YOU KNOW IT'S GETTING UP TO ALMOST TEN PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1103.16 1106.43 s0001 SO THESE PEOPLE ARE SO PROBABLY THIS IS A STUPID TIME 
VL-yalgea18 1106.44 1111.05 s0001 TO PREPAID BUT THE POINT IS THERE'S STILL TEN PERCENT OF THEM ARE PREPARING 
VL-yalgea18 1111.06 1115.12 s0001 AND OVER HERE OR ONE BECAUSE ONLY YOU OUGHT TO PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 1115.14 1118.96 s0001 IN THE ENTIRE YEAR LIKE THEY HAVE TWELVE CHANCES DURING THE YEAR 
VL-yalgea18 1118.97 1125.12 s0001 IT TAKES AN ENTIRE YEAR AND ONLY SIXTY PERCENT OF THEM HAVE HAVE FIGURED OUT THAT THEY SHOULD CREATE A 
VL-yalgea18 1125.11 1128.43 s0001 OKAY SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN A P. ACTING OPTIMALLY 
VL-yalgea18 1128.45 1131.47 s0001 SO THAT JUST FROM MY GRAPH THAT WOULD TELL YOU AND YOU HAVE 
VL-yalgea18 1131.48 1133.11 s0001 FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THAT 
VL-yalgea18 1133.10 1135.89 s0001 THE BEST EVIDENCE THAT THEY AREN'T ACTING UP TO WAIT 
VL-yalgea18 1135.91 1138.17 s0001 FURTHERMORE YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THE BANKS 
VL-yalgea18 1138.18 1140.89 s0001 DON'T EXPECT THEM TO THE ACT ACTING OPTIMALLY 
VL-yalgea18 1140.90 1145.93 s0001 BECAUSE THE BANKS ARE CHARGING THEM EIGHT OR NINE PERCENT INTEREST WHICH IS WHAT THEY WOULD NEED TO PAY 
VL-yalgea18 1145.93 1147.84 s0001 TO GET THE THING WORTH A HUNDRED 
VL-yalgea18 1147.83 1151.01 s0001 THEY'RE CHARGING UM SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT INTEREST 
VL-yalgea18 1151.01 1155.79 s0001 WHICH FOR THE OPTIMAL PREPARER IS WORTH MUCH LESS THAN A HUNDRED TO THE BANK 
VL-yalgea18 1155.79 1163.33 s0001 SO THE BANKS WOULDN'T DO THAT THEY WOULD JUST GO OUT OF BUSINESS IF THEY DID SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT THEY WOULDN'T DO THAT UNLESS THEY THOUGHT THAT THE WHOLE WARS WEREN'T ACTING 
VL-yalgea18 1163.33 1165.83 s0001 AT LEAST NOT ALL ONE ACTING OPTIMALLY 
VL-yalgea18 1165.83 1167.77 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea18 1167.78 1169.87 s0001 SUPPOSE YOU HAD TO PROJECT 
VL-yalgea18 1169.89 1172.08 s0001 HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
VL-yalgea18 1172.08 1173.48 s0001 ACT IN THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea18 1173.49 1176.78 s0001 AND YOU WANT TO TRADE ON THAT HOW WHAT WOULD YOU DO 
VL-yalgea18 1177.29 1179.79 s0001 HOW WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT PREDICTING IT 
VL-yalgea18 1179.79 1183.13 s0001 SO THIS IS THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE WHAT WOULD YOU GO WHAT WOULD YOU DO 
VL-yalgea18 1183.14 1184.58 s0001 YOU HAVE THIS DATA 
VL-yalgea18 1184.58 1195.59 s0001 THESE ARE EIGHT PERCENT THINGS ALSO NINE PERCENT MORTGAGES ISSUED THE YEAR BEFORE AND THEN MAYBE A YEAR BEFORE THAT THERE WERE A HALF PERCENT INTEREST YOU HAVE BAD HISTORY YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE DIFFERENT POOLS AND ALWAYS DIFFERENT 
VL-yalgea18 1195.60 1196.74 s0001 HISTORIES 
VL-yalgea18 1196.74 1198.43 s0001 HOW WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT 
VL-yalgea18 1198.43 1200.54 s0001 FIGURING OUT A 
VL-yalgea18 1200.66 1202.40 s0001 A PREPAYMENT 
VL-yalgea18 1202.49 1205.03 s0001 HOW WOULD YOU PREDICT PREPAYMENT 
VL-yalgea18 1206.73 1208.12 s0001 WELL 
VL-yalgea18 1208.13 1212.76 s0001 THE WAY ECONOMISTS MACRO ECONOMIST AT LEAST IN THE OLD DAYS USED TO MAKE 
VL-yalgea18 1212.77 1213.95 s0001 PREDICTIONS 
VL-yalgea18 1213.95 1215.36 s0001 THEY WOULD SAY 
VL-yalgea18 1215.35 1216.53 s0001 ROOM 
VL-yalgea18 1216.54 1220.55 s0001 THE FIRST QUARTER LOOKS PRETTY GOOD NOW WHAT ARE THEY PREDICTING NOW 
VL-yalgea18 1220.56 1221.60 s0001 NOW THEY'RE SAYING 
VL-yalgea18 1221.61 1225.93 s0001 UNEMPLOYMENT IS PROBABLY GOING TO KEEP RISING FOR THE NEXT QUARTER OR TWO 
VL-yalgea18 1225.95 1228.82 s0001 BUT STILL WELL UNTIL THE NEXT YEAR 
VL-yalgea18 1228.83 1231.39 s0001 BUT AT THAT POINT THINGS ARE GOING TO TURN AROUND 
VL-yalgea18 1231.41 1234.00 s0001 AND WE EXPECT THE ECONOMY TO GET STRONGER 
VL-yalgea18 1234.01 1241.02 s0001 COME OUT OF ITS RECESSION AND UNEMPLOYMENT SHOULD GRADUALLY IMPROVE FROM ITS HIGH WHICH WE EXPECT WILL BE TEN AND A HALF PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1241.03 1243.37 s0001 TO SOMETHING BACK DOWN TO SIX PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1243.39 1248.52 s0001 BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT'S MORE OR LESS THE ECONOMY'S PREDICTION NOW 
VL-yalgea18 1248.53 1255.87 s0001 CAN YOU MAKE A PREDICTION LIKE THAT ABOUT PREPAYMENT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO MAKE A PREDICTION ABOUT THAT WHY IS THAT IT'S UTTERLY STUPID 
VL-yalgea18 1255.89 1257.38 s0001 KIND OF PREDICTION 
VL-yalgea18 1258.66 1261.65 s0001 WHAT IS THE ESSENCE OF GOOD PREDICTION 
VL-yalgea18 1262.92 1267.87 s0001 IF YOU WANT TO PREDICT SOMETHING AND YOU NEVER LOSE A LOT OF MONEY IF YOU PREDICTION WAS WRONG 
VL-yalgea18 1267.88 1269.02 s0001 HOW WOULD YOU 
VL-yalgea18 1269.03 1273.78 s0001 REFINE YOUR PREDICTION COMPARED TO WHAT I JUST GAVE IS A SAMPLE PREDICTION 
VL-yalgea18 1273.78 1276.25 s0001 YUP DO HERE 
VL-yalgea18 1277.15 1279.67 s0001 EXACTLY SO WHAT HE SAID IT IS 
VL-yalgea18 1279.68 1282.57 s0001 IF YOU'RE IN THE MOST SLIGHTEST BIT SOPHISTICATED 
VL-yalgea18 1282.58 1283.96 s0001 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE 
VL-yalgea18 1283.96 1285.80 s0001 HOW BALD 
VL-yalgea18 1285.81 1292.12 s0001 YOU KNOW NON CONTINGENT PREDICTION YOU KNOW THINGS ARE GOING TO GET WORSE THE NEXT TWO QUARTERS THEN THEY'RE GOING TO START GETTING BETTER 
VL-yalgea18 1292.14 1293.61 s0001 THEN AGAIN OR YOU KNOW 
VL-yalgea18 1293.60 1299.93 s0001 YOU KNOW TITANIUM THINGS ARE GOING TO GET AS WELL AS THEY'RE GOING TO GET AFTER TWO YEARS YOU'LL SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF TO TWO YEARS 
VL-yalgea18 1299.94 1305.08 s0001 YEAH WHAT HAPPENS IF ANOTHER WAR BREAKS OUT IRAQ WHATEVER RON BRAHMS ISRAEL 
VL-yalgea18 1305.08 1306.36 s0001 WHAT IF YOU ARE 
VL-yalgea18 1306.38 1309.56 s0001 ARE YOU KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER CRASH IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE 
VL-yalgea18 1309.56 1316.35 s0001 YOU KNOW HOW COULD THAT PREDICTION POSSIBLY TURN OUT TO BE TRUE IT'S A SHORT THING IT'S GOING TO BE WRONG IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE THAT CAN BE RIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 1316.36 1318.08 s0001 BECAUSE THE GUY MAKING THE PREDICTION 
VL-yalgea18 1318.09 1319.90 s0001 HAS MADE NO CONTINGENCIES 
VL-yalgea18 1319.91 1321.01 s0001 BUILT IN HIS PREDICTION 
VL-yalgea18 1321.02 1323.35 s0001 YOU KNOW LIKE I WAS MAKING A PREDICTION FOR FREE 
VL-yalgea18 1323.36 1327.83 s0001 M. SOMEONE'S MAYBE PAYING HIM TO HERE BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO BE PENALISED WAS PREDICTION IS WRONG 
VL-yalgea18 1327.84 1329.28 s0001 NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND 
VL-yalgea18 1329.29 1332.25 s0001 WOULD MAKE SUCH A PREDICTION SO THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO 
VL-yalgea18 1332.26 1333.83 s0001 IN PREDICTING PREPAYMENT 
VL-yalgea18 1333.84 1335.01 s0001 IS TO REALISE 
VL-yalgea18 1335.02 1338.02 s0001 BUT YOU'VE GOT A TREE OF POSSIBLE FUTURES 
VL-yalgea18 1338.02 1340.55 s0001 AND GIVEN THIS TREE OF POSSIBLE FUTURES 
VL-yalgea18 1340.56 1341.89 s0001 YOU'RE GOING TO PREDICT 
VL-yalgea18 1341.89 1345.99 s0001 DIFFERENT PREPAYMENT DEPENDING ON WHAT WHERE YOU GO ON THE TREE 
VL-yalgea18 1345.99 1349.56 s0001 OKAY SO YOU SEE PREDICTION IS NOT A SIMPLE ONE 
VL-yalgea18 1349.57 1350.78 s0001 ONE EVENT 
VL-yalgea18 1350.78 1353.14 s0001 IT'S NOT A ONE SHOT THING 
VL-yalgea18 1353.15 1355.14 s0001 JUST AS HE SO APTLY PUT IT 
VL-yalgea18 1355.15 1357.09 s0001 IT'S A MANY SCENARIO THING 
VL-yalgea18 1357.10 1359.56 s0001 YOU HAVE TO PREDICT OVER MANY MANY SCENARIOS 
VL-yalgea18 1359.56 1360.97 s0001 WHAT YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN 
VL-yalgea18 1360.98 1366.89 s0001 AND THAT MAKES YOUR PREDICTION MUCH BETTER BECAUSE OF COURSE IF THERE IS A WAR IN IRAQ AND THERE IS A CATASTROPHE IN AFGHANISTAN 
VL-yalgea18 1366.90 1372.17 s0001 AND IF LAURENT DOES BOMB ISRAEL AND IF THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET COLLAPSES 
VL-yalgea18 1372.17 1375.27 s0001 THINGS ARE GOING TO BE A LOT WORSE THAN THIS ORIGINAL GUYS PREDICTION 
VL-yalgea18 1375.28 1380.63 s0001 OKAY SO WHY NOT I MEAN EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT SO WHY NOT MAKE THE PREDICTION MORE SENSIBLE 
VL-yalgea18 1380.63 1382.08 s0001 OKAY SO THAT 
VL-yalgea18 1382.09 1387.17 s0001 ART SO ON WALL STREET THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY'S DONE FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT 
VL-yalgea18 1387.19 1388.23 s0001 FOUR 
VL-yalgea18 1388.24 1389.76 s0001 THIRTY YEARS IT'S JUST 
VL-yalgea18 1389.77 1391.62 s0001 TWENTY YEARS THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT 
VL-yalgea18 1391.63 1395.53 s0001 OKAY SO WHEN I GOT THE KILLER PEABODY IN NINETEEN NINETY 
VL-yalgea18 1395.53 1402.70 s0001 THEY WERE MAKING THESE ONE SCENARIO PREDICTIONS SO WE HAD TO CHANGE INSIDE THE I MEAN I SAW A LONG STORY WHICH OUT 
VL-yalgea18 1402.71 1404.55 s0001 TELL MAYBE SUNDAY NIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 1404.56 1408.24 s0001 I I I END UP IN CHARGE OF THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT AND SO WE 
VL-yalgea18 1408.25 1412.18 s0001 THEY YOUR OTHER FIRMS WERE DOING THIS ALREADY WE MADE SCENARIO PREDICTIONS OKAY 
VL-yalgea18 1412.19 1415.52 s0001 SO NOW WHAT KIND OF SCENARIO PREDICTIONS YOU GOING TO MAKE 
VL-yalgea18 1415.52 1416.83 s0001 WHEN YOU MAKE 
VL-yalgea18 1416.84 1421.05 s0001 CONTENTION PREDICTIONS TURN OFF A LOT OF THEM YOU CAN EVEN WRITE THEM ALL DOWN 
VL-yalgea18 1421.06 1423.98 s0001 SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE 
VL-yalgea18 1423.99 1425.03 s0001 A MODEL 
VL-yalgea18 1425.04 1429.02 s0001 SO WHAT KIND OF MODEL SHOULD YOU ARE SHOULD YOU HAVE 
VL-yalgea18 1429.03 1434.65 s0001 OKAY WELL I'LL TELL YOU NOW WHAT THE STANDARD GUYS WERE DOING ON WALL STREET AT THE TIME 
VL-yalgea18 1434.65 1436.48 s0001 THEY WERE SAYING 
VL-yalgea18 1437.46 1439.65 s0001 HERE'S INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea18 1440.40 1444.71 s0001 HERE'S THE PRESENT VALUE MORTGAGES ARE PRESENT VALUE WILL CALL WILL MORTGAGE 
VL-yalgea18 1444.71 1449.80 s0001 PRESENT ON ONE DOLLAR PRINCIPAL SO REALISTICALLY PAYMENTS SO WE GO OVER HERE 
VL-yalgea18 1449.80 1451.62 s0001 WILL SEE THAT 
VL-yalgea18 1451.63 1454.36 s0001 PEOPLE SAID LOOK FROM THIS GRAPH IT 
VL-yalgea18 1454.36 1458.22 s0001 CLEARER THEY WOULD SAY THAT WHEN INTEREST RATES WENT DOWN 
VL-yalgea18 1458.23 1459.98 s0001 PEOPLE THREE PAY MORE 
VL-yalgea18 1459.99 1461.75 s0001 SO WHY DON'T WE HAVE 
VL-yalgea18 1461.75 1463.26 s0001 A FUNCTION 
VL-yalgea18 1463.26 1464.60 s0001 THAT'S 
VL-yalgea18 1464.61 1465.79 s0001 AH 
VL-yalgea18 1465.80 1466.95 s0001 LOOKS LIKE 
VL-yalgea18 1466.96 1469.29 s0001 LET'S LET'S SAY THE PREACH SO 
VL-yalgea18 1469.29 1470.95 s0001 PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 1471.96 1474.28 s0001 THAT'S THE PERCENTAGE 
VL-yalgea18 1474.28 1477.33 s0001 PERCENTAGE OF REMAINING BALANCE 
VL-yalgea18 1477.53 1479.41 s0001 THAT IS PAID 
VL-yalgea18 1479.41 1480.95 s0001 PAY DARK 
VL-yalgea18 1482.59 1484.02 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea18 1484.03 1489.93 s0001 SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN REMEMBER AFTER YOU MADE YOUR COUPON PAYMENT YOUR REMAINING VALENTINO BE FIVE 
VL-yalgea18 1489.93 1491.24 s0001 YOU COULD PAY 
VL-yalgea18 1491.25 1493.38 s0001 ALL THAT ARE NONE OF IT OR HALF OF THAT 
VL-yalgea18 1493.39 1499.62 s0001 SO THAT THE PRE PAYING THE PREPAID IS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE BEEF I THAT'S JUST AFTER YOU'VE PAID 
VL-yalgea18 1499.63 1502.35 s0001 RIGHT SO LET ME TO DO THAT WOULD BE TOO 
VL-yalgea18 1502.36 1509.75 s0001 JUST AS YOU PAY THEY POINT EIGHT EIGHT REMAINING DOWNS HAS NOW BEEN REDUCED TO BE TOO YOU CAN ADDITIONALLY A POINT EIGHT EIGHT PAYOFF A LEADING TO 
VL-yalgea18 1509.76 1514.90 s0001 TYPICALLY SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE LAW WRITTEN THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME TO PREPARE WILL PAY ALL AGREED TO 
VL-yalgea18 1514.90 1517.49 s0001 OTHERS WILL PAY NONE OF BE TOO 
VL-yalgea18 1517.50 1520.71 s0001 SO WHO AGGREGATE OVER THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea18 1520.72 1524.52 s0001 THE PREPAID PERCENTAGES A LOT OF THE SUMS OF ALL THEIR B. TWOS 
VL-yalgea18 1524.53 1526.58 s0001 WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE GOING TO PAY OFF 
VL-yalgea18 1526.59 1532.01 s0001 SILLS SO WE LOOK AT THE AGGREGATE PREPAYMENT THAT'S THE OLD FASHIONED WAY AND WE SAY 
VL-yalgea18 1532.02 1534.75 s0001 WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE REMAINING BALANCES PAID OFF 
VL-yalgea18 1534.76 1538.48 s0001 AND TYPICALLY WHAT SO THAT YOU MAKE A FUNCTION LIKE THIS 
VL-yalgea18 1538.49 1541.41 s0001 YOU'D SAY WELL PREPAID MIGHT BE CALLED 
VL-yalgea18 1541.41 1542.60 s0001 TEN PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1542.60 1544.51 s0001 MY MY PICKING TEN PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1544.51 1547.29 s0001 SO IF YOU GO BACK TO THIS PICTURE 
VL-yalgea18 1547.29 1550.24 s0001 YOU SEE THAT PREPAYMENT SWORE 
VL-yalgea18 1553.86 1558.07 s0001 P. PAYMENTS YOU NOW SEEM TO BE AROUND TEN PERCENT WHEN NOTHING'S HAPPENING 
VL-yalgea18 1558.07 1560.17 s0001 OKAY SO YOU SAY TEN PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1560.19 1563.24 s0001 PLUS MAYBE GOING TO GET SOME MORE PREPAYMENT 
VL-yalgea18 1563.24 1567.00 s0001 OKAY SO YOU MIGHT WRITE WHILE THIS WROTE DOWN FUNCTIONS 
VL-yalgea18 1567.01 1568.73 s0001 PLUS THE MAN 
VL-yalgea18 1569.80 1574.91 s0001 WOMEN SAY POINT SIXTY BECAUSE IT NEVER SEEMS TO GET OVER SIXTY PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1574.93 1576.05 s0001 YOU LOOK AT THAT 
VL-yalgea18 1576.06 1578.37 s0001 THE AMERICANS OVER SIXTY PERCENT REALLY 
VL-yalgea18 1578.38 1580.50 s0001 SO THE MAN OF SIXTY 
VL-yalgea18 1581.39 1583.39 s0001 AND FIFTEEN 
VL-yalgea18 1583.40 1584.79 s0001 TIMES 
VL-yalgea18 1587.38 1589.38 s0001 FIFTEEN TIMES 
VL-yalgea18 1589.38 1591.53 s0001 A MAX 
VL-yalgea18 1591.69 1593.68 s0001 O. ZERO 
VL-yalgea18 1593.71 1596.86 s0001 AND AND MINUS FOUR OF US 
VL-yalgea18 1596.87 1598.85 s0001 MOLINA SIGNAL OVER ONE 
VL-yalgea18 1598.85 1599.93 s0001 THREE THREE 
VL-yalgea18 1599.94 1601.15 s0001 THAT WOULD BE 
VL-yalgea18 1601.15 1604.25 s0001 A KIND OF PREPAYMENT FUNCTIONS SO WHAT IS THIS A 
VL-yalgea18 1604.26 1605.37 s0001 IT SAYS 
VL-yalgea18 1605.37 1606.62 s0001 YOU PAY 
VL-yalgea18 1606.63 1608.39 s0001 IT SAYS OKAY WHAT HAPPENS 
VL-yalgea18 1608.40 1610.26 s0001 YOU'RE NORMALLY GOING TO PAY 
VL-yalgea18 1610.43 1612.89 s0001 SO THERE'S THIS WHOLE FUNCTION HERE 
VL-yalgea18 1612.90 1614.95 s0001 FIVE I SHOULD WRITE THIS IS 
VL-yalgea18 1614.96 1619.22 s0001 POINT ONE PLUS YOU CAN READ CAN YOU SEE THAT OVER THERE MAYBE NOT SO 
VL-yalgea18 1619.23 1621.81 s0001 UM THIS PLUS POINT ONE 
VL-yalgea18 1621.91 1625.09 s0001 OKAY SO THERE'S A BASELINE OF TEN PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1625.09 1626.59 s0001 HERE AND 
VL-yalgea18 1626.59 1637.36 s0001 IF THE INTEREST RATE IS HIGH SO THE INTEREST RATE IS ABOVE THE MORTGAGE RATE NO ONE ELSE IS GOING TO PREPAID BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE A NEGATIVE NUMBER AND THIS WILL BE ZERO TO JUST GOING TO DO UM 
VL-yalgea18 1637.37 1638.90 s0001 POINT ONE PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1638.91 1640.38 s0001 OKAY 
VL-yalgea18 1640.39 1644.26 s0001 ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE INTEREST RATE GETS LOW AND FALLS FAR ENOUGH 
VL-yalgea18 1644.26 1646.03 s0001 ALL THE MORTGAGE RATES 
VL-yalgea18 1646.04 1648.03 s0001 PEOPLE GOING TO SAVE THEMSELVES A HOP 
VL-yalgea18 1648.04 1655.01 s0001 EITHER BIG INCENTIVE TO PREPAID NOW MAYBE THING INTEREST RATES HAVE GONE DOWN SO FAR I CAN NO LONGER HOPE TO GO BACK UP ABOVE THE MORTGAGE RATE 
VL-yalgea18 1655.02 1657.74 s0001 I SHOULD STOP I SHOULD START PREPPING MORE 
VL-yalgea18 1657.75 1659.63 s0001 SO MORE PEOPLE THAN A PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 1659.64 1661.24 s0001 AND THIS THING IS GOING TO GO UP 
VL-yalgea18 1661.25 1663.72 s0001 YOU KNOW I JUST MULTIPLY IT BY SOME CONSTANT 
VL-yalgea18 1663.73 1665.49 s0001 OKAY AND ARE 
VL-yalgea18 1665.50 1667.91 s0001 BUT I'LL NEVER GO UP MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1667.92 1670.10 s0001 AS WITH THIS FUNCTION SAYS AND SIGMA 
VL-yalgea18 1670.11 1672.07 s0001 THIS IS THE VOLATILITY 
VL-yalgea18 1672.73 1678.28 s0001 THEY SEEM RIGHT SO LET'S JUST LEAVE THAT ASIDE SO THERE'S A PREPAYMENT FUNCTION THAT SEEMS TO SORT OF 
VL-yalgea18 1678.28 1679.93 s0001 CAPTURE WHAT'S GOING ON 
VL-yalgea18 1679.93 1688.69 s0001 IT'S USUALLY AROUND TEN PERCENT THERE'S NO INCENTIVE THAT NEVER GETS ABOVE SIXTY PERCENT AS THE INCENTIVE TO PREPARE HIS INTEREST RATES GET LOWER AN INCENTIVE TO REPAY INCREASES 
VL-yalgea18 1688.70 1690.40 s0001 MORE MORE PEOPLE PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 1690.41 1691.98 s0001 THAT'S KIND OF THE IDEA 
VL-yalgea18 1691.98 1693.80 s0001 RIGHT AND THEN YOU WOULD 
VL-yalgea18 1693.81 1696.16 s0001 FAYETTE FANCIER CURVES THE MAC 
VL-yalgea18 1696.17 1698.85 s0001 YOU WOULD LIKE IT AM MINUS R. T. V. 
VL-yalgea18 1698.86 1705.61 s0001 AND YOU WOULD FIT A CURVE YOU KNOW THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS SO IT WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AN INCENTIVE TO PREPAID RATE OR A LITTLE BIT LOWER MORTGAGE RATES 
VL-yalgea18 1705.62 1708.19 s0001 NOBODY DOES IT THEN QUICKLY A LOT OF PEOPLE DO IT 
VL-yalgea18 1708.21 1709.69 s0001 AND THEN I STOPPED DOING IT 
VL-yalgea18 1709.70 1713.84 s0001 SO THIS IS LIKE SIXTY PERCENT AND YOU KNOW MOST OF THE TIME AROUND TEN PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1713.84 1721.66 s0001 AND ARE GOING TO TRY AND FIT THIS CURVE YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PARAMETERS AND SINCE YOU'RE SO MUCH DATA YOU COULD FIT PARAMETERS OF THE OLD FASHIONED WAY 
VL-yalgea18 1721.68 1723.47 s0001 AND THAT'S HOW PEOPLE WOULD PREDICT 
VL-yalgea18 1723.47 1725.51 s0001 A PREPAYMENT 
VL-yalgea18 1725.52 1730.58 s0001 NOW THAT'S NOT GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE SUCH A GREAT WAY BUT IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY TEACHES YOU SOMETHING 
VL-yalgea18 1730.59 1733.04 s0001 SO LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU NOW 
VL-yalgea18 1733.05 1735.25 s0001 WITH THOSE REALISTICALLY PAYMENTS 
VL-yalgea18 1735.25 1736.69 s0001 YOU COMPUTE 
VL-yalgea18 1736.70 1741.08 s0001 THE VALUE OF A MORTGAGE SO BUT THIS IS THE PREPAYMENT THAT YOU GET 
VL-yalgea18 1741.09 1744.64 s0001 FOR THE DIFFERENT RATES AND SO YOU CAN SEE THAT AS THE RATES GO DOWN 
VL-yalgea18 1744.65 1746.19 s0001 ARMED 
VL-yalgea18 1746.90 1750.23 s0001 THE RATES GO DOWN THE TOTAL PREPAYMENT IS GOING UP 
VL-yalgea18 1750.24 1756.97 s0001 BY THE WAY IT'S MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THIS TEN PERCENT ADDED TO THE SIXTY PERCENT OF THE MOST IT COULD BE A SEVENTY PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1756.98 1758.54 s0001 WHICH IT HITS OVER HERE 
VL-yalgea18 1758.55 1764.16 s0001 SO YOU GET SEVENTY PERCENT IS THE MAXIMUM PREPAYMENT SAYING YOU KNOW AS INTEREST RATES GET HIGHER 
VL-yalgea18 1764.18 1766.57 s0001 THEY HAD NO ONE PRIX PACE EXCEPT 
VL-yalgea18 1766.58 1770.82 s0001 THE TEN PERCENT OF GUYS BY THE WIRE PEOPLE P. PAYING OVER HERE 
VL-yalgea18 1770.83 1772.80 s0001 EVEN WHEN THE RATES ARE SO HIGH 
VL-yalgea18 1772.80 1774.70 s0001 IT'S BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE MOVING 
VL-yalgea18 1774.71 1777.30 s0001 ARE GETTING DIVORCED AND HAVE TO SELL THEIR HOUSE 
VL-yalgea18 1777.31 1780.57 s0001 SO OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME PREPAYMENT NO MATTER WHAT 
VL-yalgea18 1780.58 1782.19 s0001 PEOPLE HAVE TO PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 1782.21 1786.83 s0001 AND WHY IS THAT THE PEOPLE NEVER PREPAID MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT HISTORICALLY OR SEVENTY PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 1786.84 1788.64 s0001 BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY PAYS ATTENTION 
VL-yalgea18 1788.65 1791.75 s0001 I CALL THEM A DUMB GUYS LAST TIME BUT AS I SAID 
VL-yalgea18 1791.75 1801.02 s0001 YOU KNOW I PROBABLY FIT INTO THAT CATEGORY IT'S PEOPLE WERE DISTRACTED AND DOING OTHER THINGS ARE JUST NOT PAYING ATTENTION AND SO THEY DON'T REALISE YOUR KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON DON'T REALISE THEY SHOULD BE CREEPING 
VL-yalgea18 1801.03 1805.29 s0001 SO AS INTEREST RATES GO DOWN MORE PEOPLE PRETTY PAYS INTEREST RATE GOES UP LESS PEOPLE PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 1805.30 1808.18 s0001 AND IF YOU DID SOME HISTORICAL PLAYING 
VL-yalgea18 1808.19 1816.22 s0001 AND YOU DON'T FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT PARAMETERS YOU GET A PREPAYMENT FUNCTION SO YOU HOW DO I FIGURE OUT THIS WAS FIFTEEN HOW DO I FIGURE OUT THIS WAS POINT SIX 
VL-yalgea18 1816.22 1819.42 s0001 WHY SHOULD I DIVIDE THIS BY ONE THIRTY THREE WHAT SIGMA 
VL-yalgea18 1819.43 1821.78 s0001 OKAY ONCE YOU GET THOSE PARAMETERS HISTORICALLY 
VL-yalgea18 1821.79 1824.26 s0001 YOU NOW HAVE A WELL DETERMINED 
VL-yalgea18 1824.26 1827.77 s0001 A BEHAVIOR RULED WHAT PEOPLE GOING PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 1827.78 1829.53 s0001 AND FROM THAT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT 
VL-yalgea18 1829.53 1832.74 s0001 WHAT THE PRICES ARE OF ANY MORTGAGE BY BACKWARD INDUCTION 
VL-yalgea18 1832.75 1836.58 s0001 SO HOW WOULD YOU DO IT AGAIN BUYBACK OF INDUCTION THE SAME WAY WE ALWAYS DID IT 
VL-yalgea18 1836.58 1838.69 s0001 OVER HERE 
VL-yalgea18 1839.46 1842.52 s0001 OKAY WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU DO OVER HERE 
VL-yalgea18 1842.53 1844.69 s0001 HOW WOULD YOU CHANGE THIS RULE 
VL-yalgea18 1853.27 1857.32 s0001 WELL YOU WOULD JUST BE FEEDING AND THE PREPAYMENT FUNCTION 
VL-yalgea18 1857.33 1859.09 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea18 1866.39 1868.88 s0001 SO WHAT WOULD THE PREPAYMENT FUNCTION ME 
VL-yalgea18 1868.89 1874.30 s0001 WELL PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE DOING A MINIMUM HERE RIGHT OR NOT DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT A PREPAID THEY'RE JUST PRETTY PAIN 
VL-yalgea18 1874.30 1875.60 s0001 SO 
VL-yalgea18 1875.61 1877.52 s0001 SO LET'S GET RID OF THAT 
VL-yalgea18 1877.52 1879.05 s0001 THEIR PRE PAIN 
VL-yalgea18 1879.05 1883.85 s0001 SOME OF THEM ARE SO THIS IS THE VALUE OF THE DOLLARS LEFT OF PRINCIPLE 
VL-yalgea18 1883.85 1885.80 s0001 SO SOME OF THEM ARE PRETTY PAYING 
VL-yalgea18 1885.81 1887.29 s0001 AND THAT'S THE FUNCTION 
VL-yalgea18 1887.30 1891.00 s0001 SO PREPAID AND THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT KNOW YOU'RE AT 
VL-yalgea18 1891.01 1893.34 s0001 AND HERE IT SAYS WHAT FRACTION 
VL-yalgea18 1893.35 1896.54 s0001 WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE REMAINING DOWNS AS BEING PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 1896.54 1899.42 s0001 SO THAT TELLS YOU THAT ALL THOSE PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 1899.42 1901.37 s0001 AND THEN WITH THE REST OF THE MONEY 
VL-yalgea18 1901.38 1903.54 s0001 THAT'S GOING UNTIL NEXT TIME 
VL-yalgea18 1903.55 1907.45 s0001 ONE MINUS THAT SAME THING ONE MINUS PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 1907.90 1910.61 s0001 FINALLY EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD BEFORE 
VL-yalgea18 1913.78 1920.22 s0001 OKAY SO THIS PART OF THE DOLLAR GOT PREPAID IMMEDIATELY SO THAT'S THE CASH THAT WENT TO THE MORTGAGE HOLDER 
VL-yalgea18 1920.23 1921.52 s0001 THE REST OF THE CASH 
VL-yalgea18 1921.53 1923.62 s0001 THAT SAME TILL NEXT I 
VL-yalgea18 1923.63 1925.47 s0001 AND HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS TO IT 
VL-yalgea18 1928.18 1933.96 s0001 OKAY YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR COUPON VIDEO REMAINING BALANCE AND THEN WHATEVER'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS GOING TO HAPPEN 
VL-yalgea18 1938.27 1947.84 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S THE AH OKAY SO DOING THAT BY SO YOU'LL STUDY THIS WE'LL FIGURE OUT WE UNSURE WITH YOU KNOW TAKES LITTLE EFFORT TO SEE THE REAL BUT 
VL-yalgea18 1947.85 1952.56 s0001 WITH HALF AN HOUR STARING AT IT YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS AND YOU'LL READ A SPREADSHEET 
VL-yalgea18 1952.57 1955.49 s0001 SO YOU CAN FIGURE OUT THE VALUE VERY OF A MORTGAGE 
VL-yalgea18 1955.49 1958.08 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S THAT'S A 
VL-yalgea18 1958.08 1965.24 s0001 YOU KNOW YOU GET A VALUABLE MORTGAGE OKAY AND NOW WE COULD START DOING EXPANDS BY CHANGING THE PARAMETERS AND SEE HOW THE MORTGAGE WORKS 
VL-yalgea18 1965.25 1968.35 s0001 NOW BEFORE I DO THAT I WANT TO SAY THAT THAT 
VL-yalgea18 1968.35 1970.62 s0001 THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS 
VL-yalgea18 1970.63 1973.27 s0001 OKAY I MAYBE THESE NUMBERS ARE ESTIMATED 
VL-yalgea18 1973.28 1977.18 s0001 WHERE INTEREST RATES THAN WHAT'S A BETTER WAY OF DOING IT SO HOW HOW I 
VL-yalgea18 1977.19 1979.42 s0001 HOW DO I DO HAVE ELLINGTON HOW DO WE 
VL-yalgea18 1979.42 1980.47 s0001 I MEAN AT AT 
VL-yalgea18 1980.48 1983.19 s0001 PETER PEABODY HOW DO WE PREDICT REPAYMENTS 
VL-yalgea18 1983.19 1985.83 s0001 WHAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT AT A 
VL-yalgea18 1985.83 1987.46 s0001 PREPAYMENT SOME WHY 
VL-yalgea18 1987.47 1990.90 s0001 YOU COULD IT SO LET ME LET ME LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT'S MISSING 
VL-yalgea18 1990.90 1992.56 s0001 SUPPOSE THAT 
VL-yalgea18 1992.56 1993.90 s0001 UM 
VL-yalgea18 1993.91 1999.20 s0001 I USED TO ASK PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK IT AT THE KILLER PEABODY ARE GOING TO MOVE FOLLOWING LITTLE 
VL-yalgea18 1999.21 2000.42 s0001 SIMPLE PUZZLE 
VL-yalgea18 2000.42 2005.65 s0001 AND MOST OF THE GENIUS MATHEMATICIANS ALWAYS GOT THIS ANSWER WRONG ON 
VL-yalgea18 2005.66 2009.20 s0001 COURSE WE HIRED HIM ANYWAY BUT THEY DON'T GET THIS WRONG SO THE QUESTION IS 
VL-yalgea18 2009.21 2010.72 s0001 SUPPOSE YOU'VE GOT A GROUP 
VL-yalgea18 2010.73 2012.83 s0001 PEOPLE LIKE THIS 
VL-yalgea18 2012.84 2017.03 s0001 OKAY AND YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT THE VALUE THE MORTGAGES 
VL-yalgea18 2017.04 2019.72 s0001 AND INTEREST RATES OF INCONSTANT ALL THIS TIME 
VL-yalgea18 2019.72 2024.77 s0001 LET'S SUPPOSE FOR ONE MONTH INTEREST RATES SHOOT UP SHOULD DOWN INTEREST RATES COLLAPSE 
VL-yalgea18 2024.77 2028.27 s0001 AND HALF THE POLL SIXTY PERCENT OF THE POOL DISAPPEARS 
VL-yalgea18 2028.28 2031.84 s0001 SO NOW YOU'VE ONLY GOT FORTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE LEFT YOU HAVE BEFORE 
VL-yalgea18 2031.85 2034.67 s0001 AND THEN INTEREST RATE RETURN TO EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE 
VL-yalgea18 2034.69 2035.81 s0001 TO BEGIN WITH 
VL-yalgea18 2035.82 2036.93 s0001 OKAY SHOULD THEM 
VL-yalgea18 2036.95 2038.38 s0001 POOL ALL THAT'S LEFT 
VL-yalgea18 2038.38 2040.51 s0001 BE WORTH FORTY PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 2040.52 2042.64 s0001 OF THE POOL THAT YOU HAD JUST HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2042.64 2045.56 s0001 OR MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT LESS THAN FORTY PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 2045.57 2048.56 s0001 SO REMEMBER YOU HAD A HUNDRED PEOPLE HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2048.56 2050.92 s0001 YOU'RE THE BANKERS LENT THE MONEY 
VL-yalgea18 2050.92 2053.98 s0001 YOU KNOW YOUR VALUE IN THE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS ARE GONNA MAKE TO YOU 
VL-yalgea18 2054.00 2056.23 s0001 BEGINNING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM UM 
VL-yalgea18 2056.23 2059.64 s0001 SIXTY PERCENT OF THEM SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED IN ONE LONG 
VL-yalgea18 2059.65 2061.18 s0001 LEAVING FORTY LAUGHED 
VL-yalgea18 2061.19 2064.39 s0001 BUT NOW INTEREST RATES ARE BACK EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE 
VL-yalgea18 2064.40 2068.31 s0001 NOW THE MORGAN STARTING HERE WITH THE FORTY PERCENT POOL 
VL-yalgea18 2068.31 2072.87 s0001 WORTH FORTY PERCENT OF WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OR LESS THAN FORTY PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 2072.87 2074.15 s0001 WHEN YOU THINK 
VL-yalgea18 2074.15 2075.77 s0001 YES 
VL-yalgea18 2083.61 2085.01 s0001 EXACTLY 
VL-yalgea18 2085.02 2089.96 s0001 SO THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT POINT IT'S CALLED THE OPPOSITE OF ADVERSE SELECTION 
VL-yalgea18 2089.96 2093.76 s0001 EVERY ONE OF THESE EVENTS IS SELECTING THE PEOPLE LAUGHED 
VL-yalgea18 2093.77 2095.69 s0001 NOT ADVERSELY 
VL-yalgea18 2095.69 2099.33 s0001 WAS HE NOT PERVERSELY WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF AND IT'S NOT 
VL-yalgea18 2099.34 2108.89 s0001 FAVOURABLY TO YOU SO THE GUYS WILL AFTER ALL LOSERS WITH THAT SO YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH YOU DON'T WANT TO STUDY IN ALL TRADE WITH THE GENIUSES YOU WANT TO TRADE WITH THE GUYS NOT PAYING ANY ATTENTION 
VL-yalgea18 2108.90 2113.09 s0001 SO THE GUYS LAUGHTER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NEVER GOING TO PREPARE HARDLY EVER GONNA PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 2113.10 2114.56 s0001 AND SO IT'S MUCH BETTER 
VL-yalgea18 2114.57 2118.42 s0001 NOW THIS FUNCTION DOESN'T CAPTURE THAT AT ALL 
VL-yalgea18 2118.42 2120.96 s0001 RIGHT IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING IT JUST SAYS 
VL-yalgea18 2120.96 2123.25 s0001 YOUR PREPAYMENT DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE 
VL-yalgea18 2123.26 2125.38 s0001 SO YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2125.39 2126.56 s0001 OR HERE OR 
VL-yalgea18 2126.58 2128.69 s0001 ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE SAME PREPAYMENT 
VL-yalgea18 2128.69 2132.87 s0001 BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE CASE IN FACT IT'S CLEAR THAT OVER HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2132.88 2135.06 s0001 THE MOST OF THEM A MUCH BIGGER INCENTIVE 
VL-yalgea18 2135.07 2140.79 s0001 THAT WAS OVER THERE SO THE PREPAYMENT SO THE SAME BUT ACTUALLY INTEREST RATES HERE WERE VASTLY LOWER THAN INTEREST RATES 
VL-yalgea18 2140.80 2141.87 s0001 THERE 
VL-yalgea18 2141.87 2143.21 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea18 2143.23 2146.44 s0001 SO THIS IS NOT SUCH A GOOD FUNCTIONS SO HOW WOULD YOU 
VL-yalgea18 2146.46 2150.81 s0001 IMPROVE WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AS ADVERSE SELECTION ACTUALLY 
VL-yalgea18 2150.81 2152.85 s0001 PRO VERSE SELECTION 
VL-yalgea18 2152.92 2155.25 s0001 WHAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF ADVERSE 
VL-yalgea18 2156.88 2159.58 s0001 OKAY WELL 
VL-yalgea18 2159.58 2162.81 s0001 OKAY SO HOW WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD YOU THING TO DO 
VL-yalgea18 2162.87 2168.98 s0001 YOU KNOW YOUR WHOLE LIVELIHOOD DEPENDS ON IF YOU ARE MILLIONS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT STAKE HERE YOU'VE GOT A MODEL 
VL-yalgea18 2168.98 2171.98 s0001 PREPAYMENT CORRECTLY SO HOW WOULD YOU THINK OF A DOING THIS 
VL-yalgea18 2172.00 2175.13 s0001 GIVING YOU SOME SENSE OF WHAT A HEDGE FUND DOES WHAT EVERYONE 
VL-yalgea18 2175.13 2177.09 s0001 IT WAS MARKET WOULD HAVE TO DO 
VL-yalgea18 2177.09 2178.98 s0001 MOST OF THEM DID THAT'S 
VL-yalgea18 2178.98 2182.27 s0001 COURSE THEY GOT OKAY SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO 
VL-yalgea18 2182.46 2184.19 s0001 YEAH 
VL-yalgea18 2186.50 2188.31 s0001 A CAR 
VL-yalgea18 2192.27 2194.71 s0001 IT WHERE YOU WOULD BUY IT UP WHERE 
VL-yalgea18 2195.69 2198.21 s0001 RIGHT HERE YOU BUY IT UP RIGHT THERE 
VL-yalgea18 2198.21 2199.80 s0001 OKAY BUT 
VL-yalgea18 2200.52 2203.02 s0001 WHAT MODEL WOULD YOU USE TO PREDICT 
VL-yalgea18 2203.02 2204.79 s0001 PREPAYMENT SNOT THIS ONE 
VL-yalgea18 2204.80 2208.10 s0001 WHAT SO WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO DO OR HOW WOULD YOU 
VL-yalgea18 2208.10 2209.54 s0001 IMAGINE DOING IT 
VL-yalgea18 2209.54 2214.23 s0001 YOU'D IMAGINE MAKING A MODEL JUST LIKE YOUR INTUITION SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DOING 
VL-yalgea18 2218.69 2223.53 s0001 SOMEONE'S ASKING YOU TO RUN A RESEARCH DEPARTMENT MAKE A MODEL FORECASTING PREPAYMENT 
VL-yalgea18 2223.54 2231.96 s0001 ALL THE DATA YOU HAVE AS AGGREGATE DATA LIKE THAT YOU CAN'T OBSERVE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS IN THOSE DAYS THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME THE INFORMATION I'LL EXPLAIN ALL THAT SUNDAY NIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 2231.98 2234.02 s0001 SO THIS IS THE KIND OF DATA YOU HAVE 
VL-yalgea18 2234.03 2235.71 s0001 YOU KNOW WHAT THE AVERAGE 
VL-yalgea18 2235.71 2239.04 s0001 WHAT THE WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE IS DOING EVERY YEAR 
VL-yalgea18 2239.05 2241.34 s0001 ALL YOU DO TO BUILD A MODEL 
VL-yalgea18 2245.29 2248.27 s0001 ADVERSE SELECTION IS VERY IMPORTANT OR 
VL-yalgea18 2248.28 2250.73 s0001 PRO VERSE SELECTION I AM REALLY FREE IS 
VL-yalgea18 2250.73 2252.25 s0001 THEIR SINGER OF THE WORD 
VL-yalgea18 2252.27 2253.66 s0001 FAVOURABLE SELECTION 
VL-yalgea18 2253.67 2257.12 s0001 VERY IMPORTANT THINGS SO HOW WOULD YOU CAPTURE THAT YOUR MODEL 
VL-yalgea18 2261.69 2265.42 s0001 OKAY SO MAYBE ANOTHER THING YOU COULD DO 
VL-yalgea18 2265.44 2267.39 s0001 NOW HE'S GOING TO START 
VL-yalgea18 2267.40 2270.31 s0001 WHAT IF YOU INSTEAD OF HAVING 
VL-yalgea18 2270.32 2277.02 s0001 HAVING THIS FUNCTION THAT SAYS WHAT THE AGGREGATES GOING TO DO ALL THE DATA IS AGGREGATES ALL YOU CAN DO IS TEST AGAINST AGGREGATE DATA 
VL-yalgea18 2277.03 2278.39 s0001 BUT SUPPOSE YOU WERE 
VL-yalgea18 2278.40 2282.34 s0001 YOU YOU SAID OKAY WORLD ALL WE CAN SEE IS THE AGGREGATE 
VL-yalgea18 2282.35 2288.48 s0001 BOYLE THE PEOPLE REALLY ACTING OR INDIVIDUALS ACTING NOT THE AGGREGATE IT'S THE SUM OF INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITIES 
VL-yalgea18 2288.48 2292.25 s0001 SO WHAT WE SHOULD DO NOW IS HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea18 2292.27 2294.53 s0001 OKAY SO GOSH SORRY 
VL-yalgea18 2294.54 2296.05 s0001 IS THERE ALREADY 
VL-yalgea18 2296.14 2298.08 s0001 OH NO 
VL-yalgea18 2298.82 2301.54 s0001 LET'S GO BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE 
VL-yalgea18 2301.54 2303.65 s0001 OKAY SO REALISTIC 
VL-yalgea18 2306.83 2310.37 s0001 OKAY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU OUGHT TO SAY WELL 
VL-yalgea18 2310.38 2311.83 s0001 EIGHT PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 2312.66 2317.81 s0001 OKAY REMEMBER WE HAD TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE ALREADY YOU'VE ALREADY GOT TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE SORRY 
VL-yalgea18 2317.82 2319.39 s0001 WE'VE GOT 
VL-yalgea18 2319.61 2321.03 s0001 THESE GUYS 
VL-yalgea18 2321.04 2322.54 s0001 THE GUYS WHO NEVER CALL 
VL-yalgea18 2322.55 2324.97 s0001 SO THEY'RE PEOPLE YEAH THAT'S A KIND OF PERSON 
VL-yalgea18 2324.96 2329.10 s0001 AND SUPPOSE YOU GO DOWN HERE OR ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OPTIMALLY PRIX PAYING 
VL-yalgea18 2329.10 2331.54 s0001 SUPPOSE YOU IMAGINE THAT HALF THE PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea18 2331.55 2335.64 s0001 A PULLEY PREPARING AND HALF THE PEOPLE NEVER PREPAID WELL 
VL-yalgea18 2335.65 2338.98 s0001 WITH THAT EXPLAIN THIS FAVOURABLE SELECTION 
VL-yalgea18 2338.98 2341.27 s0001 ABSOLUTELY THEY WOULD EXPLAIN IT 
VL-yalgea18 2341.28 2346.88 s0001 BECAUSE WHEN YOU WENT TO YOUR LITTLE THREE ANYONE HERE AND HERE AND HERE AND HERE ARE 
VL-yalgea18 2347.55 2349.88 s0001 BY THE TIME YOU GOT DOWN HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2349.89 2351.21 s0001 ALL THOSE 
VL-yalgea18 2351.21 2355.14 s0001 PEOPLE ALL THE ALL THE OPTIMAL PREPARES THEY'RE ALL PRETTY PAYING 
VL-yalgea18 2355.15 2356.72 s0001 SO YOU START OFF WITH HALF 
VL-yalgea18 2356.71 2359.31 s0001 OPTIMAL GUYS AND HALF ASLEEP GUYS 
VL-yalgea18 2359.32 2360.74 s0001 ONCE YOU GET DOWN HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2360.75 2364.39 s0001 ALL THE OPTIMAL GUYS HAVE DISAPPEARED IN THE POOL THAT'S LEFT IS ALL SWEET 
VL-yalgea18 2364.40 2366.98 s0001 SO OF COURSE THE POOLS WORTH MUCH MORE HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2366.98 2371.33 s0001 YOU KNOW GIVEN THE INTEREST RATE THAT WAS ALREADY IN FACT IF IT GOES BACK THEN 
VL-yalgea18 2371.34 2372.38 s0001 AGAIN 
VL-yalgea18 2372.39 2373.52 s0001 HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2373.53 2375.42 s0001 YOU KNOW WHERE IT WAS BEFORE 
VL-yalgea18 2375.42 2377.24 s0001 SO I THAT'S SAME LINE 
VL-yalgea18 2377.25 2378.94 s0001 GOES BACK TO HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2378.96 2386.41 s0001 BUT ON THIS RIGHT NOW I GOTTA GO BACK TWICE HERE AND HERE SO ONCE IT GOES BACK HERE FOR GOES HERE HERE HERE IN HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2386.41 2390.64 s0001 OKAY THEN THE POOL IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE VALUABLE HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2390.65 2395.57 s0001 THEN IT STARTED THE OTHER HALF AS MANY PEOPLE BUT IT'S WORTH MUCH MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT WAS THERE 
VL-yalgea18 2395.58 2398.56 s0001 OKAY SO THE WAY TO DO THIS IS TOO 
VL-yalgea18 2398.58 2410.84 s0001 BREAK SO THEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUALS YOU'RE SAYING ONE CLASS OF PEOPLE'S VERY SMART THE OTHER CLASS OF PEOPLE'S ONCE CLASS OF PEOPLE'S VERY WORK MUCH BETTER WORD ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE VERY ALERT ONE PASS OF PEOPLE'S VERY ON ALERT 
VL-yalgea18 2410.85 2415.04 s0001 AND AS YOU GO SO THE TREE THERE WERE PEOPLE GOING TO DISAPPEAR FASTER THAN ME 
VL-yalgea18 2415.05 2420.24 s0001 NON ALERT PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHY YOU GOING TO HAVE A FAVORABLE SELECTION OF PEOPLE WHOSE LEFT IN THE POOL 
VL-yalgea18 2420.25 2421.64 s0001 OKAY WELL OF COURSE 
VL-yalgea18 2421.65 2425.21 s0001 THERE'S NO EXTREMES OF PERFECTLY RATIONAL ARE PERFECTLY 
VL-yalgea18 2425.21 2426.29 s0001 ALL 
VL-yalgea18 2426.30 2431.16 s0001 YOU KNOW ASLEEP IN THE ECONOMY SO WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE IN BETWEEN 
VL-yalgea18 2431.17 2435.78 s0001 YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU MAKE THEM IN BETWEEN WELL SUPPOSE THAT 
VL-yalgea18 2435.79 2439.77 s0001 FOR EXAMPLE WHILE INTO ONE THING SUPPOSE IT'S COSTLY TO PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 2439.79 2443.14 s0001 SOME PEOPLE JUST SAY NUANCES YOU TAKE A WHOLE DAY OFF OF WORK 
VL-yalgea18 2443.15 2446.19 s0001 I'M NOT GOING TO WRITE MY PAPER I MIGHT LOSE SOME 
VL-yalgea18 2446.19 2454.71 s0001 BUSINESS I WAS GOING TO DO THAT AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF UM LOSING SO UNLESS I THINK YOU KNOW I'M AN SUBTRACT THAT THE COULD YOU I'M NOT GOING TO PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 2454.71 2456.31 s0001 I CAN EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING IT 
VL-yalgea18 2456.32 2457.62 s0001 UNLESS I CAN GET 
VL-yalgea18 2457.63 2460.10 s0001 AT LEAST A CERTAIN BENEFIT FROM HAVING DONE IT 
VL-yalgea18 2460.11 2464.38 s0001 OKAY SO YOU CAN AT A COST OF PREPARING AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE PAID LESS 
VL-yalgea18 2464.38 2466.81 s0001 AGAIN THAT THEY HAVE BY PREPPING 
VL-yalgea18 2466.81 2468.21 s0001 EXCEEDS 
VL-yalgea18 2468.21 2472.77 s0001 LET'S LOOK AT THE COST OF DOING THE PREPAYMENT SO TO TAKE THE SIMPLEST CASE LET'S SUPPOSE 
VL-yalgea18 2472.79 2478.06 s0001 VERY ACTIVE NEVER MIND THE THINKING AND ALL THAT THE VERY ACTIVE CREATE PAIN GOING TO THE BANK 
VL-yalgea18 2478.07 2479.66 s0001 LITERALLY COST YOU MONEY 
VL-yalgea18 2479.67 2480.87 s0001 SO IF YOU HAVE 
VL-yalgea18 2480.87 2488.71 s0001 YOU KNOW A VALUE OF THE THING IS A HUNDRED AND YOU CAN PREPAID IF YOU DO YOUR CALCULATIONS AND DON'T PREPAID TODAY IT'S WORTH NINETY EIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 2488.71 2492.21 s0001 IF YOU PREPAID TODAY THE REMAINING BALANCES NINETY FOUR 
VL-yalgea18 2492.23 2497.10 s0001 YOU'RE SAVING FOUR DOLLARS BUT IF THE COST OF PREPAYMENT IS FIVE YOU'RE STILL I COULDN'T DO IT 
VL-yalgea18 2497.11 2503.28 s0001 SO YOU GET A GUY WITH A HIGH COST OF PREPARING AN INFINITE CLUSTER P. PAYING HE'S GOING LIKE IS TOTALLY UNAWARE 
VL-yalgea18 2503.29 2506.57 s0001 A GUY WAS ZERO COST OF THINGS GO LOOK LIKE A STORE WILL WORK 
VL-yalgea18 2506.57 2511.45 s0001 OKAY SO YOU CAN RADIATIONS OF ARE ALL OF OUR RATIONALITY 
VL-yalgea18 2511.46 2514.06 s0001 AND YOU HAVE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS SO YOU CAN HAVE 
VL-yalgea18 2514.07 2516.04 s0001 COST OF PREPARING 
VL-yalgea18 2517.23 2518.62 s0001 AND YOU CAN HAVE 
VL-yalgea18 2518.63 2523.71 s0001 ALERTNESS WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME YOU'RE ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION THAT MONTHS 
VL-yalgea18 2523.71 2526.69 s0001 WHAT FRACTION OF THE MONTHS TO ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION 
VL-yalgea18 2526.71 2528.81 s0001 AND YOU HAVE A DISTRIBUTION OF PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea18 2528.82 2532.03 s0001 DIFFERENT COST AND DIFFERENT ALERTNESS AS OKAY SO 
VL-yalgea18 2532.21 2533.16 s0001 THAT'S THE 
VL-yalgea18 2533.17 2535.69 s0016 MODEL THAT I BUILT THAT THIS IS SIMPLE FLIGHT CREW 
VL-yalgea18 2535.69 2537.53 s0001 THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA UM 
VL-yalgea18 2537.54 2538.98 s0001 OKAY EIGHT SOUL 
VL-yalgea18 2538.98 2540.06 s0001 AH 
VL-yalgea18 2540.06 2546.65 s0001 HERE'S THIS BURNED OUT THE FACT THAT I SHOW THAT IF YOU TAKE THE SAME COUPONS FOR OLDER ONE DRAMA 
VL-yalgea18 2546.65 2552.94 s0001 UP ON ALL THE WOMAN'S BURNED OUT WILL ALWAYS PREPAID SLOWER SO THE PINK ONE IS ALWAYS LESS THAN THE BLUE ONE BECAUSE IT 
VL-yalgea18 2552.94 2555.58 s0001 IT WENT THROUGH AN OPPORTUNITY PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 2555.59 2559.90 s0001 OKAY SO HERE YOU START WITH A POOL OF GUYS ON THE RIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 2559.94 2567.71 s0001 OKAY ON THE RIGHT AND THEN AFTER A WHILE AFTER TIME HAS GONE DOWN A LOT OF THEM ARE PREPAID AND YOU GET THE SO HERE'S ALERTNESS AND COST 
VL-yalgea18 2567.71 2569.56 s0001 YOU KNOW BUT AFTER TIME 
VL-yalgea18 2569.57 2571.96 s0001 SO YOU DESCRIBE A PERSON BY 
VL-yalgea18 2571.96 2578.87 s0001 WHAT IS COST OF REPAYING IS AND HOW ALERT E. AS THE MORAL EARLY YEARS OF THE LOWER THE COST OF REPAYING THE CLOSER RATIONALLY AS WELL 
VL-yalgea18 2578.88 2583.19 s0001 LESS ALERT E. IS THE HIGHER THE COST OF REPAYING THE CLOSER TO THE BOTH TOTALLY 
VL-yalgea18 2583.19 2584.49 s0001 DUMBED IDEAS 
VL-yalgea18 2584.48 2591.85 s0001 AND SO YOU CAN HAVE A YOU KNOW A WHOLE NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED DISTRIBUTION OF PEOPLE IN OVERTIME THOSE GROUPS ARE GOING TO 
VL-yalgea18 2591.86 2596.73 s0001 A BEING REDUCED BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE PREPPING BUT THERE WILL BE REDUCED SYMMETRIC LEE 
VL-yalgea18 2596.73 2598.10 s0001 THE LOW COST 
VL-yalgea18 2598.11 2601.86 s0001 HI ALERTNESS GUYS ARE GOING TO DISAPPEAR MUCH FASTER THE POOLS GOING TO GET 
VL-yalgea18 2601.87 2603.69 s0001 MORE MORE FAVOURABLE TO YOU 
VL-yalgea18 2603.69 2605.12 s0001 OKAY AND SO 
VL-yalgea18 2605.13 2608.83 s0001 ANYWAY ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PARAMETERIZE 
VL-yalgea18 2609.17 2613.59 s0001 BUT THE COST YOU KNOW WHAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF PEOPLE THE POPULATION WHAT THE 
VL-yalgea18 2613.59 2622.22 s0001 STANDARD DEVIATION AND THE EXPECTATION OF COST ISN'T OF ALERTNESS ISN'T THAT TELLS YOU WHAT THIS DISTRIBUTION LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE FITTING FOR NUMBERS AND YOU'VE GOT 
VL-yalgea18 2622.23 2625.64 s0001 THOUSANDS OF POOLS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF MONTHS AND 
VL-yalgea18 2625.65 2627.95 s0001 FITTING FOR PARAMETERS YOU CAN END UP 
VL-yalgea18 2627.95 2629.10 s0001 AH 
VL-yalgea18 2629.11 2632.00 s0001 SITTING ALL THE DATA SO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2632.01 2633.84 s0001 SO HERE'S THE SAME DATA 
VL-yalgea18 2633.85 2635.40 s0001 SO I JUST TELL YOU 
VL-yalgea18 2635.41 2639.07 s0001 YOU KNOW I KNOW ALL THAT IN THE POPULATION GIVEN WHAT I'VE 
VL-yalgea18 2639.08 2640.45 s0001 CALCULATED IN THAT 
VL-yalgea18 2640.46 2641.60 s0001 NINETIES THERE 
VL-yalgea18 2641.61 2647.87 s0001 I KNOW WHAT FRACTION OF THE PEOPLE HAVE THIS COST AN AT ALERTNESS WHAT FRACTION OF THE PEOPLE ARE SO CLOSE TO 
VL-yalgea18 2647.87 2652.31 s0001 YOU KNOW DUMB THAT THEIR COSTS ARE ASTRONOMICAL ALERTNESS IS TINY WHAT 
VL-yalgea18 2652.32 2655.10 s0001 WHAT FRACTION OF PEOPLE HAVE ALMOST NO COST AND 
VL-yalgea18 2655.10 2661.98 s0001 IN A VERY HIGH ALERTNESS YOU KNOW I'M ONLY ESTIMATING FOR PRAM OR SOME ASSUMING IS NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED GIVING THAT FIXED POOL 
VL-yalgea18 2661.99 2666.08 s0001 I HAD OF PEOPLE I APPLIED AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY SINGLE MORTGAGE 
VL-yalgea18 2666.09 2668.63 s0001 I JUST CRANK OUT WHAT WHAT THOSE GUYS DO 
VL-yalgea18 2668.63 2671.52 s0001 YOU KNOW IN THE TREE IF THEY KNEW WHAT THE VOLATILITY IS WORK 
VL-yalgea18 2671.53 2673.58 s0001 WHEN WHEN THEY DECIDE TO PREPAID 
VL-yalgea18 2673.59 2676.60 s0001 AND THEN I HAVE TO FOLLOW SCENARIO OUT THE FUTURE 
VL-yalgea18 2676.61 2678.51 s0001 AND I SAY WELL ALONG THIS PATH 
VL-yalgea18 2678.51 2683.57 s0001 WHICH GUY WOULD PREPAID WHICH THERE WOULDN'T BE PAVED WHAT WITH THE TOTAL THREE THINGS LOOK ALONG THAT PATH 
VL-yalgea18 2683.58 2693.52 s0001 AND SO THIS IS GENERATED THE PINK LINE FROM A MODEL WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD EXCEPT THEY FIT THOSE PARAMETERS THEY LOOK HOW CLOSE IT IS TO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED SO IT TURNS OUT 
VL-yalgea18 2693.52 2695.43 s0001 THAT WAS INCREDIBLY EASY 
VL-yalgea18 2695.44 2696.48 s0001 TO PREDICT 
VL-yalgea18 2696.49 2698.41 s0001 A CONTINGENT WE PREDICT 
VL-yalgea18 2698.42 2700.21 s0001 WHAT PREPAYMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE 
VL-yalgea18 2700.22 2702.98 s0001 AND THEREFORE TO BE ABLE TO VALUE MORTGAGES 
VL-yalgea18 2702.98 2709.08 s0001 OKAY AND THIS WAS A SECRET THAT NOT MANY PEOPLE YELL BUNCH OF PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT NOT THAT MANY UNDERSTOOD AND SO FOR YEARS 
VL-yalgea18 2709.09 2712.26 s0001 WE'RE TRADING OUR HEDGE WANNA FIRST A KINDER THAN ELLINGTON 
VL-yalgea18 2712.27 2715.76 s0001 WITH THIS ABILITY TO HAVE TO CONTINUALLY FORECAST 
VL-yalgea18 2715.77 2718.01 s0001 PREPAYMENT SET A VERY HIGH RATE 
VL-yalgea18 2718.02 2719.73 s0001 AND WHY WAS IT SO 
VL-yalgea18 2719.74 2723.89 s0001 STABLE THE PREDICTION AND SO RELIABLE IT'S BECAUSE THE CLASS OF PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea18 2723.90 2731.44 s0001 STAY PRETTY MUCH THE SAME IN EVERY YEAR THERE BE THE SAME KINDS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME KINDS OF BEHAVIOUR SOMEWHERE VERY WORD SOMEWHERE VERY NOT ALERT 
VL-yalgea18 2731.45 2734.23 s0001 BUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF TYPES IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME 
VL-yalgea18 2734.24 2736.70 s0001 AND YOU COULD PREDICT WITH PRETTY GOOD ACCURACY 
VL-yalgea18 2736.71 2738.57 s0001 WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FROM YEAR TO YEAR 
VL-yalgea18 2738.58 2740.12 s0001 OF COURSE THEN 
VL-yalgea18 2740.13 2742.07 s0001 IN AFTER TWO THOUSAND 
VL-yalgea18 2742.08 2743.12 s0001 THREE YEARS OLD 
VL-yalgea18 2743.13 2745.83 s0001 THE CLASS OF PEOPLE START TO RADICALLY CHANGE 
VL-yalgea18 2745.84 2751.78 s0001 AND MANY MORE PEOPLE NEVER GOT MORTGAGES BEFORE DOCUMENT BECAME MUCH HARDER FOR TO TO PREDICT WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO 
VL-yalgea18 2751.78 2755.85 s0001 BUT SO IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS PRETTY EASY TO PREDICT AND WHY WAS IT SO EASY TO PREDICT 
VL-yalgea18 2755.86 2758.46 s0001 BECAUSE WAS AN AGENT BASED MODEL 
VL-yalgea18 2761.19 2765.68 s0001 OKAY AGENT THEY SO BY THE WAY I ADDED THIS VOLATILITY HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2765.69 2772.09 s0001 SO THESE GUYS ARE JUST WHERE AGGRESSION THEY HAD TO HAVE A VOLATILITY OR SOMETHING PRAM OR C. C. IS VOLATILITY GOES UP 
VL-yalgea18 2772.09 2773.91 s0001 THE PREPAYMENT SO SLOW OR 
VL-yalgea18 2773.92 2775.04 s0001 WELL 
VL-yalgea18 2775.04 2780.54 s0001 THEY JUST HAD TO NOTICE THAT AND BUILD A RIGHT INTO THEIR FUNCTIONALITY WE HAVE TO THINK OF THAT OR BURNOUT 
VL-yalgea18 2780.55 2782.57 s0001 NONE OF THOSE THINGS I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 
VL-yalgea18 2782.58 2784.89 s0001 BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A GUY OPTIMISE IN HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2784.90 2790.04 s0001 AND VOLATILITY GOES UP SO YOU WE SET THE TREES SO THAT THE INTEREST RATES CAN CHANGE FASTER 
VL-yalgea18 2790.05 2799.18 s0001 THE OPTION IS WORTH MORE SURE NOW WAIT LONGER YOU'RE NOT JUST EXERCISE RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE TO ANOTHER PRICES ARE REALLY GO UP C. CAN WAIT A LITTLE LONGER AFFORD TO WAIT LONGER 
VL-yalgea18 2799.19 2801.11 s0001 SO PREPAYMENT SO SLOW DOWN 
VL-yalgea18 2801.12 2805.46 s0001 OKAY SO I'M SAYING ALL THIS IS JUST TO SAY THAT IN THE RIGHT SO IT'S AGENT BASED 
VL-yalgea18 2805.47 2808.30 s0001 IT'S A CONTINGENT PREDICTIONS 
VL-yalgea18 2808.71 2810.96 s0001 CONTINGENT PREDICTIONS 
VL-yalgea18 2810.96 2814.87 s0001 INVOLVES TWO THINGS TOGETHER ENABLE YOU TO MAKE 
VL-yalgea18 2814.88 2819.50 s0001 QUITE RELIABLE PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE IF YOU'RE IN A STABLE ENVIRONMENT 
VL-yalgea18 2819.51 2824.02 s0001 AND AH SO WHAT SEEMS LIKE A BEWILDERING A LOT OF STUFF TURNS OUT 
VL-yalgea18 2824.02 2826.27 s0001 TO BE PRETTY EASY TO EXPLAIN 
VL-yalgea18 2826.28 2829.03 s0001 OKAY SO NOW WHAT HAPPENS 
VL-yalgea18 2830.05 2833.13 s0001 IT'S THE ONLY QUESTIONS HERE OR SHOULD I 
VL-yalgea18 2833.63 2835.37 s0001 YES 
VL-yalgea18 2842.39 2844.12 s0001 SOME SORT OF WHAT 
VL-yalgea18 2844.45 2849.16 s0001 I HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE MEANING OF ARYAN SAYS SO HOW DO I KNOW SO THERE'S THERE'S 
VL-yalgea18 2849.17 2852.80 s0001 I MEAN AND VARIANCE OF COST AND MEAN AND VARIANCE OF ALERTNESS TO GET THAT 
VL-yalgea18 2852.80 2854.10 s0001 DISTRIBUTION RIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 2854.11 2857.96 s0001 SO HOW DO I KNOW WHAT THE POPULATION SO LET ME JUST PUT THE PICTURE UP AGAIN 
VL-yalgea18 2857.97 2859.37 s0001 UM 
VL-yalgea18 2860.58 2862.32 s0001 OKAY HERE 
VL-yalgea18 2862.58 2871.02 s0001 SO GIVEN SO FOR THE HYPER RATIONAL DIES OF THE PEOPLE TO REALLY HIGH ALERTNESS UP THERE IN THE REALLY LOW COST A LITTLE GUYS BACK THERE 
VL-yalgea18 2871.02 2872.86 s0001 THERE WE ARE 
VL-yalgea18 2874.40 2877.12 s0001 OKAY THERE'S A HYPER ARM 
VL-yalgea18 2877.13 2883.65 s0001 FOR ME WAS THE GUY'S NOT ONE OF THESE CORNERS WITH VERY HIGH ALERTNESS AND VERY LOW COST I FORGOT WHICH WAY THE SCALE WORKS 
VL-yalgea18 2883.65 2888.39 s0001 ARE THEY MIGHT BE GOING DOWN SO ANYWAY THE GUYS ARE VERY HIGH ALERTNESS AND VERY LOW COST 
VL-yalgea18 2888.40 2890.54 s0001 OR THE HYPER RATIONAL PEOPLE AT THE OTHER 
VL-yalgea18 2890.55 2897.87 s0001 CORNER YOU'VE GOT THE GUYS WHO ARE VERY LOW ALERTNESS AND VERY HIGH COST THEY'RE THE PEOPLE HERE TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ON A FEW THE BANK 
VL-yalgea18 2897.88 2898.93 s0001 SO 
VL-yalgea18 2898.94 2901.55 s0001 HOW DO I KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REACH TYPE 
VL-yalgea18 2901.56 2905.89 s0001 WELL I DON'T I HAVE TO I HAVE TO DO YOU KNOW FIT THIS DISTRIBUTION 
VL-yalgea18 2905.90 2909.67 s0001 BUT YOU SEE I HAVE SO MUCH DATA I'VE GOT THIS KIND OF CURVE 
VL-yalgea18 2909.68 2911.69 s0001 THIS KIND OF CURVE I'VE GOT 
VL-yalgea18 2911.70 2913.60 s0001 FOR EVERY STARTING YEAR 
VL-yalgea18 2913.61 2919.50 s0001 YOU KNOW FOR THE WHOLE HISTORY AND THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT INTEREST RATES AND SO MANY DIFFERENT CELL 
VL-yalgea18 2919.51 2923.91 s0001 YEAH I'M APPLYING THAT SAME POPULATION AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY SINGLE CURVE 
VL-yalgea18 2923.92 2925.65 s0001 AND THEN SEEING WHAT HAPPENS 
VL-yalgea18 2925.66 2927.97 s0001 SO MY PREDICTION VERSES WHAT REALLY HAPPENED 
VL-yalgea18 2927.98 2929.75 s0001 AND SO I CAN ALWAYS SO 
VL-yalgea18 2929.76 2940.06 s0001 I'VE GOT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DATA POINTS ARE ONLY FOUR PARAMETERS TO FIT SO I PICKED THE FOUR PARAMETERS TO FIT THE DATA AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IF I ASSUMED EVERYBODY WAS PERFECTLY ALERT 
VL-yalgea18 2940.07 2946.29 s0001 NOPE INSTEAD OF THAT CURVE THAT I SHOWED YOU I PUT A HUGE CROWD HERE OF PERFECTLY RATIONAL PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea18 2946.30 2947.83 s0001 THEN I WOULD HAVE FOUND 
VL-yalgea18 2947.83 2952.10 s0001 THAT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN PREPAYMENT ZERO AND A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THEIR 
VL-yalgea18 2952.11 2956.13 s0001 ZERO ALL THE WAY OVER HERE AND SO WOULD AFFECT THAT CURVE 
VL-yalgea18 2956.13 2960.24 s0001 SO THAT'S HOW I KNEW THAT THEY COULDN'T BE THAT MANY PERFECTLY RATIONAL PEOPLE 
VL-yalgea18 2960.93 2962.66 s0001 OKAY YES 
VL-yalgea18 2965.66 2970.62 s0001 DOING HOW DO I KNOW COST NO ALERTNESS MAYBE THERE'S SOME OTHER FACTORS YES WELL 
VL-yalgea18 2970.62 2973.08 s0001 OKAY THERE PROBABLY ARE OTHER FACTORS SO 
VL-yalgea18 2973.10 2980.93 s0001 I WAS SO WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU COMMON SENSE OF WE THINK ARE THE FACTORS WHAT KEEPS PEOPLE FROM CREEPING I THINK THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE IS A HUGE HASSLE 
VL-yalgea18 2980.94 2982.45 s0001 AND THEN A PAYING ATTENTION 
VL-yalgea18 2982.46 2985.40 s0001 SO WAS THE FIRST TWO I THOUGHT YOU THINK OF ANOTHER ONE 
VL-yalgea18 2986.04 2988.41 s0001 THEIR AGE OKAY EXACTLY 
VL-yalgea18 2988.41 2991.58 s0001 SO MAYBE THEY'RE SO MAYBE DEMOGRAPHY HAS AN EFFECT ON IT 
VL-yalgea18 2991.59 2996.21 s0001 OKAY SO MAYBE FOR EXAMPLE YOU GET MORE SOPHISTICATED THE OLDER YOU GET 
VL-yalgea18 2996.21 2998.40 s0001 SO OKAY THAT WAS ANOTHER FACTOR WE PUT OR 
VL-yalgea18 2998.40 3002.78 s0001 SO I'M NOT TELL YOU ALL THE FACTORS BUT THESE WERE THE TWO BOMBING 
VL-yalgea18 3002.80 3005.32 s0001 THESE ARE THE TWO MAIN FACTORS OKAY 
VL-yalgea18 3005.33 3007.98 s0001 ANOTHER FACTOR WAS GROWING SOPHISTICATION 
VL-yalgea18 3007.99 3009.93 s0001 WE CALL THAT THE SMART FACTOR 
VL-yalgea18 3009.94 3011.35 s0001 THERE 
VL-yalgea18 3011.35 3013.89 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S ANOTHER FACTOR 
VL-yalgea18 3013.89 3015.60 s0001 OKAY BUT BUT THEY ARE 
VL-yalgea18 3015.61 3017.89 s0001 SO OVER TIME YOU GET MORE SOPHISTICATED 
VL-yalgea18 3017.90 3019.88 s0001 SO UM 
VL-yalgea18 3020.05 3028.70 s0001 OKAY SO ANYWAY THE POINT IS WITH A FEW OF THESE FACTORS USED IN THAT A PRETTY GOOD THAT WAS PRETTY RELIABLE AND YOU COULD PREDICT WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN CONTINUALLY 
VL-yalgea18 3028.71 3032.72 s0001 OKAY AND SO NOW WHAT WAS SO NOW IF YOU WANT TO TRADE MORTGAGES 
VL-yalgea18 3032.72 3035.62 s0001 WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT HAPPEN 
VL-yalgea18 3035.64 3037.27 s0001 OKAY WELL 
VL-yalgea18 3038.80 3042.31 s0001 OKAY THE FIRST INTERESTING THING TO NOTICE IS THAT 
VL-yalgea18 3042.32 3043.48 s0001 ON 
VL-yalgea18 3043.49 3045.18 s0001 WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS 
VL-yalgea18 3045.20 3047.46 s0001 AS THE INTEREST RATE GOES DOWN 
VL-yalgea18 3047.47 3049.53 s0001 OKAY SO THE FIRST THING TO NOTICE 
VL-yalgea18 3049.54 3050.96 s0001 IS 
VL-yalgea18 3051.86 3054.87 s0001 ALRIGHT I'LL JUST MAKE TO A 
VL-yalgea18 3054.88 3056.27 s0001 AS YOU TOO 
VL-yalgea18 3056.28 3058.80 s0001 QUESTIONS THAT GO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF RUNNING ROOM 
VL-yalgea18 3058.80 3061.09 s0001 SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE THE 
VL-yalgea18 3061.10 3064.68 s0001 MORTGAGE VALUE AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GET IN THE TREE 
VL-yalgea18 3065.03 3067.74 s0001 RIGHT SO INDUSTRY THAT WE BUILT 
VL-yalgea18 3067.74 3069.35 s0001 YOU KNOW HERE'S THE TREE 
VL-yalgea18 3069.36 3071.03 s0001 IT'S GOING LIKE THAT 
VL-yalgea18 3071.03 3074.22 s0001 AND EVERY NOW OLD WERE PREDICTING YOU KNOW 
VL-yalgea18 3074.23 3079.40 s0001 FOR EACH CLASS OF PEOPLE WERE PREDICTING WHERE HIS ONES ARE SO THAT CLASS IS PRETTY PAYING 
VL-yalgea18 3079.41 3082.56 s0001 THE OTHER CLASSES NOT A SMART SLAVES THAT NUMBER NOT 
VL-yalgea18 3082.57 3086.62 s0001 CREEPING HERE BUT MAYBE ONE THINGS GET REALLY LOVE ALL STAR PREPPING HERE 
VL-yalgea18 3086.63 3095.45 s0001 SO EACH EACH CLASS OF PEOPLE EACH COST ALERTNESS TYPE HAS ITS OWN TREE THOUGH THE SAME TREE BUT ITS OWN BEHAVIOR ON THE TREE LIKE ADAM ALTOGETHER OKAY 
VL-yalgea18 3095.46 3096.50 s0001 SO 
VL-yalgea18 3096.51 3097.90 s0001 ON 
VL-yalgea18 3098.88 3100.55 s0001 WHAT HAPPENS 
VL-yalgea18 3100.56 3103.28 s0001 WITH THE STARTING INTEREST RATE 
VL-yalgea18 3106.31 3110.87 s0001 SO HERE WE HAD POINT ALL SEX AND THIS VALUE WAS YOU KNOW NINETY EIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 3110.88 3112.10 s0001 OR SOMETHING 
VL-yalgea18 3112.11 3115.62 s0001 RIGHT NOW SUPPOSE THE INTEREST RATE WENT DOWN TO POINT FIVE 
VL-yalgea18 3115.62 3118.51 s0001 I DO THIS PICTURE OF INTEREST 
VL-yalgea18 3119.20 3121.53 s0001 AND MORTGAGE VALUE 
VL-yalgea18 3122.68 3127.01 s0001 WHEN YOU THINK HAPPENS THE INTEREST STARTS THIS IS YOU KNOW NINETY EIGHT 
VL-yalgea18 3127.02 3132.57 s0001 SIX PERCENT IS THERE IS THE INTEREST RATE GOES DOWN WHAT YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THE VALUE OF THE MORTGAGE 
VL-yalgea18 3134.60 3136.25 s0001 IF YOUR BANK 
VL-yalgea18 3136.26 3137.53 s0001 AND YOU 
VL-yalgea18 3137.54 3140.68 s0001 SEXTON THE MORTGAGE RATE IS EIGHT PERCENT 
VL-yalgea18 3140.68 3142.78 s0001 AND THAT'S A FIXED MORTGAGE RATE 
VL-yalgea18 3142.78 3149.95 s0001 BUT NOW YOU'VE MOVED ON THE TRAIN FROM HERE TO HERE USING YOUR MORTGAGE IS GOING TO GO UP IN VALUE OR DOWN IN VALUE 
VL-yalgea18 3156.94 3162.20 s0001 IT'S GOING TO GO UP BECAUSE THE INTEREST RATES ARE LOWER IN THE PRESENT VALUE THE PAYMENTS IS GETTING HIGHER 
VL-yalgea18 3162.20 3166.45 s0001 OKAY SO THE INTEREST RATE GOES DOWN THE MORTGAGES GOING TO GO UP LIKE THAT 
VL-yalgea18 3166.45 3167.85 s0001 TYPICALLY 
VL-yalgea18 3167.85 3176.27 s0001 OKAY BUT WILL I KEEP GOING UP LIKE THIS IN THIS AURORA BOND IT WOULD GO UP LIKE THAT QUITE A BOND THE A ONE YEAR BOND WHICH OH ONE ONE PLUS R. 
VL-yalgea18 3176.28 3178.24 s0001 YOU KNOW WE KEEP GOING UP THE TOP 
VL-yalgea18 3178.25 3181.51 s0001 THE VALUE FOR GOT NEGATIVE SAY WOULD GO UP BUT YOU KNOW 
VL-yalgea18 3181.52 3185.14 s0001 AS OUR GOT NEGATIVE WOULD NO WAY OF LIKE THAT 
VL-yalgea18 3185.78 3188.88 s0001 SO DOES THE MORTGAGE KEEP GOING UP LIKE THAT 
VL-yalgea18 3188.88 3190.74 s0001 AS THE INDUSTRY GOES DOWN 
VL-yalgea18 3190.75 3195.04 s0001 IS THE VALUE THE MORE IS GOING TO GET HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER 
VL-yalgea18 3197.37 3201.79 s0001 SUPPOSE THE GUYS OPTIMAL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS IS A HUNDRED HERE 
VL-yalgea18 3203.05 3204.84 s0001 WHAT'LL HAPPEN 
VL-yalgea18 3205.97 3207.35 s0001 YUP 
VL-yalgea18 3207.37 3208.52 s0001 IT 
VL-yalgea18 3208.53 3215.99 s0001 IS GOING TO EVENTUALLY FIGURE OUT THAT HE SHOULD PREPARE A MIKE IN ALL SOBEL LIKE RECIPES PERFECTLY OPTIMAL HAVE NEVER LET IT GO ABOVE A HUNDRED 
VL-yalgea18 3215.99 3219.25 s0001 SO IS GOING TO GO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS THE INTEREST RATE GETS HIGHER 
VL-yalgea18 3219.26 3220.57 s0001 YOU GET CRUSHED 
VL-yalgea18 3220.58 3225.04 s0001 AND AS THE INDUSTRY GET SLOWER YOU DON'T GET THE FULL UPSIDE BECAUSE HE'S PREPPING 
VL-yalgea18 3225.05 3228.15 s0001 YOU KNOW AT A HUNDRED IS NEVER LETTING IT GO ABOVE A HUNDRED 
VL-yalgea18 3231.13 3237.60 s0001 RIGHT SO HE'S NOT SO OPTIMAL MAYBE YOUR VALUE WILL GO OFF BUT NOT YOU KNOW NOT SO ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH 
VL-yalgea18 3237.61 3244.38 s0001 SO THIS IDEA THAT THE MORTGAGE CURVE INSTEAD OF BEING LIKE THIS GOES LIKE THAT THIS IS WHAT WAS CALLED NEGATIVE COMPLEXITY 
VL-yalgea18 3246.93 3249.72 s0001 OKAY NOW THE NEXT THING 
VL-yalgea18 3249.73 3251.36 s0001 THE NEXT THING TO KNOW 
VL-yalgea18 3251.36 3253.47 s0001 IS SUPPOSE 
VL-yalgea18 3253.47 3254.93 s0001 THAT'S 
VL-yalgea18 3254.94 3257.96 s0001 ARM SUPPOSE THAT THE THING IS 
VL-yalgea18 3257.96 3262.00 s0001 THE GUYS ARE PARTLY IRRATIONAL SO IT'S GOING ABOVE A HUNDRED 
VL-yalgea18 3262.14 3264.89 s0001 OKAY SO IT STARTED TO GO LIKE THIS 
VL-yalgea18 3264.89 3266.26 s0001 THAN WHAT YOU THINK 
VL-yalgea18 3266.27 3269.62 s0001 THE INDUSTRY GETS REALLY LAW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
VL-yalgea18 3272.69 3274.57 s0001 I JUST SAT AT SO 
VL-yalgea18 3274.58 3279.79 s0001 IF THE GUY WAS RATIONAL PERFECTLY RATIONAL WOULD GO LIKE THAT HE NEVER LET IT GO ABOVE A HUNDRED 
VL-yalgea18 3279.79 3282.99 s0001 BUT NOW SUPPOSE GUYS ARE NOT TOTALLY RATIONAL 
VL-yalgea18 3283.00 3284.52 s0001 WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS 
VL-yalgea18 3284.53 3292.94 s0001 THEY'RE GOING TO SORT OF AS RATES GET A LITTLE BIT LULLED OR NOT THERE ARE OVERLOOKED THE FACT MISSION CREEP A ZONE OUT ADVANTAGEOUS DO THINGS ARE WORTH MORE THAN A HUNDRED 
VL-yalgea18 3292.95 3296.81 s0001 BUT IF RATES GET INCREDIBLY LOW EVEN THE DUMBEST GUY THE LEAST 
VL-yalgea18 3296.82 3299.18 s0001 THE LEAST THE HIGHEST COST DIED 
VL-yalgea18 3299.19 3301.88 s0001 IS THERE REALISE USE AN ADVANCED DEGREE PAY 
VL-yalgea18 3301.89 3304.37 s0001 AND SOME THINGS ARE GOING TO GO BACK DOWN LIKE THAT 
VL-yalgea18 3304.38 3309.19 s0001 SO THE VALUES GOING TO BE QUITE COMPLICATED SO THIS IS THE MORTGAGE VALUE 
VL-yalgea18 3309.20 3312.82 s0001 AS A FUNCTION OF INTEREST RATES JUST COMMON SENSE WILL TELL YOU THIS THAT 
VL-yalgea18 3312.83 3317.92 s0001 OKAY IN A IN A TYPICAL BOND IS THE INTEREST RATE GETS LOWER THE PRESENT VALUE GETS HIGHER 
VL-yalgea18 3317.93 3323.43 s0001 YOU SHOULD EXPECT THE CURVE LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF THE OPTION FOR RATIONALLY AND EXERCISE 
VL-yalgea18 3323.44 3326.63 s0001 THE CURVE WOULD NEVER GET ABOVE A HUNDRED TO HAVE TO GO LIKE THAT
