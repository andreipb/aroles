our hedge funds 

can we put something else aside that you view at a percentage 

rate that you think you can trust and then you can trust the 

rest of it to whatever the real probabilities are 

well you can bet with another  

at  to  odds 

if the yankees win the first game youre just doing great 

if the yankees lose the first game youre looking to be in a 

little bit of trouble 

so the point is youre not going to get the payoffs until 

the very end either plus  or minus  

but already by the first game youre either doing better than 

you were before or worse than you were before 


youre already in effect suffering some risk 

at the very beginning 

so this is one of the great ideas of finance 

you shouldnt hedge the final outcome 

you should hedge next days outcome 

if youre marking to market thats what youd have to do 

marking to market youd have to say my position nowmy bet is 

worth  dollars 

the yankees lost the first game the bet would be worth  

dollars 

so what does it mean to protect yourself 

not just protect yourself against whats happening at the 


end thats really what you want to 

do but in order to do that you should protect yourself every 

day against what could happen 

so every day you should end up with  here and  there 

because after all thats what youre trying to 

lock in 

no matter who wins the first game you should still say im  

dollars ahead because i got myself in this position 

so how could you do that 

well lets bet at  to  odds right  is  to  odds 

lets make a bet with another bookie at  and  here 

so i put it in the wrong place 

this is the  and this is  but plus  and minus  

so what are you doing here 


notice that this is  times  this is  times  

this is  odds 

im betting on the phillies 

if the phillies win one game i collect  dollars 

thats what i should do that he said 

he said go to the bookie across the street and bet on one 

game not the whole series 

bet on one game with that bookie across the street 

 dollars versus  dollars 

lets say you can only bet  game at a time with the other 

bookies actually maybe you were saying 

all along bet on the whole series 

but lets say you can only bet one game at a time with the 


other bookies 

youd bet  dollars on the phillies in the first game 

that naive philly fan has put up  dollars on the series 

youre in the first game going to put  dollars 

youve taken his bet so youre hoping the yankees win 

but thats bad to be in a position where you have to hope 

you dont want to do that 

so you take his bet on the phillies because hes given you 

 to  odds 

thats even odds even though you know the yankees have a  

percent change of winning 

you go to the bookie across the street and you bet at  odds 

on the phillies but you dont bet the whole 

 

you only bet  dollars of it 

so if you win you get  dollars 

if you lose you only have to pay the guy  

so whats going to happen 

after the first day this position is going to be worth  

and this position is also going to be worth  

exactly where you started 

so because a win in the first game is going to put you so far 

ahead in your bet with the first naive philly better 


and a loss in the first game is going to put you so far behind 

you hedge that possibility by going  in favor of the 

phillies 

you take a big bet on the yankees and then you make a 

smaller bet on the phillies that cancels out part of the big bet 

on the yankees but youve made the two at 

different odds and so on net youre still going to be  

dollars ahead 

lets just pause for a second and see if you got that 

so by doing this you cant possibly lose any money 


and now youre going to repeat this bet down here and here 

so in the nextyou see where do things go next 

here youre down  dollars 

if you lost again youd be down  dollars 

now things would really be bad 

after the yankees lost two games in a row your original bet 

would look terrible but things arent so bad 

because you bet on the phillies here 

you already made  dollars 

so how much money do you think you should be betting on the 

phillies down here 

well you want to lock in  dollars at every node no matter 

what happens 

this  dollars by making the right offsetting 

bet you can keep  everywhere here until the very end 

and so no matter what happened you can always end up with  

dollars 

thats the essence of hedging 


so lets just say it again what the idea is 

its a great idea and we dont have time to go through all the 

details but the great idea is this 

youve made some gigantic bet with somebody 

why do you bet with anybody 

because you think you know more than they do 

the whole essence of trading and finance is you think you 

understand the world better than somebody else 

so understand it means you think somethings going to turn 


out one way that the other guy doesnt really know is going to 

happen 

so youre making a bet on whether youre right or wrong 

so when you say you know you dont know for sure 

you just have a better idea than he does 

so you want to use your idea without running the risk 

so how can you do it 

if your idea is really correct there may be a way so that you 

can eliminate the luck
