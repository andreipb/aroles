in the entire year right they have  chances 

during the year 

it takes them an entire year and only  percent of them have 

figured out that they should prepay 

so you know theyre not acting optimally 

so just from that graph that would tell you 

and you have further evidence of that 

thats evidence that they arent acting optimally 

furthermore you have evidence that the banks dont expect them 

to be acting optimally because the banks arent charging them  

or  percent interest which is what they would need 

to pay to get the thing worth  

theyre charging them  and  half percent interest which for 

the optimal prepayer is worth much less than  to the bank 

so the banks wouldnt do that 

they would just go out of business if they did something 

stupid like that 

they wouldnt do that unless they thought that the homeowners 

werent acting at least not all of them 

acting optimally 

so suppose you had to predict how people are going to act in 

the future and you wanted to trade on that 

what would you do 

how would you think about predicting it 

so this is the data that you have 

what would you do 

you have this data 

these are  percent things 

you also have  percent mortgages issued the year 

before and then maybe a year before 

that there were  and  half percent interest and you have 

that history and youve got all these 

different pools and all these different histories 

how would you think about figuring out a prepaymenthow 


would you predict prepayments 

well the way economists macro economists at least in 

the old days used to make predictions 

they would say hum the first quarter 

looks pretty good 

what are they predicting now 

now theyre saying unemployment is probably going 

to keep rising for the next quarter or two well until the 

next year but at that point things are 

going to turn around and we expect the economy to get 

stronger come out of its recession and 

unemployment should gradually improve from its high which we 


expect will be  and  half percent to something back down 

to  percent by the end of  

thats more or less the economists prediction 

now can you make a prediction like that about prepayments 

would it make sense to make a prediction about that 

why is that an utterly stupid kind of prediction 

what is the essence of good prediction 

if you wanted to predict something and you were going to 

lose a lot of money if your prediction was wrong how would 

you refine your prediction compared to what i just gave as 

a sample prediction 

yep 

you have to have a number of scenarios  

 

to each one 

exactly  

so what he said is if youre even the slightest bit 

sophisticated youre not going to make a bald noncontingent 

prediction 

things are going to get worse the next two quarters 

then theyre going to start getting better 

then things are going to get as well as theyre going to get 

after two years 

youll solve the problem after two years 

what happens if another war breaks out in iraq 


what if iran bombs israel 

what if theres another crash in commercial real estate 

how could that prediction possibly turn out to be true 

its a sure thing its going to be wrong 

its just impossible thats going to be right because the 

guy making the prediction has made no contingencies built in 

his prediction 

you know that guys making a prediction for free 

someone may be paying him to hear him but hes not going to 

be penalized if his prediction is wrong 

no one in their right mind would make such a prediction 

so the first thing you should do in predicting prepayments is 


to realize that youve got a tree of possible futures 

and given this tree of possible futures youre going to predict 

different prepayments depending on where you go on the tree 

so you see prediction is not a simple one eventits not a one 

shot thing 

just as he so aptly put it its a many scenario thing 

you have to predict on many many scenarios what you think 

will happen and that makes your prediction much better because 

of course if there is a war in iraq 


and if there is a catastrophe in afghanistan 

and if iran does bomb israel and if the commercial real 

estate market collapses things are going to be a lot worse than 

this original guys prediction 

so everybody knows that so why not make the prediction 

more sensible 

so on wall street thats what everybodys done for  years 

now they havent done it for  years 

its just  years that theyve been doing that 

so when i got to kidder peabody in  they were making these 


one scenario predictions 

its a long story which ill tell maybe sunday night 

i ended up in charge of the research department and so we 

made you know other firms were doing this 

already we made scenario predictions okay 

so now what kind of scenario predictions are you going to 

make 

when you make contingent predictions there are an awful 

lot of them 

you cant even write them all down so what you have to do is 

you have to have a model 

so what kind of model should you have 

ill tell you now what the standard guys were doing on wall 


street at the time 

they were sayingheres interest rate 

sorry 

heres the present value of a mortgage 

heres the present value of a callable mortgage 

present value of  dollar of principal so realistic 

prepayments 

so if we go over here well see that people said 

look from this graph its clear 

they would say that when interest rates 

went down people prepay more so why dont we have a function 


that looks like this 

so prepay thats the percentage of remaining balance 

that is paid off 

so what does that mean 

remember after youve made your coupon payment you have a 

remaining balance b 

you could pay all of it or none of it 

or half of it 

so the prepay is what percentage of the 

bthats just after youve paid right 

so b lets do that one 

b just after youve paid  the 

remaining balance has now been reduced to b 

you could in addition to the  pay off all of that 

b 

typically some people who are alert and think its a good time 

to prepay will pay all of b 


others will pay none of b 

so if you aggregate over the whole collection of people the 

prepay percentages out of the sums of all their 

bs what percentage of them are going to pay off 

so we look at the aggregate prepayment 

thats the old fashioned way 

and we say what percentage of the remaining 

balance is paid off 

so youd make a function like this 

youd say well prepaid might equal  

percent 

why am i picking  percent 

so if you go back to this picture you see that prepayments
