Description
This lecture reviews the intuition from the previous class, where the 
idea of dynamic hedging was introduced. We learn why the crucial idea of 
dynamic hedging is marking to market: even when there are millions of possible 
scenarios that could come to pass over time, by hedging a little bit each step 
of the way, the number of possibilities becomes much more manageable. We conclude 
the discussion of hedging by introducing a measure for the average life of a bond, 
and show how traders use this to figure out the appropriate hedge against 
interest rate movements.
