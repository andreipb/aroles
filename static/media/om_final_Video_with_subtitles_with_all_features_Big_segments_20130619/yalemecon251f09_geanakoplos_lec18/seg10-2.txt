so ws is going to be what 

its going to be the minimum of  you could just pay it if you 

wanted to or you could wait 

 over  rs and then what would you have to 

do you would have to make your payment 

well whats your payment 

the payment is this  but divided by b plus 

the remaining balance of  dollar 

so b over b times the 

remainder times wsup 

now why is this right 

i hope it is right by the way 

i should have thought of this a little before 

so this is the remainder of  dollar left 

so if i divide by b here im not going to have a 

remaining balance of b 

im going to have a remaining balance of b over 

b 

so if i started with  dollar of remaining balance then i know 


that in the next period im going to have b over 

b dollars of remaining balance left 

it doesnt sound too convincing by the way 

well its right and that happens with 

probability  half 

and then with the other probability  half 

plus i make the payment but i go down instead of up and 

so i have b over b but i have 

wsdown and thats also times  half 

so either i pay off my remaining dollar or i end up 

with this many dollars 

assuming i had a  dollar of remaining balance im either 


going to pay it off the remaining balance 

or im going to have this much left next period and  dollar of 

remaining balance is going to be that 

so thats it 

so i know now by working this backwards i can tell what  

dollar at the beginning is worth 

and so its exactly the same calculation i did before except 

im talking about  dollar 

im always figuring out  dollar of remaining balance 

instead of the whole thing 


present value of callable so heres present value of  

dollar of principal 

and so remember the present value of a callable mortgage was 

 

here the present value of  dollar 

figuring it out that way is  obviously its divided 

by  but the key is that now you can 

see just by looking at it where the s are is where the guy 

decided to prepay 

so its the same thing as before but you see before you 

couldnt tell very easily from the numbers when i did the  

sorry that didnt quite make it 

before when i did the present value with the  all these 

numbers were s and s 


i mean where has he prepaid 

its hard to tell where the prepayment is 

if i do it all in terms of  dollar of remaining balance then 

just by looking at the screen i can tell where the guy prepaid 

because there are s there 

so i know where hes prepaid 

wherever the s are that means hes prepaid 

so i can tell very easily what he did 

all right thats the only purpose of doing the same 


calculation in a somewhat trickier way 

so if you think about it a second you see ive just divided 

byive always reduced things to if you had  dollar left 

all right so this tells us what to do when the guy should 

prepay and when he shouldnt prepay 

so if youre now in the world looking at whats happening you 

can find the historical record of how people have prepaid 

so lets just look at the historical record 


for example 

here if you can see this this is blown up as big as it 

goes 

so this is what you might see as the historical record of 

percentage prepayments annualized from  to  

say 

so you notice that theyre very low here and then they get to 

be very high and then they get low again 

and then they get high again 

so why do you think that happened 

so what is this 

this is prepayments for a particular mortgage 

 percent 

you take all the people in the country who started in  with 

 percent mortgages 

theres a huge crowd of those because that was about what the 

mortgage rate was that year 


so a huge collection of people got these mortgages in  and 

you keep track of what percentage of them prepaid 

really every month but you write the annualized 

rate and then this is the record 

so why do you think it changed so dramatically like that 

whats the explanation 

stock market  

what  

stock market  

it looks like the stock  

but i assure you the stock market had almost nothing to do 

with it 

why would prepayments be so low and then be so high 

then be low then be high 

what do you think was happening 

interest rate  

interest rate  

we just did that 

we just solved that 

that was the whole point of what we were doing 

so you tell me what do you think happened in 

 

this is september  

i dont know if you can read that 

what do you think was going on then 

interest rates got  

interest rates got low  

so you may not remember this because you were barely born 

in the early s there was a recession and then the 

government cut the interest rates 

in the s the early s there was a 

recession and the government kept cutting interest rates 

further and further and further 

there was this huge decline in interest rates through the early 

s and so what happened 

all these people who in  who had these  percent 

mortgagesthe new interest rates were lower and so they all 

prepaid 

you got this shocking amount of prepayment 

so this graph which seems sort of surprising 

and looks like the stock market turns out to have nothing to do 

with the stock market 

it has to do with where the interest rates are 

well do you think interest rates explain everything 

no 

what else could you notice about theescape 


what else have we learned here by doing these calculations 

well what weve learned so far is that if the interest rates in 

the economy are at  percent thats where they started 

remember we said they started at  percent and there was  

percent volatility 

here i had  percent volatility 

it doesnt matter 

i mean thats a plausible amount of volatility 

a little high but that volatility 

the mortgage rate of  percent is not going to give a value of 

 

its going to cheat the bank if the homeowners are acting 

rationally 

the bank could get  if the people werent acting 

rationally 

they were just never exercising their option 

it theyre exercising their option optimally the thing was 

only worth  

now i told you at that time the interest rates should have 

been around  and  half percent 

not  percent given this  percent interest rate in the 

economy 

the mortgage rate should be  and  half percent 

so we deduced last time that obviously not everybodys acting 

optimally 

well you can tell that looking at this diagram 

how do you know that not everybodys acting optimally 

remember these are  mortgages so everybodys taking 

them out at the same time within a few months of each other 

the same  percent mortgage 

how can you tell from this graph that theyre not 

exercising their option optimally 

its completely obvious 

just looking at it for one second you can say 

oh these people cant be exercising their option 

optimally why is that 

yes 

they should be exercising all at the same  

if they were acting rationally 

so as he says weve just done the  

with those s and s 


i told you when the right time to exercise the option is 

so everybodys got the same circumstance 

every single person if all theyre trying to do is minimize 

the present value of their payments they should all be 

prepaying at the same time 

here you see that very few people are prepaying 

but its getting up to almost  percent so probably this is a 

stupid time to prepay but the point is still  

percent of them are prepaying 

and over here when presumably you ought to prepay
