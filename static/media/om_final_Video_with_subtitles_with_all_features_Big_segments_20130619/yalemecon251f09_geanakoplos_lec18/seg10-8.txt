what does hedging mean 

and i want to put it in the context the old context of the 

world series which we started with before 

so its easier to understand there 

and so many of you will have thought about this before so 

youll be able to answer it but if i put it in the mortgage 

context it would seem just too difficult 

i dont know why i did that 

so the world seriesim going to lower it in a second 

so suppose that the yankees have a  percent chance 

i said beating the dodgers i thought the dodgers would be 

in the world series a  percent chance of winning 


any game against the phillies in the world series 

and you are a bookie and your fellow bookies all understand 

that its  percent 

so some naive philly fan comes to you and says i want to bet 

 dollars that the phillies win the world series 

should you take the bet or not 

yes you should take the bet because  percent of the time 

youre going to win  dollarsno 


yes you should take the bet 

if he bet on one game you would make with  percent 

probability youd win  and with  percent probability 

youd lose  

so that means on average your expectation is equal to  

so if hes willing to bet  dollars on the phillies winning 

the first game of the series with you 

you know that your expected chance of winning is  dollars 

youre expecting to win  dollars from the guy 

now suppose hes willing to make the same bet 

 dollars for the entire series 

whats your chance of winning and whats your expected profit 

from him 

is it less than  or more than  

more than   

more than   

its going to turn out to be so a  game series 

its going to turn out to be  which were going to figure out 

in a second 

but whats your risk 

whats your risk 

in either case you might lose  dollars 

the phillies theyre probably going to lose 

but theres a chance something goes crazy and some unknown guy 

hits five home runs in the first four games or something 

and some other unknown guy hits another four home runs and you 

lose the world series 

you could lose  dollars and maybe the guys not betting 

 dollars but  thousand dollars or a hundred million 


dollars 

you know youve got a favorable bet but you dont want to run 

the risk of losing even though theres not that high a chance 

youre going to lose 

what can you do about it 

well you know that there are these other bookies out there 

who every game are willing to bet at odds  either 

direction on the phillies or the yankees because they just all 

know theyre just like you 

you all know that the odds are  percent for the yankees 

winning every game 

so suppose this naive guy the phillies fan 

comes up to you and bets  dollars on the world series that 

the phillies will win 

you dont want to run the risk of losing  dollars 

you know there are these other bookies who are willing to take 

bets a game at a time  odds 

what should you be doing 

what would you do 

yes 

bet on the phillies winning because  

give you better odds so youre guaranteed your profit 

so what would you  

so this guys come to you and youre not going to be able 

to give the were going to find out exactly 

what you should do in one second 

but lets just see how far you can get by reason without 

calculation 

so this guys come to you and said im betting  

dollars on the phillies winning the world series 


this is the night before the first game 

every bookie is standing by ready to take bets at  to  

odds 

what would you do 

youd bet with the bookie that the  

would win because 

that what  

that the phillies would  

yeah how much  

 dollars  

youd bet the whole   

well you get better  


so 

but would you bet the whole  dollars on  

first game 

the guys only bet  dollars on the whole series 

youd bet  b 

dollars 

so its not so obvious what to  

right but hes got exactly the right idea 

you can hedge your bet 

so here we are 

i shouldnt have put that down 

dont tell me i turned it off 

that would just kill me 

god i meant to hit mute 

i think i hit off 

oh how dumb 

so you would bet on thewhile that warms up 

i can see it 

all right so what happens is youll have a tree which looks 


like this and like this like this and like this 

like this and like this and lets say we go out a few games 

like this 

now this is a   game series 

all right so ive done it 

heres the start of world series 

this is the world series spreadsheet you had before 

now heres the start 

heres game     

so if the yankees win the series they get  dollars 

you get  dollars sorry 

oh what an idiot 

so every time you end up above the start win more than you 

lose you get  dollars 

on the other hand if you lose more than you win 

you lose  dollars and so ctrl 

copy 

here is losing  dollars 

so now this tree remember from doing it before 


is just by backward induction 

if you look at this thing up there it says you get 

 percent i think was the number we figured out over here 

so right 

so  percent is the probability of the yankees 

winning a game 

so you take any node like this one youre always taking  

percent of the value up here plus  percent of the value 

here 

so if you do that you find out that the value to you is  


dollars just what we said 

so lets put that in the middle of the screen 

so the value is  dollars 

now if the yankees win the first game youre in much better 

shape 

so winning the first game means you moved up to this node here 

all of a sudden you went from  dollars to  dollars 

and if the yankees lost the first game you would have gone 

down to that value which is like  dollars 

your expected winnings when the yankees are down a game 

you know theyre still a better team so actually its 

more likely even after losing the first game that the yankees 


would still win the series 

so you see the risk that youre running and you can calculate 

this 

so what should you do in the very first game 

this tells you that your expected winnings is  

of course  times  thats   times  is  

that is  dollars 

so thats  because its the average of this and this 

and  is the average of  of this and  of that 

so what should you do 

well on average youre going to make  dollars 

whats the essence of hedging 

you want to guarantee that you make  dollars no matter what 

happens 

no matter who wins the series you want to end up with  extra 

dollars assuming the interest rate is  from the beginning to 

the end of the series 

so how can you arrange that 

what can you do 

well so thats the mystery 

ill give you one second to try and think it through 

you should get this 

what would you do here 

are there no baseball bookies in theyep 

didnt we just bring this up before like
