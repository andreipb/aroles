seem to be around  percent when nothings happening 

so you say  percent plus maybe youre going to get some 

more prepayments so you might writewell i just wrote down a 

function plus the min 

the min say of  because it never seems 

to get over  percent if you look at that you see it never 

gets over  percent really 

so the min of  and  times the max of  and m  

rs  sigma over  

that would be a kind of prepayment function 

so what does this say 

what happens 

youre normally going to payso this is this whole 

function here so i should write this as  

plus can you see that over there 

maybe not so this plus  

so theres a baseline of  percent and if the interest rate 

is high so the interest rate is above 

the mortgage rate no one else is going to prepay because this is 

going to be a negative number and this will be  

so youre just going to do  percent 

on the other hand as the interest rate gets low 

and falls far enough below the mortgage rate people are going 

to say to themselves ahha 

i have a big incentive to prepay now 

maybe interest rates have gone down so far i can no longer hope 

theyre going to go back up above the mortgage rate 

i should start prepaying more 

so more people are going to prepay and this thing is going 

to go up 


i just multiply it by some constant but itll never go up 

more than  percent 

thats what this function says 

and sigma this is the volatilityall right 

so lets just leave that aside 

so theres a prepayment function that seems to sort of 

capture whats going on 

its usually around  percent when theres no incentive 

it never gets above  percent but as the incentive to prepay 


as interest rates get lower and the incentive to prepay 

increases more and more people prepay 

thats kind of the idea 

all right and then you would fit fancier curves than that 

you would look at m  rt and you would fit 

a curve that looks like this 

so if theres just a little bit of incentive to prepay 

the rates are a little bit lower than the mortgage rate 

nobody does it 

then quickly a lot of people do it and then they stop doing it 

so this is like  percent and most of the time youre around 


 percent and you try and fit this curve 

youre going to have millions of parameters and since you have 

so much data you could fit parameters 

that was the old fashioned way and thats how people would 

predict prepayments 

now thats not going to turn out to be such a great way 

but it certainly teaches you something 

so lets look at what happens if you nowwith those realistic 

prepayments you compute the value of a mortgage 

so this is the prepayment that youd get for the different 

rates and so you can see that as the rates go down the total 

prepayment is going up 

and by the way its more than  percent 

because youve got this  percent added to the  percent 


so the most it could be is  percent 

which it hits over here 

so you get  percent as the maximum prepayments 

and as interest rates get higher no one prepays except the 

 percent of guys 

now by the way why are people prepaying over 

here even when the rates are so high 

its because some people are moving or theyre getting 

divorced and they have to sell their house 

so obviously youre going to get some prepayments no matter 

what 

people have to prepay and why is it that people never 

prepay more than  percent historically or  percent 

because not everybody pays attention 


now i called them the dumb guys last time 

but as i said i probably fit into that 

category 

its people who are distracted and doing other things 

theyre just not paying attention and so they dont 

realize 

they dont know whats going on so they dont realize they 

should be prepaying 

so as interest rates go down more people prepay 

as interest rates go up less people prepay 

and if you did some historical thing and figured out the right 

parameters youd get a prepayment function 


so how did i figure out this was  

how did i figure out this was  

why should i divide this by  

whats sigma 

once you get those parameters historically you now have a 

welldetermined behavior rule of what people are going to prepay 

and from that you can figure out what the prices are of any 

mortgage by backward induction 

so how would you do it again by backward induction 

the same we always did it 

over here what would you do over here 

how would you change this rule 

well you would just be feeding in the prepayment function 

so what would the prepayment function be 

well people wouldnt be doing a minimum here 

right 

theyre not deciding whether or not to prepay 


theyre just prepaying 

so lets get rid of that 

theyre prepaying 

so this is the value of  dollars left of principal 

so some of them are prepaying and thats the function 

so prepay and that depends on what node youre at 

and here it says what percentage of the remaining 

balance is being prepaid 

so that tells you that rule whos prepaying 


and then with the rest of the money thats going on until next 

time  minus that same thing  minus prepay times exactly 

what we had before 

so this part of  dollar got prepaid immediately so thats 

the cash that went to the mortgage holder 

the rest of the cash got saved until next time and heres what 

happens to it 

you have to make your coupon then you have a remaining 

balance and then whatever is going to happen is going to 

happen 

so youll study this and youll figure out im sure 


it takes a little bit of effort to see that through 

but with half an hour staring at it youll understand how this 

works and youll read it in a spreadsheet so you can figure 

out the value of a mortgage 

you get a value of a mortgage and now we can start doing 

experiments by changing the parameters and see how the 

mortgage works 

now before i do that i want to say that theres a better way to 

do this 

i mean maybe these numbers are estimatedwhats a better way 

of doing it 

how did i do it at ellington how did wei mean at kidder
