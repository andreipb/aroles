  it depends a little bit on the temperature 

about  miles per hour 

when i speak to you my sound reaches you with that speed 

i produce a certain frequency here 

a certain number of oscillations per second 

they reach you 

your eardrum starts to oscillate with the same frequency 

and you hear that tone 

i have here a tuning fork 

which oscillates  times per second 

 tuning fork  mediumpitched   

your eardrum oscillates  times per second 

you hear this tone 

here i have  oscillations per second 

 metal rod emits lower   


your eardrum is now shaking 

going back and forth  times per second 

if you stay where you are and you dont move 

and i move these tuning forks 

you will hear a different frequency 

and thats what we call doppler effect 

if my sound source approaches you 

you will hear a frequency f prime which is larger 

than the frequency of the tuning fork 

if it moves away from you which i will call receding 

then f prime equals lower lower frequency 

for instance i move to you a sound source 

i call that a transmitter 

with a speed of about one meters per second 

transmitter is the sound transmitter 

then if it approaches you here you will hear f prime 

which is  times f 

this three here is the one part out of  

that you get an increase in frequency 

if i move it away from you then f prime would be 

 times the frequency of the source itself 


you stay where you are 

i have here a tuning fork which generates  hertz 

a very high frequency 

if i move it to you with the speed of one meter per second 

which i can do then you get an increase in pitch of  

that makes it  hertz 

and when i move it away from you there is a decrease of  

and you can clearly hear that difference 

i will first make you listen to the  hertz 

without my moving 

 tuning fork  very high pitched   

can you hear it very high frequency 

is it painful really 

high frequency 

most of you are young enough 


you should be able to hear  hertz 

okay now i am going to move it to you one meter per second 

and away from you 

 high tone goes up and  slightly in   

did you hear it once more 

 tone goes up and  quickly   

 class   

when it comes to you its clear that the frequency goes up 

and when it moves away from you the frequency is down 

now imagine that im going to rotate the sound source 


around in a circle 

now the sound that you receive the frequency that you receive 

will change in a sinusoidal fashion 

if this is that circle and this is the radius of that circle 

and if you are here in the plane of the circle 

then when the source comes straight to you 

with the velocity v lets say its a uniform circular motion 

f prime will be larger than f 

and it will in this case reach a maximum 

when it is at  degrees relative to you 

i dont have to give it a vector notation 

f prime equals f 

when it moves away from you f prime is smaller than f 

you hear a minimum 

and when it is here again 

when the angle between the velocity and your direction 

is again  degrees then f prime equals f again 

and so this phenomenon is called the doppler effect 

so if i twirl it around 

you will hear a sinusoidal fluctuation in f prime 

suppose i plot as a function of time f prime 

the way you will receive it you sit still 

but im going to move the sound source around like this 


then you will have a curve that looks something like 

some sinusoidalcosinusoidal fluctuation of f prime 

this will be the value f 

produced by the sound source itself 

this will be f prime maximum and this will be f prime minimum 

if you could record this there is an amazing number of things 

that you can deduce from this curve 

first of all you can take 

you can measure f prime max divided by f 

because you see this curve so you know what f is here 


you see what f prime max is 

and that should allow you to retrieve immediately 

v velocity of the transmitter 

if that number were  then you know 

that the speed in the orbit was one meter per second 

so this ratio immediately gives you the transmitter velocity 

this time separation gives you immediately 

the period of rotation 

but since two pi r if r is the radius 

divided by the velocity of the transmitter 


since that is the oh i can reverse it it doesnt matter 

two pi r divided by the time to go around 

is the velocity of the transmitter 

since you know the velocity of the transmitter from this ratio 

since you know the period which is this 

you now also find the radius r 

so from that curve and keep that with you 


because its going to be important in what follows 

we can derive three 

the radius the period of rotation 

and the speed of the object as i twirl it around 

i have here what we call a wind organ 

when i twirl this around it produces a particular tone 

we will talk later about  

why it produces a particular tone 

sometimes you hear two tones 

ill try to make you hear only one 

and as i swirl it around the sound is coming 

the sound source the transmitter is coming to you 

this when it goes like this its degree angle 

so you should not hear any doppler shift 

when it is here its moved away from you 

and so you hear a sinusoidal change in f prime 

try to hear that 

 wind organ producing  that changes   

can you hear when its coming to you that its higherpitched 


than when its going away from you 

can you hear that 

just say no if you dont hear it 

not very clear 

 wind organ again  varying   

for me its impossible to hear 

because im standing right under it of course 

well i tried 



i now want to change to electromagnetic waves 

electromagnetic waves travel with the speed of light 

which is  kilometers per second 

and if you want to treat that correctly 

you would have to use special relativity 

in the case of sound i stressed repeatedly 

that you in the audience should not move 

but that the sound source is moving 

in the case of electromagnetic radiation 

when you deal with the speed of light 

you dont have to ask that question 

it is a meaningless question in special relativity 

to ask whether you are moving relative to me 

or whether i am moving relative to you it doesnt matter 

all that matters in special relativity 

is the relative motion 

so you can always think of yourself as standing still 

and make the source of electromagnetic radiation 

move to you or away from you relative to you
