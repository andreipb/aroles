about ten kilometers 

you will find that that velocity becomes 

about two times ten to the eighth meters per second 

which is about  of the speed of light 

and because of this enormousi speed 

onehalf mv squared is horrendously high 

it is a conversion 

of gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy 

and then ultimately to heat 

now nature is transferring mass at an extraordinarily high rate 

in many of these binary systems 

there are at least some hundred or so that we know 

in our own galaxy 

the mass transfer rate which i call dmdt 

so that is the transfer rate 

from the donor onto the neutron star 

that transfer rate 

is roughly ten to the th kilograms per second 


it is a horrendousi mass transfer rate 

you can calculate 

by multiplying it with onehalf v squared 

how many joules per second are released 

in the form of kinetic energy 

that means in the form of heat 

and i call that the power of that neutron star 

and that then for this mass transfer rate 

thats about two times ten to the th joules per second 

which is watts 

and that is about  times larger 


than the power of our own sun 

but the temperature of this neutron star 

because of this enormous amount of energy released 

the temperature would reach values 

of about ten million degrees kelvin 

and at that high temperature 

the neutron star would emit almost exclusively xrays 

you and i are very cold bodies only  degrees kelvin 

we radiate electromagnetic radiation 

in the infrared part of the spectrum 

we have warm bodies 

when you hold someone in your arms you can feel that 

if i would heat you up to  degrees kelvin 

you would become redhot 

and you actually 

we could turn the light off and i would see you 

youre just emitting red light 

if i would heat you up to three million degrees 

you would start to begin to radiate in xrays 

you may not like it but thats a detail of course 

so i want you to appreciate the fact that the 

the kind of radiation that you get depends strongly 

on the temperature and at ten million degrees 


youre dealing almost exclusively with xrays 



so these binary systems are very potent sources of xrays 

the neutron stars rotate around we discussed that earlier 

conservation of angular momentum 

and they have strong magnetic fields 

the matter that falls onto the neutron star 

already heats up during the infall 

because there is gravitational potential energy released 

and so the matter is so hot 

that in general its highly ionized 

and highly ionized material cannot reach 

a magnetic neutron star 

in all locations that it prefers to do so 

in  you will learn why thats the case 

however the matter can reach 

the neutron star at the magnetic poles 

and so what youre going to see now is 

youre going to have a neutron star with magnetic poles 

so the matter streams in onto the magnetic poles 

which gives you two hot spots 

and if the axis of rotation doesnt coincide 

with the line through the two hot spots 

if the neutron star rotates 

youre going to see xray pulsations 

when the hot spot is here you will see xrays 

and when the hot spot is here you will not see xrays 


and so we observe from these systems xray pulsations 

now think of the following 

the xray pulsations are a clock 

it is the clock of the rotating neutron star 

if the neutron star in a binary system 

because all of these are in a binary system 

these xray binaries 

if its coming to you you see doppler shift 

the ticks of the clock come a little closer together 


if the neutron star moves away from you 

the ticks of the clocks are a little bit further apart 

that is exactly what doppler shift is all about 

so by timing the pulses of the xrays 

you can get a handle 

on the doppler shift of the neutron star 

that means you can get the speed of the neutron star 

you can get the radius of the orbit 

and you can get the period just like we discussed before 


but now you take an optical 

the xray observations by the way have to be made 

from outside the earths atmosphere 

because xrays are absorbed by the earths atmosphere 

now you take an optical telescope 

and you look from the ground 

and now you see the optical spectrum of the donor 

and what do you see in the donor 

you see these absorption lines 

and as the donor moves around the center of mass 

these absorption lines move back and forth 

the doppler shift of the donor 

so you know the velocity of the donor 

you know the radius of the donor 

not the radius of the donor 

you know the radius of the orbit and you know the period 

so now we have a situation that i just described earlier 


that you have the doppler shift of both objects 

and remember i told you that you also get the masses 

you get the mass of the donor and the mass of the accretor 



before i go ahead let me show you some slides 

so we have to lower this again if thats possible yep 



i want to show you 

an artists conception of such a binary system 




so this is what it may look like 

you see the donor there 

and you see the neutron star right here 

so small of course that its invisible 

and this is the accretion disk 

swirls in the matter ends up on the neutron star 

and this is another view that gives you an idea of the donor 

and then the swirl of matter 

and then it swirls in and ends up here on the neutron star 


and here you see data that were obtained in  

its clear evidence for the existence 

of these rotating neutron stars with these xray hot spots 

you see here the observed xray intensity as a function of time 

and the actual data are these very thin lines 

and this bold line was drawn over by the authors 

to convince you that you see a signal which is highly periodic 

the time from here to here is  seconds 

this object was called hercules x 

so this is one of the magnetic poles 

and this is the other magnetic pole 

one magnetic pole and the other magnetic pole 

so you see here unmistakably the rotation of the neutron star 

and the xray pulsations 

here you see data from the same object 

but now the time scale is very different 

from here to here is one day 

this is two days 

and when you look at this data alone forget this for now 

notice that you see the source is active in xrays 

the second oscillations 

you cannot see of course anymore 

because the time scale is different 

but notice here there are no xrays at 

 days later no xrays at all
