 days later no xrays at all 

and so what youre looking at here 

are what we call xray eclipses 

when the neutron star moves behind the donor star 

all the xrays are absorbed by the donor star 

and you get xray eclipses 

in other words you get 

independently from the doppler shift 

you also get the period of the orbit by the xray eclipses 

and this really changed our whole concept of astronomy 

the existence of these neutron star binaries 

and now comes a part what are the masses of these objects 


i already alluded you to the idea 

of the possibility that there may be black holes 

all the mass measurements that have been done to date 

of these neutron stars where you see the pulsations 

all of them are very close to  solar mass 

and theres a good reason for that thats not an accident 

in  the physicist chandrasekhar predicted 

that white dwarfs could not exist 

if their mass is larger than  solar mass 

it was a quantum mechanical calculation 

for which he received in  the nobel prize 

remember we discussed white dwarfs earlier 

a white dwarf has about a radius of  kilometers 

about the same as the earth 

and imagine that you have a white dwarf 

and you add matter to the white dwarf 

and you pass the solarmass mark 

then the white dwarf will collapse 

and becomes a neutron star 

and so when we measure the masses of neutron stars 

it turns out maybe somewhat by surprise 


that theyre all very close to  

if you could add more matter to the neutron star 

by accreting more and more matter 

and you reach the point that the neutron star becomes 

as massive as three times the mass of the sun 

we believe that the neutron star can no longer support itself 

and becomes a black hole 

and so now comes the question what is a black hole 

a black hole is the most bizarre object that you can imagine 

and it is something 

that you want to stay away from too 


a black hole has no size unlike a neutron star 

it has no size but it does have mass and it has a lot of mass 

three times the mass of the sun ten times the mass of the sun 

a hundred times the mass of the sun 

so it has mass but it has no size 

we identify around the black hole a sphere with radius r 


which we call the event horizon 



imagine you are at the event horizon 

and you want to get away from the black hole 

what kind of speed do you need 

you should be able to give me that answer immediately 

the escape velocity must be 

 mg divided by the radius of that event horizon 

in other words the radius of the event horizon itself 

equals  mg divided by c squared 

if you tell me what m is 

i will tell you what the radius of the event horizon is 



i went a little fast here 

i skipped an important step 

v is the escape velocity from the event horizon 

which is at a distance capital r from the mass m 

so we see that here 

now this escape velocity can never be larger 

than the speed of light so the maximum value possible is c 

and if now you look at this part of this equation 

and you take the radius on one side 

youll get that the radius of the event horizon 

equals  mg divided by c squared 

and thats how i found that equation 

sorry that i went a little too fast 



if m is the mass of the earth 

the radius of the event horizon is one centimeter 

if m is the mass of the sun 

the radius of the event horizon is three kilometers 

if m is three times the mass of the sun 

the radius of the event horizon would become ten kilometers 


it scales linearly with the mass 

if you were inside the event horizon 

you could never escape the black hole 

because you would need 

a speed which is larger than the speed of light 

therefore you can never escape from inside the event horizon 

nothing can get out of it 

not xrays no radio emission no light nothing 

once youre inside the event horizon youve had it 

you cannot escape it 

and so the question now that comes 

can we see xrays from a black hole 


because if nothing can come out of a black hole 

how can we see xrays 

and the answer is yes we can 

because as long as the matter that swirls in 

is outside the event horizon it would still be very hot 

because gravitational potential energy 

would already have been released it would be very hot 

and it would emit xrays 

so we can see xrays outside a black hole 

however you will never see pulsations 

because a black hole has no surface like a neutron star 

so theres no such thing 

as two hot spots which rotate around 

and so now comes the problem for 

how can you determine the mass of the accretor 


if the accretor is not a pulsating neutron star 

but if the accretor is a black hole 

well you can only now measure the doppler shift of the donor 

because the donor in general is quite well visible 

its an optical star 

but you will not be able to measure 

the doppler shift of the black hole no pulsations 

if however an astronomer can make an estimate 

of the mass of that donor 

then you will find the mass of the accretor 

in other words instead of having 

the doppler shift measurements of both stars 

the neutron star and the donor star 

which gives you the mass of two stars 

now you have to settle for the doppler shift of only the donor 

and the mass of the donor itself 

and if you have a reasonable idea of what that mass will be 

then you can find the mass of the accretor 

and there is a very famous case 

that was the first one discovered in the early s 

which is called cygnus x 

cygnus x is an xray binary 

which has an orbital period of  days 

the doppler shift measurements of the donor were made 

and astronomers simply looking at the spectrum 

at the absorption lines 

and the structure of the absorption lines 

and the kind of absorption lines 

were able to say yeah the mass of the donor 

is probably approximately  solar masses 

and with that information and with the doppler shift 

you can now arrive at the mass of the accretor 

and that is in this case 

oh by the way 

there is an r missing in the word accretion there 

that mass turns out to be about  solar masses 



now when this was found in the early s 

most people concluded this has to be a black hole 

it is a very compact object 

otherwise it wouldnt emit xrays in the first place 

and clearly if the mass of that compact object 

is way larger than three solar masses 

then there is no doubt in our minds that this is a black hole 

since that time 

many black hole xray binaries have been discovered 

so if i summarize the amazing thing is 

from studying the doppler shift 

of binary systems like xray binaries 

you can derive the orbital parameters orbital radius 


orbital periods the speed of the stars in orbit 

but you can also find the masses 

and whenever you make a measurement of the mass 

when it is a neutron star 

when you see the xray pulsations 

you almost always find 

that it is very close to  times the mass of the sun 

but in a few cases you will find 

that the mass is substantially larger 

admittedly you have to do without the doppler shift then 

of the accretor but you have to use some other information 

and then you can conclude in most cases 

with pretty good confidence 

that youre dealing with something like 

bizarre as a black hole 


which you can only define the event horizon 

and you can never escape a black hole 

when youre inside the event horizon 

because that is when the escape velocity 

would be larger than the speed of light 

so this is the escape velocity 

if you set that equal to c 

then you can solve for the radius of the event horizon 

and out of it pops this equation 

i would like to show you now a slide of cygnus x 

which is the oldest known black hole xray binary 



i have to lower the screen 



and there it comes 



this was really a bombshell when this was discovered 

i still remember reading that first publication 

two people discovered this independently by the way 

they came independently to the same conclusion 

tom bolton and it was paul merlin 

two independent groups
