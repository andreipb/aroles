electromagnetic radiation is optical light infrared 

ultraviolet radio xrays gamma rays 

all of that is electromagnetic radiation 

if the velocity of the source of electromagnetic radiation 

the transmitter 

if that is way way smaller than the speed of light 

then it is very easy to predict 

the change in frequency due to doppler shift 

let this be the transmitter which produces frequency f 

and here is the receiver which receives the frequency f prime 

and let the velocity 

of the source of electromagnetic radiation be v 

i could put transmitter here but we can drop that index 

and let this angle be theta 

then this is the component in your direction 

we call that the radial component 

which is v cosine theta 

so i delete the tr 

this is just the velocity of the source 

relative to you at that angle 



if now we want to know what f prime is 

then f prime equals f times one plus v over c 

times the cosine of theta 

what matters is only the radial component of the velocity 

this is the radial component 


if theta is  degrees just like we had with sound 

then f prime equals f 

so  degrees the cosine of theta is zero 

f prime equals f 

if theta is smaller than  degrees 

then its coming towards you 

then f prime equals larger than f 

if theta equals larger than  degrees 

its going away from you 

then f prime equals smaller than f 



you would get a similar equation for sound 

by replacing this c by the speed of sound 

but i want to stress 


that this only holds for electromagnetic radiation 

if v over c is much much smaller than one 



now when we deal with sound 

there is something mechanically oscillating 

something is vibrating 

with electromagnetic radiation charges are vibrating 

electrons are vibrating 

and they are vibrating with a certain frequency 

and that means 

there is a certain period of one oscillation 

and that period of one oscillation is of course 

one over the frequency 

i can ask myself now the question 

how far does electromagnetic radiation 

how far does light travel in the time of one period capital t 

well it goes with the speed of light 

so in t seconds it moves a distance ct 

and that distance we call 

the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation 


lambda equals ct for which you can also write c divided by f 

so this is the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation 

the speed of light  kilometers per second 

the period of one oscillation say of the electrons 

and this is the frequency which you can give in hertz 

i could give you a specific example 

i for instance can take a period t 

of two times ten to the minus  seconds 

that would give me a wavelength 

of about six times ten to the minus seven meters 

six times ten to the minus seven meters 

and that you would experience as red light 

if i make the period shorter 

say  times ten to the minus  seconds 


i get a shorter wavelength 

i get four times ten to the minus seven meters 

and you would experience that as blue light 



in astronomy in optical astronomy 

we cannot measure the period or the frequency of optical light 

all we can measure is the wavelength 

and so if i want to use this equation 

then i have to replace f prime by c divided by lambda prime 

and f i have to replace by c divided by lambda 

and when i do that i get the following result 

i get lambda prime equals lambda 

times one minus v over c cosine theta 

if this is a plus this is a minus 

check that for yourself 

you have to use the small number approximation 

the taylor expansion 

namely that v over c is much much smaller than one 

so you can see now if the object comes to you 

in other words if f prime is larger than f 

if the frequency is higher then the wavelength will be smaller 

and so let me write that down 

when the cosine of theta so the object is coming to you 


when the cosine of theta is larger than zero 

the object is approaching you 

then the wavelength lambda prime will be less than lambda 

and that has a name we call that blue shift 

and the reason why we call that blue shift is 

that if the wavelengths become shorter 

it moves towards the blue end of the spectrum 

because blue has a lower wavelength than red 

if cosine theta is negative 

then the object is receding from you 

then lambda prime is larger than lambda 


and we call that red shift 

these are the terms that astronomers use all the time 

when you make a spectrum of a star 

you can do that using prisms or by other means 

and you look at the light intensity 

as a function of wavelength 

so here is the light intensity as a function of wavelength 

then you may expect to see some kind of a continuum 

but in fact what you do see is 

superimposed on a continuum 

you see sometimes very sharp absorption lines 

black missing light called absorption lines 

and these absorption lines correspond 

to elements in the atmosphere of the star 

in fact if you see the absorption lines you can tell 

what kind of elements are present in the star 

some are very characteristic absorption 

some for hydrogen some for calcium some for silicon 

some for magnesium and so on 

its actually interesting 

that when you look at the spectrum of the sun 

when people did that first 

when they had the means of doing that 

they found absorption lines in the spectrum of the sun 

which could not be identified 

they had never been seen here on earth these lines 

and so they called these lines after the sun 


the sun is helios and so they called it helium 

so helium was first discovered on the sun 

before it was later discovered on earth 

by looking at the absorption lines of the solar spectrum 

if a star moves to you then all the lines 

every single line will be blueshifted 

and if the star moves away from you 

all the lines will be redshifted 

if you take an 

with lambda prime divided by lambda 

and you pick any one of those lines 


it doesnt matter which you pick 

because they will all do exactly the same 

if this were for instance  

i just pick a very nice number 

that means lambda prime as you see is larger than lambda 

the wavelengths get longer so we have a red shift 

and you substitute that in that equation 

then youll find that the velocity 

at which that star is moving relative to you 

that gives you immediately the answer there 

equals minus  times the speed of light c 

and that is minus  kilometers per second 

and the minus then reminds you 

that the object is receding from you 

so that gives you a red shift 



i just wrote down 

that the velocity v is minus  kilometers per second 

its of course v cosine theta 

that is minus  kilometers per second 

its the radiali velocity thats all you can measure 


you have no information on theta 

so it is this component v cosine theta 

which we call the radial velocity 

that is minus  kilometers per second 



half of all the stars in the sky are binaries 

and so when you look at the spectra 

you will see them go around each other 

and so you in principle can measure the red shifts 

and the blue shifts as they go around each other 

you see doppler effect 

if they come to you you see blue shift
