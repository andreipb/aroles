if they go away from you you see red shift 

so in principle 

you can determine for each one of those stars 

the velocity in orbit the radius of their orbit 

and of course the period of the binary system 

so its an extremely powerful tool in astronomy 

if you have a binary system when the stars exactly do this 

to determine 

all these quantities that you would like to know 

i first would like to show you now some slides 



the first slide oh i have to lower the screen by the way 

that would help wouldnt it 

 chucklesi  

the first slide is a spectrum made in the laboratory 

of hydrogen helium and calcium and sodium 

it shows you emission lines no absorption lines 

these lines are produced by lamps 

and the frequencies are very well known 

here you see the famous sodium yellow lines 

so here is the red part of the spectrum 

and there is the blue part of the spectrum 



so we know these frequencies 

we know these wavelengths very well 

and here you see the spectrum of the sun 

with all these absorption lines that i mentioned to you 

its plastered with absorption lines 

and each of them can be identified 

these are due to calcium iron hydrogen and so on 

here is the blue part of the spectrum 


here is the green part the green part 

and here is the red part of the spectrum 



and here you see the basic idea behind a binary system 

suppose you have a binary system 

that only one star is visible and the other one is invisible 

and the one star shows you three clear absorption lines 

then as the star moves around the center of mass 

you see that all these lines drift in unison 

and out of this information 

you get the radius the velocity and the period 

assuming that you are on earth 

in the plane of the orbit of the stars 

if you have a binary system whereby both stars are visible 

so you get the spectrum of both stars 

then you see the doppler shift of both stars in the spectrum 

here we have a simple case 

that we only have two absorption lines not to confuse the issue 

and so in one in the case of one star 

the shift will be towards the left of the two lines 

but the other star the shift will be to the right 

because if you have a binary system 

when one star comes to you 

the other star goes away from you and vice versa 

so now you are very lucky now you have an ideal situation 


that you can find for both stars the radius of the orbit 

the velocity in orbit and the period for each star 

which of course is the same for both 



and here you see real data 

you see here first of all 

the emission lines which are measured in the laboratory 

that i just showed you 

they are always done simultaneously 

with the measurements 

you always must be sure 

that you have a good calibration of your wavelength 


and this spectrum a the top spectrum is of a star 

a binary system that has a period of  days 

and you see here single lines if you have good eyes 

that means at this very moment 

both stars move relative to you at angles of  degrees 

so you dont see any doppler shift 

but now look here 

later in time you see that this line has split in two lines 


and this one has also split in two lines 

clearly one component is coming to you 

and the other component is moving away from you 

and so you get all this useful information in astronomy 

by making the doppler shift measurements of binary systems 



i want to pursue the idea of binary stars 

they give us 

not only the information that we want regarding the orbits 

but there is even more that we can get out of it 

which is even more exciting 

so i will remind you what a binary system looks like 



remember the second exam 

im sure you will never forget that second exam 

and maybe never forgive me for that 



binary star one radius r mass m velocity v 

and star two going about their common center of mass 

mass m radius r and velocity v 

m r equals m r 

thats the way the center of mass is defined 

imagine that you as an observer 

are somewhere in the plane of this orbit and you are here 

and you are observing the system going around 

keplers third law which you derived on your exam 

as well as on an the period squared equals 

four pi squared times r plus r to the power three 

divided by g times m plus m 

let me check that to make sure i have that right 

yes that is correct 

imagine now you can make 

the doppler shift measurements of both stars 

you make the doppler shift measurement of star number one 

so you measure lambda one prime as a function of time 

out of that pops immediately the period of rotation 

out of that pops the velocity as we discussed 

out of that pops the radius r 

and now you measure 

the doppler shift of star two as a function of time 

out of that pops the period 

which of course better be the same 


out of that pops its velocity in orbit 

and out of it pops its radius 

all these things come out of the doppler shift measurements 

but if you know r and you know r 

then you also know r plus r 

so you know this part in keplers third law 

since you also know the periods you can find what m plus m is 

so now you get an extra bonus 

you know now what the sum of the mass of the two stars is 

in the binary system but you also know that m r is m r 

so now you have two equations 

you know what m plus m is 

and you know this equation and you can solve for m and m 


which is an amazing thing when you come to think of it 

so we finally end up 

with the mass of star one and the mass of star two 

all this comes out of doppler shift 

the velocities the radii the periods 

and even the masses of these objects 

now if you as an observer on earth 

are not exactly in the plane of the orbit 

then the situation is a little bit more complicated 

and i will not discuss that here today 

because in principle 

it doesnt affect the idea behind doppler shift 

but for astronomers it is very important 

its really a nuisance 

but i will not discuss that in any detail 

i want to discuss a fascinating application 

that we have in xray astronomy 

namely we have xray binaries 



what is an xray binary 

well it is a binary system 

this is a star not unlike our sun 

it has as certain mass has a certain radius 

and it is in orbit lets say with a neutron star 

even though it could be a black hole 

but for now lets just assume it is a neutron star 

and if these two masses are the same 

which i only use for the sake of simplicity 

in practice they could be very different 

then there is a point between these two right in the middle 

whereby the gravitational pull in one direction is the same 

as the gravitational pull in the other direction 

and we call that the inner lagrangian point 

in other words if you were there 

the neutron star would pull at you 

with exactly the same force as the other star 

so you wouldnt know where to go 

if this inner legrangian point lies 

below the surface of this star that means 

if the stars are a little closer than i have drawn them here 

then the matter of this star will fall 

towards the neutron star 

because the pull in this direction is then larger 

than the pull in this direction 

now of course this system is a binary system 

they go around in the plane of the blackboard say 


and so this matter cannot fall radially in 

but it will fall in and spiral in 

and forms what we call an accretion disk 

around the neutron star 

this is called the accretor and this is called the donor 

there is mass transfer from the donor to the neutron star 

oops i just noticed i misspelled the word accretion 

there is an r in accretion 

and as that occurs 

there is a tremendous amount of energy that is released 

i want to blow up the neutron star 

very simple  considerations now 

what comes is extremely pedestrian 

this is the mass of the neutron star 

and this is the radius of the neutron star 

and i take a little bit of matter m 

and i drop it from a large distance onto the neutron star 

at what speed 

will that little piece of matter reach the neutron star 

you should almost be able to close your eyes 

and give me that answer right now 

the kinetic energy when it reaches the neutron star 

equals onehalf m v squared 

that is the speed 

at which it will crash onto the neutron star 

and that must be 

mm neutron star g divided by the radius of the neutron star 

you always lose your m and so you find 

that the speed at which it reaches the neutron star 

is the square root of two m neutron star 

times g divided by r neutron star 

you should remember this equation 

this was the equation that we had for escape velocity 

if you were here and you go back to infinity 

you reach exactly that speed so if you fall in from infinity 

that is exactly the speed 

at which you reach the neutron star 


it should obviously be the same number 

and you dont really have to be infinitely far away 

you just have to be much further away 

than the radius of the neutron star 

when this matter crashes onto the neutron star 

the kinetic energy that is released is onehalf mv squared 

it is converted to heat and to give you some feeling 

for the incredible power of a neutron star 

if you make this little m as little as ten grams 


think of it as a pretty fullsized marshmallow 

and you throw a marshmallow 

from a large distance onto a neutron star 

the energy that is released is comparable 

to the atomic bomb that was used on hiroshima 

a tengram object thrown onto a neutron star 

the reason being that this velocity 

becomes enormously high 

if you put in for the neutron star 

a mass of about three times ten to the th kilograms 

and you take for the radius of the neutron star
