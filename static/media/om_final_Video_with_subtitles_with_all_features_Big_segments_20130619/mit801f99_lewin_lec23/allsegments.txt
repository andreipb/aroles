  it depends a little bit on the temperature 

about  miles per hour 

when i speak to you my sound reaches you with that speed 

i produce a certain frequency here 

a certain number of oscillations per second 

they reach you 

your eardrum starts to oscillate with the same frequency 

and you hear that tone 

i have here a tuning fork 

which oscillates  times per second 

 tuning fork  mediumpitched   

your eardrum oscillates  times per second 

you hear this tone 

here i have  oscillations per second 

 metal rod emits lower   


your eardrum is now shaking 

going back and forth  times per second 

if you stay where you are and you dont move 

and i move these tuning forks 

you will hear a different frequency 

and thats what we call doppler effect 

if my sound source approaches you 

you will hear a frequency f prime which is larger 

than the frequency of the tuning fork 

if it moves away from you which i will call receding 

then f prime equals lower lower frequency 

for instance i move to you a sound source 

i call that a transmitter 

with a speed of about one meters per second 

transmitter is the sound transmitter 

then if it approaches you here you will hear f prime 

which is  times f 

this three here is the one part out of  

that you get an increase in frequency 

if i move it away from you then f prime would be 

 times the frequency of the source itself 


you stay where you are 

i have here a tuning fork which generates  hertz 

a very high frequency 

if i move it to you with the speed of one meter per second 

which i can do then you get an increase in pitch of  

that makes it  hertz 

and when i move it away from you there is a decrease of  

and you can clearly hear that difference 

i will first make you listen to the  hertz 

without my moving 

 tuning fork  very high pitched   

can you hear it very high frequency 

is it painful really 

high frequency 

most of you are young enough 


you should be able to hear  hertz 

okay now i am going to move it to you one meter per second 

and away from you 

 high tone goes up and  slightly in   

did you hear it once more 

 tone goes up and  quickly   

 class   

when it comes to you its clear that the frequency goes up 

and when it moves away from you the frequency is down 

now imagine that im going to rotate the sound source 


around in a circle 

now the sound that you receive the frequency that you receive 

will change in a sinusoidal fashion 

if this is that circle and this is the radius of that circle 

and if you are here in the plane of the circle 

then when the source comes straight to you 

with the velocity v lets say its a uniform circular motion 

f prime will be larger than f 

and it will in this case reach a maximum 

when it is at  degrees relative to you 

i dont have to give it a vector notation 

f prime equals f 

when it moves away from you f prime is smaller than f 

you hear a minimum 

and when it is here again 

when the angle between the velocity and your direction 

is again  degrees then f prime equals f again 

and so this phenomenon is called the doppler effect 

so if i twirl it around 

you will hear a sinusoidal fluctuation in f prime 

suppose i plot as a function of time f prime 

the way you will receive it you sit still 

but im going to move the sound source around like this 


then you will have a curve that looks something like 

some sinusoidalcosinusoidal fluctuation of f prime 

this will be the value f 

produced by the sound source itself 

this will be f prime maximum and this will be f prime minimum 

if you could record this there is an amazing number of things 

that you can deduce from this curve 

first of all you can take 

you can measure f prime max divided by f 

because you see this curve so you know what f is here 


you see what f prime max is 

and that should allow you to retrieve immediately 

v velocity of the transmitter 

if that number were  then you know 

that the speed in the orbit was one meter per second 

so this ratio immediately gives you the transmitter velocity 

this time separation gives you immediately 

the period of rotation 

but since two pi r if r is the radius 

divided by the velocity of the transmitter 


since that is the oh i can reverse it it doesnt matter 

two pi r divided by the time to go around 

is the velocity of the transmitter 

since you know the velocity of the transmitter from this ratio 

since you know the period which is this 

you now also find the radius r 

so from that curve and keep that with you 


because its going to be important in what follows 

we can derive three 

the radius the period of rotation 

and the speed of the object as i twirl it around 

i have here what we call a wind organ 

when i twirl this around it produces a particular tone 

we will talk later about  

why it produces a particular tone 

sometimes you hear two tones 

ill try to make you hear only one 

and as i swirl it around the sound is coming 

the sound source the transmitter is coming to you 

this when it goes like this its degree angle 

so you should not hear any doppler shift 

when it is here its moved away from you 

and so you hear a sinusoidal change in f prime 

try to hear that 

 wind organ producing  that changes   

can you hear when its coming to you that its higherpitched 


than when its going away from you 

can you hear that 

just say no if you dont hear it 

not very clear 

 wind organ again  varying   

for me its impossible to hear 

because im standing right under it of course 

well i tried 



i now want to change to electromagnetic waves 

electromagnetic waves travel with the speed of light 

which is  kilometers per second 

and if you want to treat that correctly 

you would have to use special relativity 

in the case of sound i stressed repeatedly 

that you in the audience should not move 

but that the sound source is moving 

in the case of electromagnetic radiation 

when you deal with the speed of light 

you dont have to ask that question 

it is a meaningless question in special relativity 

to ask whether you are moving relative to me 

or whether i am moving relative to you it doesnt matter 

all that matters in special relativity 

is the relative motion 

so you can always think of yourself as standing still 

and make the source of electromagnetic radiation 

move to you or away from you relative to you 


electromagnetic radiation is optical light infrared 

ultraviolet radio xrays gamma rays 

all of that is electromagnetic radiation 

if the velocity of the source of electromagnetic radiation 

the transmitter 

if that is way way smaller than the speed of light 

then it is very easy to predict 

the change in frequency due to doppler shift 

let this be the transmitter which produces frequency f 

and here is the receiver which receives the frequency f prime 

and let the velocity 

of the source of electromagnetic radiation be v 

i could put transmitter here but we can drop that index 

and let this angle be theta 

then this is the component in your direction 

we call that the radial component 

which is v cosine theta 

so i delete the tr 

this is just the velocity of the source 

relative to you at that angle 



if now we want to know what f prime is 

then f prime equals f times one plus v over c 

times the cosine of theta 

what matters is only the radial component of the velocity 

this is the radial component 


if theta is  degrees just like we had with sound 

then f prime equals f 

so  degrees the cosine of theta is zero 

f prime equals f 

if theta is smaller than  degrees 

then its coming towards you 

then f prime equals larger than f 

if theta equals larger than  degrees 

its going away from you 

then f prime equals smaller than f 



you would get a similar equation for sound 

by replacing this c by the speed of sound 

but i want to stress 


that this only holds for electromagnetic radiation 

if v over c is much much smaller than one 



now when we deal with sound 

there is something mechanically oscillating 

something is vibrating 

with electromagnetic radiation charges are vibrating 

electrons are vibrating 

and they are vibrating with a certain frequency 

and that means 

there is a certain period of one oscillation 

and that period of one oscillation is of course 

one over the frequency 

i can ask myself now the question 

how far does electromagnetic radiation 

how far does light travel in the time of one period capital t 

well it goes with the speed of light 

so in t seconds it moves a distance ct 

and that distance we call 

the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation 


lambda equals ct for which you can also write c divided by f 

so this is the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation 

the speed of light  kilometers per second 

the period of one oscillation say of the electrons 

and this is the frequency which you can give in hertz 

i could give you a specific example 

i for instance can take a period t 

of two times ten to the minus  seconds 

that would give me a wavelength 

of about six times ten to the minus seven meters 

six times ten to the minus seven meters 

and that you would experience as red light 

if i make the period shorter 

say  times ten to the minus  seconds 


i get a shorter wavelength 

i get four times ten to the minus seven meters 

and you would experience that as blue light 



in astronomy in optical astronomy 

we cannot measure the period or the frequency of optical light 

all we can measure is the wavelength 

and so if i want to use this equation 

then i have to replace f prime by c divided by lambda prime 

and f i have to replace by c divided by lambda 

and when i do that i get the following result 

i get lambda prime equals lambda 

times one minus v over c cosine theta 

if this is a plus this is a minus 

check that for yourself 

you have to use the small number approximation 

the taylor expansion 

namely that v over c is much much smaller than one 

so you can see now if the object comes to you 

in other words if f prime is larger than f 

if the frequency is higher then the wavelength will be smaller 

and so let me write that down 

when the cosine of theta so the object is coming to you 


when the cosine of theta is larger than zero 

the object is approaching you 

then the wavelength lambda prime will be less than lambda 

and that has a name we call that blue shift 

and the reason why we call that blue shift is 

that if the wavelengths become shorter 

it moves towards the blue end of the spectrum 

because blue has a lower wavelength than red 

if cosine theta is negative 

then the object is receding from you 

then lambda prime is larger than lambda 


and we call that red shift 

these are the terms that astronomers use all the time 

when you make a spectrum of a star 

you can do that using prisms or by other means 

and you look at the light intensity 

as a function of wavelength 

so here is the light intensity as a function of wavelength 

then you may expect to see some kind of a continuum 

but in fact what you do see is 

superimposed on a continuum 

you see sometimes very sharp absorption lines 

black missing light called absorption lines 

and these absorption lines correspond 

to elements in the atmosphere of the star 

in fact if you see the absorption lines you can tell 

what kind of elements are present in the star 

some are very characteristic absorption 

some for hydrogen some for calcium some for silicon 

some for magnesium and so on 

its actually interesting 

that when you look at the spectrum of the sun 

when people did that first 

when they had the means of doing that 

they found absorption lines in the spectrum of the sun 

which could not be identified 

they had never been seen here on earth these lines 

and so they called these lines after the sun 


the sun is helios and so they called it helium 

so helium was first discovered on the sun 

before it was later discovered on earth 

by looking at the absorption lines of the solar spectrum 

if a star moves to you then all the lines 

every single line will be blueshifted 

and if the star moves away from you 

all the lines will be redshifted 

if you take an 

with lambda prime divided by lambda 

and you pick any one of those lines 


it doesnt matter which you pick 

because they will all do exactly the same 

if this were for instance  

i just pick a very nice number 

that means lambda prime as you see is larger than lambda 

the wavelengths get longer so we have a red shift 

and you substitute that in that equation 

then youll find that the velocity 

at which that star is moving relative to you 

that gives you immediately the answer there 

equals minus  times the speed of light c 

and that is minus  kilometers per second 

and the minus then reminds you 

that the object is receding from you 

so that gives you a red shift 



i just wrote down 

that the velocity v is minus  kilometers per second 

its of course v cosine theta 

that is minus  kilometers per second 

its the radiali velocity thats all you can measure 


you have no information on theta 

so it is this component v cosine theta 

which we call the radial velocity 

that is minus  kilometers per second 



half of all the stars in the sky are binaries 

and so when you look at the spectra 

you will see them go around each other 

and so you in principle can measure the red shifts 

and the blue shifts as they go around each other 

you see doppler effect 

if they come to you you see blue shift 


if they go away from you you see red shift 

so in principle 

you can determine for each one of those stars 

the velocity in orbit the radius of their orbit 

and of course the period of the binary system 

so its an extremely powerful tool in astronomy 

if you have a binary system when the stars exactly do this 

to determine 

all these quantities that you would like to know 

i first would like to show you now some slides 



the first slide oh i have to lower the screen by the way 

that would help wouldnt it 

 chucklesi  

the first slide is a spectrum made in the laboratory 

of hydrogen helium and calcium and sodium 

it shows you emission lines no absorption lines 

these lines are produced by lamps 

and the frequencies are very well known 

here you see the famous sodium yellow lines 

so here is the red part of the spectrum 

and there is the blue part of the spectrum 



so we know these frequencies 

we know these wavelengths very well 

and here you see the spectrum of the sun 

with all these absorption lines that i mentioned to you 

its plastered with absorption lines 

and each of them can be identified 

these are due to calcium iron hydrogen and so on 

here is the blue part of the spectrum 


here is the green part the green part 

and here is the red part of the spectrum 



and here you see the basic idea behind a binary system 

suppose you have a binary system 

that only one star is visible and the other one is invisible 

and the one star shows you three clear absorption lines 

then as the star moves around the center of mass 

you see that all these lines drift in unison 

and out of this information 

you get the radius the velocity and the period 

assuming that you are on earth 

in the plane of the orbit of the stars 

if you have a binary system whereby both stars are visible 

so you get the spectrum of both stars 

then you see the doppler shift of both stars in the spectrum 

here we have a simple case 

that we only have two absorption lines not to confuse the issue 

and so in one in the case of one star 

the shift will be towards the left of the two lines 

but the other star the shift will be to the right 

because if you have a binary system 

when one star comes to you 

the other star goes away from you and vice versa 

so now you are very lucky now you have an ideal situation 


that you can find for both stars the radius of the orbit 

the velocity in orbit and the period for each star 

which of course is the same for both 



and here you see real data 

you see here first of all 

the emission lines which are measured in the laboratory 

that i just showed you 

they are always done simultaneously 

with the measurements 

you always must be sure 

that you have a good calibration of your wavelength 


and this spectrum a the top spectrum is of a star 

a binary system that has a period of  days 

and you see here single lines if you have good eyes 

that means at this very moment 

both stars move relative to you at angles of  degrees 

so you dont see any doppler shift 

but now look here 

later in time you see that this line has split in two lines 


and this one has also split in two lines 

clearly one component is coming to you 

and the other component is moving away from you 

and so you get all this useful information in astronomy 

by making the doppler shift measurements of binary systems 



i want to pursue the idea of binary stars 

they give us 

not only the information that we want regarding the orbits 

but there is even more that we can get out of it 

which is even more exciting 

so i will remind you what a binary system looks like 



remember the second exam 

im sure you will never forget that second exam 

and maybe never forgive me for that 



binary star one radius r mass m velocity v 

and star two going about their common center of mass 

mass m radius r and velocity v 

m r equals m r 

thats the way the center of mass is defined 

imagine that you as an observer 

are somewhere in the plane of this orbit and you are here 

and you are observing the system going around 

keplers third law which you derived on your exam 

as well as on an the period squared equals 

four pi squared times r plus r to the power three 

divided by g times m plus m 

let me check that to make sure i have that right 

yes that is correct 

imagine now you can make 

the doppler shift measurements of both stars 

you make the doppler shift measurement of star number one 

so you measure lambda one prime as a function of time 

out of that pops immediately the period of rotation 

out of that pops the velocity as we discussed 

out of that pops the radius r 

and now you measure 

the doppler shift of star two as a function of time 

out of that pops the period 

which of course better be the same 


out of that pops its velocity in orbit 

and out of it pops its radius 

all these things come out of the doppler shift measurements 

but if you know r and you know r 

then you also know r plus r 

so you know this part in keplers third law 

since you also know the periods you can find what m plus m is 

so now you get an extra bonus 

you know now what the sum of the mass of the two stars is 

in the binary system but you also know that m r is m r 

so now you have two equations 

you know what m plus m is 

and you know this equation and you can solve for m and m 


which is an amazing thing when you come to think of it 

so we finally end up 

with the mass of star one and the mass of star two 

all this comes out of doppler shift 

the velocities the radii the periods 

and even the masses of these objects 

now if you as an observer on earth 

are not exactly in the plane of the orbit 

then the situation is a little bit more complicated 

and i will not discuss that here today 

because in principle 

it doesnt affect the idea behind doppler shift 

but for astronomers it is very important 

its really a nuisance 

but i will not discuss that in any detail 

i want to discuss a fascinating application 

that we have in xray astronomy 

namely we have xray binaries 



what is an xray binary 

well it is a binary system 

this is a star not unlike our sun 

it has as certain mass has a certain radius 

and it is in orbit lets say with a neutron star 

even though it could be a black hole 

but for now lets just assume it is a neutron star 

and if these two masses are the same 

which i only use for the sake of simplicity 

in practice they could be very different 

then there is a point between these two right in the middle 

whereby the gravitational pull in one direction is the same 

as the gravitational pull in the other direction 

and we call that the inner lagrangian point 

in other words if you were there 

the neutron star would pull at you 

with exactly the same force as the other star 

so you wouldnt know where to go 

if this inner legrangian point lies 

below the surface of this star that means 

if the stars are a little closer than i have drawn them here 

then the matter of this star will fall 

towards the neutron star 

because the pull in this direction is then larger 

than the pull in this direction 

now of course this system is a binary system 

they go around in the plane of the blackboard say 


and so this matter cannot fall radially in 

but it will fall in and spiral in 

and forms what we call an accretion disk 

around the neutron star 

this is called the accretor and this is called the donor 

there is mass transfer from the donor to the neutron star 

oops i just noticed i misspelled the word accretion 

there is an r in accretion 

and as that occurs 

there is a tremendous amount of energy that is released 

i want to blow up the neutron star 

very simple  considerations now 

what comes is extremely pedestrian 

this is the mass of the neutron star 

and this is the radius of the neutron star 

and i take a little bit of matter m 

and i drop it from a large distance onto the neutron star 

at what speed 

will that little piece of matter reach the neutron star 

you should almost be able to close your eyes 

and give me that answer right now 

the kinetic energy when it reaches the neutron star 

equals onehalf m v squared 

that is the speed 

at which it will crash onto the neutron star 

and that must be 

mm neutron star g divided by the radius of the neutron star 

you always lose your m and so you find 

that the speed at which it reaches the neutron star 

is the square root of two m neutron star 

times g divided by r neutron star 

you should remember this equation 

this was the equation that we had for escape velocity 

if you were here and you go back to infinity 

you reach exactly that speed so if you fall in from infinity 

that is exactly the speed 

at which you reach the neutron star 


it should obviously be the same number 

and you dont really have to be infinitely far away 

you just have to be much further away 

than the radius of the neutron star 

when this matter crashes onto the neutron star 

the kinetic energy that is released is onehalf mv squared 

it is converted to heat and to give you some feeling 

for the incredible power of a neutron star 

if you make this little m as little as ten grams 


think of it as a pretty fullsized marshmallow 

and you throw a marshmallow 

from a large distance onto a neutron star 

the energy that is released is comparable 

to the atomic bomb that was used on hiroshima 

a tengram object thrown onto a neutron star 

the reason being that this velocity 

becomes enormously high 

if you put in for the neutron star 

a mass of about three times ten to the th kilograms 

and you take for the radius of the neutron star 


about ten kilometers 

you will find that that velocity becomes 

about two times ten to the eighth meters per second 

which is about  of the speed of light 

and because of this enormousi speed 

onehalf mv squared is horrendously high 

it is a conversion 

of gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy 

and then ultimately to heat 

now nature is transferring mass at an extraordinarily high rate 

in many of these binary systems 

there are at least some hundred or so that we know 

in our own galaxy 

the mass transfer rate which i call dmdt 

so that is the transfer rate 

from the donor onto the neutron star 

that transfer rate 

is roughly ten to the th kilograms per second 


it is a horrendousi mass transfer rate 

you can calculate 

by multiplying it with onehalf v squared 

how many joules per second are released 

in the form of kinetic energy 

that means in the form of heat 

and i call that the power of that neutron star 

and that then for this mass transfer rate 

thats about two times ten to the th joules per second 

which is watts 

and that is about  times larger 


than the power of our own sun 

but the temperature of this neutron star 

because of this enormous amount of energy released 

the temperature would reach values 

of about ten million degrees kelvin 

and at that high temperature 

the neutron star would emit almost exclusively xrays 

you and i are very cold bodies only  degrees kelvin 

we radiate electromagnetic radiation 

in the infrared part of the spectrum 

we have warm bodies 

when you hold someone in your arms you can feel that 

if i would heat you up to  degrees kelvin 

you would become redhot 

and you actually 

we could turn the light off and i would see you 

youre just emitting red light 

if i would heat you up to three million degrees 

you would start to begin to radiate in xrays 

you may not like it but thats a detail of course 

so i want you to appreciate the fact that the 

the kind of radiation that you get depends strongly 

on the temperature and at ten million degrees 


youre dealing almost exclusively with xrays 



so these binary systems are very potent sources of xrays 

the neutron stars rotate around we discussed that earlier 

conservation of angular momentum 

and they have strong magnetic fields 

the matter that falls onto the neutron star 

already heats up during the infall 

because there is gravitational potential energy released 

and so the matter is so hot 

that in general its highly ionized 

and highly ionized material cannot reach 

a magnetic neutron star 

in all locations that it prefers to do so 

in  you will learn why thats the case 

however the matter can reach 

the neutron star at the magnetic poles 

and so what youre going to see now is 

youre going to have a neutron star with magnetic poles 

so the matter streams in onto the magnetic poles 

which gives you two hot spots 

and if the axis of rotation doesnt coincide 

with the line through the two hot spots 

if the neutron star rotates 

youre going to see xray pulsations 

when the hot spot is here you will see xrays 

and when the hot spot is here you will not see xrays 


and so we observe from these systems xray pulsations 

now think of the following 

the xray pulsations are a clock 

it is the clock of the rotating neutron star 

if the neutron star in a binary system 

because all of these are in a binary system 

these xray binaries 

if its coming to you you see doppler shift 

the ticks of the clock come a little closer together 


if the neutron star moves away from you 

the ticks of the clocks are a little bit further apart 

that is exactly what doppler shift is all about 

so by timing the pulses of the xrays 

you can get a handle 

on the doppler shift of the neutron star 

that means you can get the speed of the neutron star 

you can get the radius of the orbit 

and you can get the period just like we discussed before 


but now you take an optical 

the xray observations by the way have to be made 

from outside the earths atmosphere 

because xrays are absorbed by the earths atmosphere 

now you take an optical telescope 

and you look from the ground 

and now you see the optical spectrum of the donor 

and what do you see in the donor 

you see these absorption lines 

and as the donor moves around the center of mass 

these absorption lines move back and forth 

the doppler shift of the donor 

so you know the velocity of the donor 

you know the radius of the donor 

not the radius of the donor 

you know the radius of the orbit and you know the period 

so now we have a situation that i just described earlier 


that you have the doppler shift of both objects 

and remember i told you that you also get the masses 

you get the mass of the donor and the mass of the accretor 



before i go ahead let me show you some slides 

so we have to lower this again if thats possible yep 



i want to show you 

an artists conception of such a binary system 




so this is what it may look like 

you see the donor there 

and you see the neutron star right here 

so small of course that its invisible 

and this is the accretion disk 

swirls in the matter ends up on the neutron star 

and this is another view that gives you an idea of the donor 

and then the swirl of matter 

and then it swirls in and ends up here on the neutron star 


and here you see data that were obtained in  

its clear evidence for the existence 

of these rotating neutron stars with these xray hot spots 

you see here the observed xray intensity as a function of time 

and the actual data are these very thin lines 

and this bold line was drawn over by the authors 

to convince you that you see a signal which is highly periodic 

the time from here to here is  seconds 

this object was called hercules x 

so this is one of the magnetic poles 

and this is the other magnetic pole 

one magnetic pole and the other magnetic pole 

so you see here unmistakably the rotation of the neutron star 

and the xray pulsations 

here you see data from the same object 

but now the time scale is very different 

from here to here is one day 

this is two days 

and when you look at this data alone forget this for now 

notice that you see the source is active in xrays 

the second oscillations 

you cannot see of course anymore 

because the time scale is different 

but notice here there are no xrays at 

 days later no xrays at all 


 days later no xrays at all 

and so what youre looking at here 

are what we call xray eclipses 

when the neutron star moves behind the donor star 

all the xrays are absorbed by the donor star 

and you get xray eclipses 

in other words you get 

independently from the doppler shift 

you also get the period of the orbit by the xray eclipses 

and this really changed our whole concept of astronomy 

the existence of these neutron star binaries 

and now comes a part what are the masses of these objects 


i already alluded you to the idea 

of the possibility that there may be black holes 

all the mass measurements that have been done to date 

of these neutron stars where you see the pulsations 

all of them are very close to  solar mass 

and theres a good reason for that thats not an accident 

in  the physicist chandrasekhar predicted 

that white dwarfs could not exist 

if their mass is larger than  solar mass 

it was a quantum mechanical calculation 

for which he received in  the nobel prize 

remember we discussed white dwarfs earlier 

a white dwarf has about a radius of  kilometers 

about the same as the earth 

and imagine that you have a white dwarf 

and you add matter to the white dwarf 

and you pass the solarmass mark 

then the white dwarf will collapse 

and becomes a neutron star 

and so when we measure the masses of neutron stars 

it turns out maybe somewhat by surprise 


that theyre all very close to  

if you could add more matter to the neutron star 

by accreting more and more matter 

and you reach the point that the neutron star becomes 

as massive as three times the mass of the sun 

we believe that the neutron star can no longer support itself 

and becomes a black hole 

and so now comes the question what is a black hole 

a black hole is the most bizarre object that you can imagine 

and it is something 

that you want to stay away from too 


a black hole has no size unlike a neutron star 

it has no size but it does have mass and it has a lot of mass 

three times the mass of the sun ten times the mass of the sun 

a hundred times the mass of the sun 

so it has mass but it has no size 

we identify around the black hole a sphere with radius r 


which we call the event horizon 



imagine you are at the event horizon 

and you want to get away from the black hole 

what kind of speed do you need 

you should be able to give me that answer immediately 

the escape velocity must be 

 mg divided by the radius of that event horizon 

in other words the radius of the event horizon itself 

equals  mg divided by c squared 

if you tell me what m is 

i will tell you what the radius of the event horizon is 



i went a little fast here 

i skipped an important step 

v is the escape velocity from the event horizon 

which is at a distance capital r from the mass m 

so we see that here 

now this escape velocity can never be larger 

than the speed of light so the maximum value possible is c 

and if now you look at this part of this equation 

and you take the radius on one side 

youll get that the radius of the event horizon 

equals  mg divided by c squared 

and thats how i found that equation 

sorry that i went a little too fast 



if m is the mass of the earth 

the radius of the event horizon is one centimeter 

if m is the mass of the sun 

the radius of the event horizon is three kilometers 

if m is three times the mass of the sun 

the radius of the event horizon would become ten kilometers 


it scales linearly with the mass 

if you were inside the event horizon 

you could never escape the black hole 

because you would need 

a speed which is larger than the speed of light 

therefore you can never escape from inside the event horizon 

nothing can get out of it 

not xrays no radio emission no light nothing 

once youre inside the event horizon youve had it 

you cannot escape it 

and so the question now that comes 

can we see xrays from a black hole 


because if nothing can come out of a black hole 

how can we see xrays 

and the answer is yes we can 

because as long as the matter that swirls in 

is outside the event horizon it would still be very hot 

because gravitational potential energy 

would already have been released it would be very hot 

and it would emit xrays 

so we can see xrays outside a black hole 

however you will never see pulsations 

because a black hole has no surface like a neutron star 

so theres no such thing 

as two hot spots which rotate around 

and so now comes the problem for 

how can you determine the mass of the accretor 


if the accretor is not a pulsating neutron star 

but if the accretor is a black hole 

well you can only now measure the doppler shift of the donor 

because the donor in general is quite well visible 

its an optical star 

but you will not be able to measure 

the doppler shift of the black hole no pulsations 

if however an astronomer can make an estimate 

of the mass of that donor 

then you will find the mass of the accretor 

in other words instead of having 

the doppler shift measurements of both stars 

the neutron star and the donor star 

which gives you the mass of two stars 

now you have to settle for the doppler shift of only the donor 

and the mass of the donor itself 

and if you have a reasonable idea of what that mass will be 

then you can find the mass of the accretor 

and there is a very famous case 

that was the first one discovered in the early s 

which is called cygnus x 

cygnus x is an xray binary 

which has an orbital period of  days 

the doppler shift measurements of the donor were made 

and astronomers simply looking at the spectrum 

at the absorption lines 

and the structure of the absorption lines 

and the kind of absorption lines 

were able to say yeah the mass of the donor 

is probably approximately  solar masses 

and with that information and with the doppler shift 

you can now arrive at the mass of the accretor 

and that is in this case 

oh by the way 

there is an r missing in the word accretion there 

that mass turns out to be about  solar masses 



now when this was found in the early s 

most people concluded this has to be a black hole 

it is a very compact object 

otherwise it wouldnt emit xrays in the first place 

and clearly if the mass of that compact object 

is way larger than three solar masses 

then there is no doubt in our minds that this is a black hole 

since that time 

many black hole xray binaries have been discovered 

so if i summarize the amazing thing is 

from studying the doppler shift 

of binary systems like xray binaries 

you can derive the orbital parameters orbital radius 


orbital periods the speed of the stars in orbit 

but you can also find the masses 

and whenever you make a measurement of the mass 

when it is a neutron star 

when you see the xray pulsations 

you almost always find 

that it is very close to  times the mass of the sun 

but in a few cases you will find 

that the mass is substantially larger 

admittedly you have to do without the doppler shift then 

of the accretor but you have to use some other information 

and then you can conclude in most cases 

with pretty good confidence 

that youre dealing with something like 

bizarre as a black hole 


which you can only define the event horizon 

and you can never escape a black hole 

when youre inside the event horizon 

because that is when the escape velocity 

would be larger than the speed of light 

so this is the escape velocity 

if you set that equal to c 

then you can solve for the radius of the event horizon 

and out of it pops this equation 

i would like to show you now a slide of cygnus x 

which is the oldest known black hole xray binary 



i have to lower the screen 



and there it comes 



this was really a bombshell when this was discovered 

i still remember reading that first publication 

two people discovered this independently by the way 

they came independently to the same conclusion 

tom bolton and it was paul merlin 

two independent groups
