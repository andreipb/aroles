Description
Professor Freeman discusses the mounting tensions between the colonists and 
the British in the late 1760s and early 1770s. The Virginia Resolves were 
published and read throughout the colonies in 1765, and generated discussion 
about colonial rights and liberties. Colonies began working together to resolve 
their problems, and formed the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. Meanwhile, Boston was 
becoming more radicalized and mobs began acting out their frustration with British 
policies. Colonists began to believe that the British were conspiring to oppress 
their liberties, a belief that seemed to be confirmed when the British stationed 
troops in Boston. The mounting tension between the Bostonians and British troops 
culminated in the violence of the Boston Massacre in March 1770.
