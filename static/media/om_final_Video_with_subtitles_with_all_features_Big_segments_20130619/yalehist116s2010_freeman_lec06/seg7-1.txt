tuesday we ended with the angry response in  

colonies to the passage of the stamp act  

i talked abouti described patrick henry 

we had a firstour famous revolution moment number one 

patrick henry speaking out in the virginia house of burgesses 

talking about what he dramatically called his colonys 

dying liberty and at the very end of the 

lecture i mentioned that in may of  

the virginia house of burgesses passed some protesting 

resolutions ultimately known as the virginia resolves 

i think i said resolutions on tuesday and lets stick with 

resolves the virginia resolves 

and the virginia resolves saidthere were a number of 

different obviouslyresolves in the virginia resolves 

they said that the colonists had come to virginia with equal 

rights to all british subjects that the colonial charter 

confirmed that that virginians had the right 

to be governed by their own legislature 

and that the virginia legislature had never forfeited 

its right to impose taxes on the colony of virginia 

ill repeat that again 

the virginia resolves may colonists had come to 

virginia with equal rights to all british subjects 

colonial charters confirmed that 

virginians had the right to be governed by their own colonial 

legislature and the virginia colonial 

legislature had not forfeited its right to impose taxes on the 


colony of virginia 

now the house of burgesses passes these resolutions 

but in virginia they werent even published in the local 

newspaper 

however they were published in rhode island 

okay 

i really dont make this up 

i feel like youre going to accuse me of planting rhode 

island randomly throughout this course and im not 

itsreally its there all by itself 

rhode islandand why rhode island i cant tell youbut 

indeed by happenstance someone in rhode islandit 

circulates 

the resolves are circulating 

people are reading them and theyre talking about them 

but its somebody in rhode island who publishes the 

virginia resolves in a rhode island newspaper 

however what this person does when he publishes these resolves 


is not only publish the ones that were actually passed 

but there are two additional resolves that get published 

right alongside the ones that were passed 

these were not passed and possibly werent really even 

discussed and theyre more radical than the other 

resolutions 

but theyre put right alongside with no differentiation 

and these two unpassed more radical resolutions say 

quote his majestys liege people 

inhabitants of this colony are not bound to yield 

obedience to any law or ordinance whatsoever designed to 

impose any taxation upon them 

okay 


thats a much bolder statement than what i just said was 

happening in those virginia resolves 

and then the sort of more radical unpassed resolution 

number two that got published said 

that anyone who asserted that anyone except the virginia 

assembly could directly tax virginia was 

quote an enemy of this his majestys colony 

okay 

those are two really strong statements 

the virginia house of burgesses did not pass those 


did not resolve those but they get published in rhode 

island right alongside the ones that were passed and resolved 

and so they go circulating throughout the colonies 

making virginia look a lot more radical than it was at that 

particular moment 

so news of this sort of new radical version of the virginia 

resolves gets spread throughout the colonies and colonies are 

then inspired to pass resolves of their own 

so its another rhode island moment 

however it is massachusetts that first suggests united 


colonial action 

so in june of  the massachusetts assembly 

sends a circular letter to all of the colonial assemblies 

and a circular letter is kind of what it sounds like 

a letter intended to circulateto all of the 

colonial assemblies inviting them to meet in a congress in 

new york in october of  quote to consider of a 

general and united dutiful loyal and humble 

representation of their condition to his majesty and the 

parliament and to implore relief 

okay 

so its a united response but its also dutiful 

loyal and humble so on the one hand the fact 

that theres going to be some kind of a united colonial 

statement is interesting and forceful 

but on the other hand dutiful loyal 

humble 

were not  were not here declaring independence here 

were just kind of imploring relief making a statement that 

excuse we are your humble and obedient subjects and we 

dont really like this thank you very much 

so its that kind of a statement 

nine colonies responded 

new hampshire declined to participate 

virginia north carolina and georgia couldnt participate 

because their governors didnt convene their assemblies to 

elect delegates so there were no delegates 


elected but all in all there were 

twentyseven men who took part in what came to be known as the 

stamp act congress 

right 

easy enough to remember the stamp act congress 

which met for much of october in  

okay the stamp act congress 

the stamp act congress was actually the first of what were 

going to see is a series of extralegal organizations created 

outside of the regular colonial political system to resist and 

reform british policies  and so its a significant 

action on the part of the colonies 

and ultimately the stamp act congress passed a 

series of declarations and they kind of echo some of 

the resolutions and declarations that had been circulating and 

theyre going to sound not drastically different from some 

of the logic that ive been talking about in the last 

lecture or two 

and ill just mention four of the resolutions passed by the 


stamp act congress 

they declared that they owed their allegiance to the crown 

like any british subject they declared that they were 

entitled to the rights and liberties of any british 

subject they said that british subjects 

in the colonies could not be taxed without their consent 

and they declared that trial by jury was the right of every 

british subject in the colonies 

so you can see theirreally their statement is saying well 

were british subjects like any other british subject and were 

demanding the rights and liberties of other british 

subjects 

now its important to notethe resolutions are not saying that 

parliament had no right to regulate trade in the colonies 


theyre just saying that parliament cannot directly tax 

the colonies without their consent 

so again its a direct statement its a strong 

statement but its a respectful statement 

and its not boldly sort of altering 

at least in the minds of the colonists 

an enormous change of policy 

theyre kind of stating what they think the state of things 

is 

so clearly the stamp act congress is a step toward 

colonial unity its a significant step 


now actually i want to add at this point the answer to a 

question that someone asked at the end of class on tuesday 

and hes lurking over there 

i think that was you  yes 

inaudible it was a really good question 

i answer questionsand then i actually answer them in class 

it was a really good question and the question was did anyone 

in parliament actually oppose the stamp act and if they did 

what was the logic 

its actually a really good question and although i knew the 

answer was yes i couldnt tell you very much 

detail about that yes so i went and did a little 

research and its interesting 

most members of parliament assumed that the stamp act was 

i suppose you could say constitutional 

or that it was aboveboard proper 

that there was nothing wrong with it as far as procedurally
