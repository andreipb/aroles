another civilian said something insulting to another soldier and 

they began punching each other and there was another street 

fight and that would be the first in 

a series of increasingly agitated clashes on that day 

march th  thats going to end in 

gunfire 

but obviously the boston massacre is not the first moment 

of conflict 

now later that eveningtheres a series of little outbursts 

that day march th 

later that evening a small boy walking out on the street began 

taunting a soldier and the soldier responded by 


knocking him down 

well the boy got up went off found some other 

colonists in the street and complained that a soldier over 

there had knocked him down 

okay 

so in this environment thats going to really get a lot of 

colonists upset 

so a little ring of people surrounds the kid 

hes knocking down a kid 

we need to go get the soldiers 

right 

so a small group of colonists heads off to the barracks to 


actually accost the soldiers but theyre held off by guards 

soon thereafter someone begins ringing the bell 

of the boston meeting house and normally when you ring the 

bell of the boston meeting house thats a signal for fire 

and fire is a serious thing in a place full of wooden 

buildings 

right 

so if the bell is ringing that means oh my god 

theres a fireand everyone does what they should do when 

theres an alarm of fire 

right 

the bell goes off and dozens and dozens and dozens of people 

run in to the street thinking that theres a fire 

now from this point we have several accounts 

there are a number of accounts about what happened 

some of them conflict and were going to be looking 

at two accounts today 

were going to be looking at one by british general thomas 

gage i mentioned before the commanderinchief of the 

british army in america 

hes posted in new york but he had gotten a very detailed 


report about what happened in boston from his soldiers 

his officers and menon exactly what they think they 

experienced 

and then the other account is by samuel adams 

radical propagandistclearly is going to be a very different 

point of view 

okay 

so gage sends a very detailed report to a member of the kings 

cabinet in london based on what the british soldiers in boston 


told him 

assuming that the colonists in general were insolent and were 

pushing to get more than they deserved 

gage says in his statement he suspects that the entire 

thing was deliberate 

he thinks that there were some colonists who probably 

prearranged what happened armed themselves with sticks 

rocks bricks and snowballs 

im sorry but snowballs just never sounds like a scary weapon 

to me even though bad things happen 

here and i know i would not like to 

be hit with a snowball but its not like a brick 

but snowballs areeveryones complaining about snowballs in 

these accounts youll see 

somehow it just makes it seem less serious 

i dont know why 

but anyway he thinks its deliberate 

he thinks the colonists prearranged it 

that they armed themselves with sticks rocks 

bricks and snowballs planned the ringing of the bell 


so that bostonians would rise up at the signal and attack the 

soldiers 

okay 

so this is what gage assumesand here is gages 

account 

many people came out of their houses supposing a fire in 

the town and several officers on the 

same supposition were repairing to their posts 

but meeting with mobs were reviled attacked 

and those who could not escape knocked down and treated with 

great inhumanity 

right 

those crude nasty colonists are treating 

the soldiers very badly 

different mobs paraded through the streets 

passing the several barracks and provoking the soldiers to 


come out 

one body went to the main guard where every provocation was 

given without effect for the guard remained quiet 

from thence the mob proceeded to a sentinel 

a single sentinel  posted upon the 

customhouse at a small distance from the 

guard and attacked him 

he defended himself as well as he could calling out for 

help 

okay 

theres one guy according to this account 

and the mob attacks the one guy standing in front of the customs 

house 

and people ran to the guard to give information of his 

danger 

so according to gage people see this one guy getting 

attacked by a bunch of people and they 

actually colonistsrun to get other soldiers to help the one 

guy 

so according to gages account theyre not all crazy radicals 

in boston 

some of them are out there helping us 

captain preston hearing the sentinel was in 

danger of being murderedalready 

we got to murder really fasthe detached a 

sergeant and  men to relieve him and soon after followed 

himself to prevent to prevent any rash act on the part of the 

troops 

this party as well as the sentinel was immediately 

attacked some colonists throwing bricks 

stones pieces of ice 

and snowballs once again the 

snowballsat them whilst others advanced up to their 


bayonets and endeavored to close with them to use their bludgeons 

and clubs calling out to them to fire if 

they dared and provoking them in a most opprobrious 

language 

right 

again  rude colonists behaving badly 

so we have a group of soldiers that are lined up in front of 

the customs house running to protect a fellow soldier 

supposedly being murdered at the hands of a crude and angry mob 

armed with sticks and rocks and snowballs 

okay lets segue over to adams 

adams writes a series of newspaper essays for the 

boston gazette describing the same  

often quoting testimony from the trial of the soldiers that 

obviously takes place after this incident 

but also obviously quoting them and telling the story with his 

own radical flair 

now remember here the different reasons for these accounts 

and this is actually a great example of the importance of 

thinking about the nature of historical evidence 

who things are written to and why theyre written has a 

lot to do with how you interpret  

right 

you have these two documents being written for really 

specific reasons to a very specific audience 

so gage is trying to explain to royal authorities a shooting 

that never should have happened 


he has to somehow justify this so hes appealing to the people 

he sent the letter to whoever this royal authority 

wasand he has to assume that other royal authorities are 

going to see it 

hes appealing to them as fellow sophisticated englishmen 

who understand the nature of things out in this sort of 

frontier colony area crude colonists 

upset colonists 

so in a sense gage is offering sort of an extreme version of 

some typical english sentiment amongabout the colonies 


adams is writing to the colonial public and hes trying 

to raise a public outcry against the soldiers and obviously by 

association against the british 

administration and clearly adams is going to 

want to depict these soldiers as cruel and tyrannical as all 

standing armies are so in a sense adams is 

certainly going to be offering an extreme version of some 

colonial sentiment at the time about the soldiers and maybe 

about the british administration generally 

okay 

so here is adams version from the moment when the bell starts 

to ring 

the ringing of the bells alarmed the town 

it being supposed by the people in general there was a fire 

as the people came in to the street the boy who had been 

knocked down told them that the sentry had knocked him 

down 

okay and im actually quoting so thisyou cant blame me for 

this 

the boy says a sentry knocked me down 

points at the solider and says theres the son of a 

bitch that knocked me down 

laughter i love that that detail is in 

the newspaper laughsand thats another one of those 

things that likethey said that in  

laughter and they did 

other people heard this and cried kill him 

laughter hey 

laughs the sentry ran to the 

customhouse steps knocked at the door 

but could not get in 

excuse me 

laughs theyre going to kill me 

he primed and loaded his gun and leveled it and told the 

people to stand off and called to the main guard 

various were the dispositions and inclinations of 

the people at this point 

the cooler sort advised to go the curious were 

willing to stay and see the event 

and those whose feelings were warmer 

perhaps partook of the boys resentment 

and here hes trying to justify likeokay there were some
