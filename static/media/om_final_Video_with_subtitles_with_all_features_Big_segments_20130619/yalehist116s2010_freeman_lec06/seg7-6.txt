crazy radical guys but they were probably upset with the 

boy 

right they werent angry 

they were justof course theyd be upset 

the boy was attacked 

the soldiers moved to help the sentry standing alone before the 

mob 

adams said the soldiers moved quote 

with an haughty air they pushd their bayonets and 

damnd the people as they went along 

and when they arrivd at their post 

one witness who is a young gentleman of a liberal education 


and an unspotted character laughter 

declared that one of the soldiers whom he particularly 

named loaded his gun 

pushed him with his bayonet and damnd him 

ooh okay 

laughter so here according to adams 

theres this rude imperious british soldier 

treating the young gentleman of a liberal education and 

unspotted character laughs like a lesser being 

okay 

so now both narrators have gotten us to the same point 

we have soldiers lined up 

they have just very visibly loaded their guns 

in front of them stands british captain preston withwho is in 

command of the menand in front of preston is an angry crowd 

so according to gage at this point preston 

soldiers behind himcrowd in front of him 

hes trying to calm the situation down 

and supposedly hes asked are you going to ask those 

soldiers to fire on us 

and preston says yeah 

see the guns are behind me and youre in front of me 


no really 

laughter it wouldnt be a good idea for 

them to fire now because ill die 

right 

laughter hes like no 

its a good point i think 

but all he could say had no effect and one of the 

soldiers receiving a violent blow instantly fired 

captain preston turned around to see who fired 

and received a blow upon his arm which was aimed at his 

head and the mob 

at first seeing no execution done and imagining the soldiers 


had only fired powder to frighten them 

grew more bold and attacked with greater violence 

continually striking at the soldiers and pelting them 

and calling out to them to fire 

and we have captain prestons description of what he heard 

from the crowd 

he says the crowd was yelling come on 

you rascals bloody backs 

lobster scoundrels 

laughs quite a little string of 

insults 

fire if you dare 

you dare not fire 

okay 

so gage goes on the soldiers at length 

perceiving their lives in danger 

and hearing the word fire all round them 

three or four of them fired one after another 

and again three more in the hurry and confusion 

four or five persons were unfortunately killedun 

fortunatelyand more wounded 

okay 

so thats basically the end of gages account 

clearly in his account the soldiers are under serious 


attack 

adams tells a different story 

adams says yes the crowd was yelling at the 

troops but they had insulted the crowd and loaded their guns 

yes they had sticks but everybody was carrying sticks 

these days because everyone was scared of the soldiers 

so everyone naturally walked around in the streets with 

sticks 

now maybe thats true which tells you a lot about the 

streets of boston or maybe its not in which case 

its really creative 

laughter yes the crowd hit at the 

soldiers guns but they were trying to push them away 

so adams says its not an uncontrolled mob 

its actually a group of people carrying their normal 

everyday sticks laughter 

pushing in to hear captain preston answer the question 

about whether or not he was going to order the troops to 

fire 

at this moment adams says one of the soldiers 

was hit by a stick staggered fired his gun at the 

crowd upon which several soldiers fired and says adams 

they reloaded their guns 

they were going to fire again 

some of the crowd moved away 

one man went up to a soldier and asked him to his face if he 

was going to fire and supposedly the soldier 


said quote yes by the eternal 

god at which point the colonists knocked him down 

laughter i love all the detail 

at this point preston called out to his men not to fire and 

they stopped and here adams says 

i am no soldier and never desired to be 

but i appeal to those who are whether the words 

dont fire are words of command in the british army 

and whether there is not some other word which soldiers are 


taught to understand more proper to be given on such 

an occasion  

which would have prevented such rashness 

so here hes saying the guy didnt even call out 

cease fire 

he said dont stop laughs great 

thank you captain preston 

and then adams describes the people who died 

he makes special note of the fact that grey 

the rope maker who insulted the sentry by asking him to clean 

the outhouse is killed in the clash 

coincidence or murder 

laughter adams is good 

right 

and so here adams is tossing out the suggestion that maybe 

the troops were just looking for an excuse to fire on the 

townspeople and then really get that nasty 

grey plotting maybe 

and the british too as youve heard 

are wondering if maybe this is a plot on the part of the 

colonists 

maybe theyre actually just trying to rob the customs house 

and this whole thing was an elaborate ploy by the colonists 


just to rob the customs house behind the guard 

so you can really see from these two accounts 

and from the details contained within them 

the animosity and the sense of alienation between the colonists 

and the soldiers on both sides and you can also see really 

dramatically the fears on both sides that theres some kind of 

a plot theres some kind of a plot of 

resistance or tyranny depending on which side youre 

on
