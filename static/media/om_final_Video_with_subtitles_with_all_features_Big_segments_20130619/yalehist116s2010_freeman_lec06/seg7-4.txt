of the british colonies  

now dickinson actuallywhen you read these 

hes pretty moderate in tone 

and most of what he does is he uses past precedent to argue 

against the right of parliament to directly tax the colonies 

he asserts were not talking about 

independence were just talking about past 

precedent 

however he also says and this is a quote from him 

we cannot be happy without being free 

we cannot be free without being secure in our property 

we cannot be secure in our property 

if without our consent others may 


as by right take it away 

that taxes imposed on us by parliament 

do thus take it away 

thats really clear direct logic 

right 

we cant be happy without being free 

we cant be free without being secure in our property 

we cant be secure in our property if without our consent 

others may take it away and parliament seems to be 

taking it away 

so dickinson isnt arguing anything amazingly new here 

but hes certainly stating it with real clarity and real 


power 

and he also appears to be saying well 

some of that stuff we learned from that whole stamp act thing 

i think they apply as well to this new townshend act thing 

he appears to be drawing a pattern 

so letters from a farmer in pennsylvania ultimately has 

an impact 

its a strong statement 

up in boston there was also some writing 

going on 

and there samuel adams who was in the massachusetts 

assembly wrote a circular letter that he sent to other 

colonies 

yet again another circular letter 

and this time its a circular letter protesting against the 

townshend acts and its moderate 

but its criticizing the acts 

it does denyitswere  this isnt about independence 

were not trying to rebel herebut it does urge joint 

colonial resistance to the townshend acts 

now back in england many people urged a lenient 

response to this 

if you think about it potentially 

its a scary thing 

you have this guythis radical guy in bostonwhos urging 

joint colonial resistance to an act of parliament 

so as you will see some people get rather upset by 

this but not everybody 

some people say well okay 


lets not overrespond lets not overreact 

however the british secretary of state lord hillsborough 

really saw this as organized resistance and refused to stand 

for it 

so in  privately consulting with the king 

so kind of doing this off on the side 

he instructed the governor of massachusetts to dissolve the 

massachusetts assembly unless they took back the letter 

he also sent a letter to all royal governors telling them to 

ignore the massachusetts letter or else he would dissolve their 

legislatures too 

okay 

thatstheres a strong statement for you thats clearly 

bound to make colonists get very very upset 

hillsborough also knowing that people are going 

to get upset urged general thomas 

gagewhos commanderinchief of the army and at the time was 

posted in new york he urges gage in new york to 

prepare his troops in case theyre needed in boston 

okay 

so hes anticipating there might be a response 

it would be nice to have troops potentially ready to go to 

boston 

so now troops are being organized 

theres threats about dissolving assemblies 

and communication between the colonies in the form of a 

circular letter is being discouraged 

so clearly if youre a colonist at this point 

there appears to be a plan of repression right 

a plan 

there seems to be a system of tyranny 

there seems to be some kind of organized attack on colonial 

liberties and im emphasizing plan and 

system and organized because next week thats the direction 

were going to be going with the lectures 

were going to be looking at what i call the logic of 

resistance orhow does all of this add up in the minds of the 

colonists 

whatswhat are they drawingwhat conclusions are 

they drawing based on actions that are happening 

and as well see in the lectures and in the readings for 


next week theres a lot of conclusions 

being drawn about an actual system of tyranny 

which is a very eighteenthcentury way of kind 

of looking at it 

so colonists are wondering if theres a sort of system of 

repression being put in place 

meanwhile parliament eventually in  

repeals most of the townshend acts but does preserve the tax 

on tea partly for revenue and partly 

to prove that they still have the right to tax the colonies 

so were halfseeing revenue raising and halfseeing an 

argument here 

and probably there was an assumption on the part of 


parliament that by repealing most of the acts things would 

quiet down but as events in boston were 

about to prove this would not be the case 

as were about to see between  and  

boston really ends up taking center stage 

and thanks in part to the actions of samuel adams who 

really is youll see todaya brilliant 

propagandist and a man with a really fierce sense of his 

rights his british rights and his 

grievances as an english subject 

and i will add that samuel adams did brew beer 

right 

he actually issamuel adams is associated with beer 

so truth in advertising though i have no idea if thats 

an accurate portrait of sam adams 

its paul  

sam adams is too ugly 

sam adams is too  

laughs oh poor sam adams 

i feel very bad now 

laughs oh 

well hes not attractive but i dont know if hes ugly 

i feel bad 

now im going to have to find a way to redeem sam adams in the 

laughs 

thank you very much 

no wonder i didnt think it was entirely an accurate 

portraitokay 


and yet he is associated with beer 

okay 

so sam adamshes going to have a moment 

october of  troops actually arrive in 

boston at the instigation of massachusetts royal governor 

francis bernard whos alarmed at the sort of 

radical rumblings that hes hearing 

parliament makes things worse byin december of  

by proposing that the ringleaders behind that circular 

letter that seems like organized resistance 

that they should be brought to trial for treason 

and using an obscure law they say that they should be 

brought to trial for treason in england 

they should go trial in england 

okay 

again not something thats going to make colonists really 

happy 

not surprisingly when you have the next election 

for the assembly in massachusetts in  

a large number of radicals get voted in 

and this new assembly passes logically enough 

radical resolutions again largely the work of samuel 

adams the sadly not goodlooking 

samuel adams laughter 

who declared in these resolutions that no man 

can be justly taxed by or bound in conscience to obey 

any law to which he has not given his consent in person or 

by his representative 

okay 

thats a stronger statement than the ones weve had before 

what hes saying hereformally 

like other colonial assemblies the massachusetts assembly was 

saying well parliament can legislate 

for us but they cant directly tax us without our consent but 

this statement says parliament cant legislate for 

us if we have no say in the process 

bang 

thats a very strong statement 

so clearly theres a lot of emotion that has been raised 

about what the british administration is doing 

its being vented in radical resolves like that 

the arrival of troops in boston in  ended up really focusing 


these feelings of grievance thesethis anger 

these sort of passions 

you have troops being sent to boston at a moment where people 

are angry at the british surely enough you can see that 

the colonists are going to vent their feelings towards the 

soldiers 

troops being sent to boston increase colonial assumptions 

that they are being treated as secondclass citizens 

as lowerclass subjects as people who are not equal to 

other british subjects within the empire 

and samuel adams said this really clearly in a newspaper 

article written at the time 

he it is well known from the first landing of 

the troops that the troops behavior was to a great degree 

insolent and such as looked as if they really believed that we 

were a country of rebels and that they were sent here to 

subdue us 

right 

again adams is propagandizing so hes always saying things 

with a sort of extra twist but what hes saying is 

it was very clear that when the troops arrived they were 

treating us like lowly rebels and that they were sent here to 

subdue us 

okay 

so given all of these feelingsfears about a 


tyrannical standing army thats inside a sort of system of 

tyranny it makes sense that when these 

troops arrive in boston relations are not going to be 

good between people in boston and soldiers in boston 

which brings us to yet another sort of bellringing 

revolutionary war moment a particularly noteworthy 

active resistance in boston later memorialized by clever 

colonial propagandists as the boston massacre 

right 

thats how we know it today 

they gave itcolonists gave it that name 

its a snappy name right 

we kept the name 

we like the name 

it really has some zing makes a political point 

so lets look for a minute here at the details of the boston 

massacre partly because theyre really 

interesting as youll see its just a really interesting 

incident but also because i think if you 

look at how the colonists and the soldiers were interacting 

it really will reveal something about the dynamic of 

colonialbritish relations at the time 

now first off its important to understand 

that the boston massacre wasnt this little isolated moment of 


conflict between soldiers and citizens 

between  and early  tensions were building between 

the colonists and the troops and in early  there 

actually were a number severaldifferent outbursts of 

hostility between townspeople and soldiers in boston 

so an on march nd samuel grey 

a rope maker asked a passing soldier if he 

wanted a job and when the soldier 

who was probably underpaid said yeah 

actually i could use a second job grey laughed and said 

good go clean my outhouse 

this did not make the soldier happy 

so the soldier slugged grey and grey hit back 

and other peoplesoldiers ran out and other colonists ran over 

and there was a fight there was a street fight 

a few days later march th another fight broke out when
