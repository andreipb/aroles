tuesday we ended with the angry response in  

colonies to the passage of the stamp act  

i talked abouti described patrick henry 

we had a firstour famous revolution moment number one 

patrick henry speaking out in the virginia house of burgesses 

talking about what he dramatically called his colonys 

dying liberty and at the very end of the 

lecture i mentioned that in may of  

the virginia house of burgesses passed some protesting 

resolutions ultimately known as the virginia resolves 

i think i said resolutions on tuesday and lets stick with 

resolves the virginia resolves 

and the virginia resolves saidthere were a number of 

different obviouslyresolves in the virginia resolves 

they said that the colonists had come to virginia with equal 

rights to all british subjects that the colonial charter 

confirmed that that virginians had the right 

to be governed by their own legislature 

and that the virginia legislature had never forfeited 

its right to impose taxes on the colony of virginia 

ill repeat that again 

the virginia resolves may colonists had come to 

virginia with equal rights to all british subjects 

colonial charters confirmed that 

virginians had the right to be governed by their own colonial 

legislature and the virginia colonial 

legislature had not forfeited its right to impose taxes on the 


colony of virginia 

now the house of burgesses passes these resolutions 

but in virginia they werent even published in the local 

newspaper 

however they were published in rhode island 

okay 

i really dont make this up 

i feel like youre going to accuse me of planting rhode 

island randomly throughout this course and im not 

itsreally its there all by itself 

rhode islandand why rhode island i cant tell youbut 

indeed by happenstance someone in rhode islandit 

circulates 

the resolves are circulating 

people are reading them and theyre talking about them 

but its somebody in rhode island who publishes the 

virginia resolves in a rhode island newspaper 

however what this person does when he publishes these resolves 


is not only publish the ones that were actually passed 

but there are two additional resolves that get published 

right alongside the ones that were passed 

these were not passed and possibly werent really even 

discussed and theyre more radical than the other 

resolutions 

but theyre put right alongside with no differentiation 

and these two unpassed more radical resolutions say 

quote his majestys liege people 

inhabitants of this colony are not bound to yield 

obedience to any law or ordinance whatsoever designed to 

impose any taxation upon them 

okay 


thats a much bolder statement than what i just said was 

happening in those virginia resolves 

and then the sort of more radical unpassed resolution 

number two that got published said 

that anyone who asserted that anyone except the virginia 

assembly could directly tax virginia was 

quote an enemy of this his majestys colony 

okay 

those are two really strong statements 

the virginia house of burgesses did not pass those 


did not resolve those but they get published in rhode 

island right alongside the ones that were passed and resolved 

and so they go circulating throughout the colonies 

making virginia look a lot more radical than it was at that 

particular moment 

so news of this sort of new radical version of the virginia 

resolves gets spread throughout the colonies and colonies are 

then inspired to pass resolves of their own 

so its another rhode island moment 

however it is massachusetts that first suggests united 


colonial action 

so in june of  the massachusetts assembly 

sends a circular letter to all of the colonial assemblies 

and a circular letter is kind of what it sounds like 

a letter intended to circulateto all of the 

colonial assemblies inviting them to meet in a congress in 

new york in october of  quote to consider of a 

general and united dutiful loyal and humble 

representation of their condition to his majesty and the 

parliament and to implore relief 

okay 

so its a united response but its also dutiful 

loyal and humble so on the one hand the fact 

that theres going to be some kind of a united colonial 

statement is interesting and forceful 

but on the other hand dutiful loyal 

humble 

were not  were not here declaring independence here 

were just kind of imploring relief making a statement that 

excuse we are your humble and obedient subjects and we 

dont really like this thank you very much 

so its that kind of a statement 

nine colonies responded 

new hampshire declined to participate 

virginia north carolina and georgia couldnt participate 

because their governors didnt convene their assemblies to 

elect delegates so there were no delegates 


elected but all in all there were 

twentyseven men who took part in what came to be known as the 

stamp act congress 

right 

easy enough to remember the stamp act congress 

which met for much of october in  

okay the stamp act congress 

the stamp act congress was actually the first of what were 

going to see is a series of extralegal organizations created 

outside of the regular colonial political system to resist and 

reform british policies  and so its a significant 

action on the part of the colonies 

and ultimately the stamp act congress passed a 

series of declarations and they kind of echo some of 

the resolutions and declarations that had been circulating and 

theyre going to sound not drastically different from some 

of the logic that ive been talking about in the last 

lecture or two 

and ill just mention four of the resolutions passed by the 


stamp act congress 

they declared that they owed their allegiance to the crown 

like any british subject they declared that they were 

entitled to the rights and liberties of any british 

subject they said that british subjects 

in the colonies could not be taxed without their consent 

and they declared that trial by jury was the right of every 

british subject in the colonies 

so you can see theirreally their statement is saying well 

were british subjects like any other british subject and were 

demanding the rights and liberties of other british 

subjects 

now its important to notethe resolutions are not saying that 

parliament had no right to regulate trade in the colonies 


theyre just saying that parliament cannot directly tax 

the colonies without their consent 

so again its a direct statement its a strong 

statement but its a respectful statement 

and its not boldly sort of altering 

at least in the minds of the colonists 

an enormous change of policy 

theyre kind of stating what they think the state of things 

is 

so clearly the stamp act congress is a step toward 

colonial unity its a significant step 


now actually i want to add at this point the answer to a 

question that someone asked at the end of class on tuesday 

and hes lurking over there 

i think that was you  yes 

inaudible it was a really good question 

i answer questionsand then i actually answer them in class 

it was a really good question and the question was did anyone 

in parliament actually oppose the stamp act and if they did 

what was the logic 

its actually a really good question and although i knew the 

answer was yes i couldnt tell you very much 

detail about that yes so i went and did a little 

research and its interesting 

most members of parliament assumed that the stamp act was 

i suppose you could say constitutional 

or that it was aboveboard proper 

that there was nothing wrong with it as far as procedurally 


and most members of parliament assumed that the colonists would 

agree its constitutional aboveboardtheres nothing 

wrong with it as far as the fact that it exists 

the stamp act is perfectly proper 

some members of parliament and not a lot but some 

did admit that maybe parliament was treading on dangerous 

ground but even these people didnt 

worry about the stamp act on constitutional grounds 

they didnt say wow 

i wonder if we have the right to do this 

rather they worried that maybe the colonists were going to be 

unhappy because the stamp act maybe would seem too burdensome 


or they worried that maybe the colonists would think this was 

some kind of an aggressive display of parliamentary power 

but members of parliament were actually not worried about this 

seeming as though its something that wasnt proper 

wasnt allowable wasnt supposed to be done 

within the confines of the british imperial system 

so basically what youre seeing here is sort of a version of 

what ive been saying in a variety of different ways so far 


in this course 

ive been talking about different mindsets developing 

and both sides sort of not necessarily understanding that 

there are different mindsets evolving here 

what youre seeing here is basically members of parliament 

just fundamentally not seeing that the colonists had developed 

a different understanding of the workings of the british imperial 

system and those members who were 

worried about the act they were worried about it 

being unpopular or maybe seeming too strong but they were not 

worried about any larger sort of legal rationale 

as one member put iti thought this was kind of a neat 

quote we are working in the 

dark and the less we do the better 

i thought thats a great quote because its basically a member 

of parliament saying im not entirely sure 

we dont really know what were doing 

and we dont really know how theyre going to respond 


so we actually need to be careful with what were doing 

because we just dont know what the response is going to be 

theyre notthey may not like it 

there actually was only one member of parliament who was a 

planter in the west indies one guy who predicted 

i think this stamp act is going to produce discord and 

confusion in the colonies 

right 

one guy so probably afterwards he was the guy saying 

yeah 

i told you laughs you should have listened to 

me 

i told you i knew 

okay 

so thats the answer to that question 

its a really good question because i had just never looked 

that up in any detail before 

okay 

soso far weve largely been talking about speechifying 

paperpushing resolves declarations 

newspaper announcements but in boston were now about 

to see some physical resistance 

because there some radicals decided no more 

wordsaction 


and these boston radicals as youre about to see 

they deployed a longheld colonial tradition of 

resistance 

they basically planned a mob action 

now its important to note that mobs in early america werent 

sort of wild violent outofcontrol 

oh my gosh its a riot kind of actions 

in a way they were sort of part of the political system 

something that people were supposed to do when they felt 

outraged 

it was sort of a way of venting popular protest 

and usually early american mobs were pretty conservative 

they were usually focused on protecting the good of the 

community from things like unfairly high food prices or 

illegal business practices 

normally they werent really excited about tearing things 

down 

normally they involved some marching and some yelling 

there was a lot of effigyburning 

and then people went home 

so early american mobs again are almost kind of procedural 

theyre sort of what happens when youre upset and youre a 

member of the public and its not only sort of 

average members of the public its not only the masses taking 

part in these kinds of protests 

all levels of society might take part at one time or 

another 


so in the summer of  some bostonians decided theyre 

going to take advantage of this tradition 

a group of boston radicals who eventually called themselves the 

sons of liberty so heres yet anothernow 

were starting to get to the part of the course where these 

things come out of my mouth and youre like ding 

ding ding ding revolutionary war moments 

sons of liberty and inaudible 

were going to have another one by the end of the lecture today 


but heres sons of liberty 

boston 

so these radicals decide theyre going to take action 

and the sons of liberty basically are artisans and 

shopkeepers who want to act in resistance to the stamp act 

samuel adamswhos really more a member of the elite 

but he nevertheless was kind of a champion of the artisan 

class and hes among their number too 

so lets look for a moment at what the sons of liberty decide 

to do and how it works out 

okay 

so basically in boston at the time there 

were two really large fraternal organizations of artisans 

there was one in the north end of boston there was one in the 

south end of boston 

and the sons of liberty thinkwell we have these sort 

of organized groups like clubs of artisans 

why dont we enlist the aid of one of them 

theyre sort of already organized 


they already have a leader 

maybe we could get them to help us in some sort of organized 

protest against the stamp act 

so they appeal to the south end group who agrees to take part 

in some kind of a protest 

so now we have this radical group the sons of liberty 

who have named themselves so theyre organized enough to 

have names 

we have an organized force of men 

and we have a focused desire to protest against an act of 

parliament 

so this is on its way to being a different kind of early 


american mob action than these other ones might have been 

okay 

so in boston the poor guy who was the stamp agent 

the stamp distributor is named andrew oliver 

this is the person you do not want to be at this particular 

moment 

okay 

so andrew oliver is the one whos going to be giving out or 

selling the stamps 

so obviously this group of men they want to do a mob action 

and they decide okay oliver is the target 

so first they go to his dockside warehouse 

they assume actually that thats where the stamped paper 


is going to be so they just destroy the 

warehouse  i mean like destroy it 

then they go to olivers house and throw rocks and basically 

break all of the windows 

then they take an effigy of oliver and they stamp on it 

okay thats not my pun 

thats actually their punright 

the stamp actwere stamping on oliverthose wacky early 

americans with their wild sense of humor 

bad puns of early america 

thats the first of this course 

so they stamp on andrew oliver 

oliver responds logically enough by resigning as stamp 

distributor laughs which i think was a wise move 

okay you think that 

thank you very much 

im going home to my brokenwindow house now 

laughs no more stamps for me 

okay 

not long after that maybe within two weeks 

that same group of men turn on lieutenant governor thomas 

hutchinson who seemed like a friend to the 

stamp act 

this time the mob goes to his house and they destroy it 

and i dont just mean rocks at windows 

they go to hutchinsons house they smash the windows 

they break in the doors they smash the furniture 

they cut the paintings they trash the clothing 

they cut down the trees in his garden 

and theyre in the process of removing the roof laughter 


when daylight stops them 

okay 

so this ison the one hand its sort of a weird mob 

theyre like excuse me 

can you pass me that hammer 

ive got to remove this shingle 

theyre really laughstheyre an industrious 

mob action but theyre literally 

completely tearing apart hutchinsons pretty sort of 

spiffy mansion in protest 

attacks on stamp distributors in other colonies followed and 

there were lots of resignations of stamp agents 

right im not doing the job 

laughs thanks 

i love my house 

i dont want to do this anymore 


so the result of all of this kind of action is that by 

november of  when the stamp act is actually 

going to go into effect so first of all 

the act actually hasnt gone into effect yet 

everything ive talked about is leading up to it actually going 

into effect 

so november of  its due to go into effect but 

people arent quite sure what to do 

do we ignore it 

are there actually any stamp agents left 

laughs maybe we dont have to ignore 

it because nobody will sell stamped paper 

i dont know 

and some people did just choose to ignore the act 


others went further and decided to boycott british goods which 

as were going to see further into this course 

was sometimes a really effective way to protest against 

the mother country basically hit economically and 

thats bound to make an impact 

but in the middle of all this grenvilles ministry fell 

not because of the stamp act but because of insider politics 

the colonists saw this as providential 

grenvilles gone 

clearly its a sign from providence that we are meant to 

succeed here to come out of this looking 

better than things were when we were in the middle of it 

the new prime minister is the earl of rockingham 

now the earl of rockingham had strong connections with london 


merchants 

london merchants clearly are people who are going to be 

deeply affected by colonial boycotting so they want the 

stamp act repealed 

so weve got this new prime minister the earl of 

rockingham hes in with the merchants who 

are being hurt by the boycott 

the idea now isit would be a fine thing if we could figure 

out a way to repeal the stamp act 

but the problem of course is figuring out how to repeal it 

without seeming weak while holding your ground 

and rockingham eventually did repeal the stamp act in march of 

 but to save face he assigned blame to the wounded 

british economy 

he did not say anything about colonial rights 

he said well the economy is suffering and so 

we will repeal the stamp act 

he also passed at the same time the declaratory act 

the declaratory actwhich declared in short that 

parliament could pass laws for the colonies 

quote in all cases whatsoever 

okay the declaratory act of  really strong statement 

its like yeah were going to repeal the stamp 

act but were going to pass this other act that says no 


we can basically pass laws for you however we want to pass 

them 

so were not caving were just sort of giving in on 

this one little point 

now to britain the declaratory act asserted 

their control over the colonies their legal control over the 

colonies in all cases 

to the colonists because it mentioned 

legislation but not taxes it seemed to suggest that maybe 

they had made their point that parliament is not going to 

assert taxation 

so in a way the declaratory act makes things worse 

it worsens ongoing misunderstandings between 

parliament and the colonies the british not fully 

understanding the colonial mindset about the workings of 

the empire the colonists not viewing their 

own logic as exceptional in any way 

they assume that their logic has been understood 

the declaratory act also didnt really encourage compromise 


because if you think about it moderates on all sides were 

discredited 

in england the declaratory act asserted parliamentary power 

so its a strong statement of power 

in the colonies radicals ruled the day 

because it seemed as though theyd made their point 

so as far as the colonies were concerned the stamp act crisis 

moved many to accept radical leadership 

it appears to be working 

it also revealed to the colonies the power of uniting 

the colonies to bring pressure against england 

which also seemed to have worked 

now once again in the middle of all this the prime minister yet 

again is replaced 

clearly this is not the time to be a prime minister in 

england 

its kind of a rocky time going on 

sorocky time was not meant to be a pun 

the earl of rockingham goes down in this rocky time and 


charlesi heard a groan 

i didnt do it on purpose 

it just sort of happened 

im sorry 

its a bad pun that i take full responsibility for 

but the earl of rockinghamhis ministry falls 

charles townshend takes his place 

charles townshend the new prime ministerand 

hes given the task of balancing the budget in  

and like grenville before him townshend first looks to 

england itself and issues new taxes in england 


but again he still needs more income and he does next turn to 

the colonies and he devises a scheme that he 

thinks isnt going to be too upsetting to these sort of 

touchy colonials 

he says hes going to proceed quote with great 

delicacy right 

because its clear now they get upset over there 

they get upset 

we need to be careful im going to proceed with great 

delicacy 

he understands their sensitivity about this whole 

issue of taxation 

so he decides hes going to ask for customs duties on items that 


the colonies import from britain like glass 

silk paper paint andtea 

laughs you can see where were going 

but this is not an internal tax 

this is an external tax 

its not a tax on things within the colonies 

its not a tax on legal documents 

its not a tax on playing cards like the stamp act 

its an external tax 

its customs duties 

and like before townshend wants the money 

raised by this to go to pay for royal administration in the 

colonies so also the money raised isnt 

going back to england its going to be spent on the 

colonies 

townshend also reorganized the customs service in the colonies 

basically tossing out old customs agents who had been 

bought by colonial merchants and putting handpicked men in their 

place 

so all in all townshend thoughtsurely these 

are tame enough measures that the colonists arent going to 

object to them 

right 

this seems as though theyre accommodating 

theyre mild nothing very dramatic is being 

done here 

these come to be known as the townshend acts of  

and sure enough the initial response to the 

townshend acts is relatively weak 

but colonial anger is raised yet again by a publication by a 

colonist named john dickinson 

hes a pennsylvanian 

hes in pennsylvania and he writes a series of letters 


first they appear in a pennsylvania newspaper 

theyre eventually published in other colonial newspapers 

and then finally theyre put together and published in a 

pamphlet 

this is all in and the pamphlet is named lettersi 

from a farmer in pennsylvania to the inhabitants of the  

colonies they had very literal titles in these  

this is one of them 

john dickinson pennsylvanian 

letters from a farmer in pennsylvania to the  


of the british colonies  

now dickinson actuallywhen you read these 

hes pretty moderate in tone 

and most of what he does is he uses past precedent to argue 

against the right of parliament to directly tax the colonies 

he asserts were not talking about 

independence were just talking about past 

precedent 

however he also says and this is a quote from him 

we cannot be happy without being free 

we cannot be free without being secure in our property 

we cannot be secure in our property 

if without our consent others may 


as by right take it away 

that taxes imposed on us by parliament 

do thus take it away 

thats really clear direct logic 

right 

we cant be happy without being free 

we cant be free without being secure in our property 

we cant be secure in our property if without our consent 

others may take it away and parliament seems to be 

taking it away 

so dickinson isnt arguing anything amazingly new here 

but hes certainly stating it with real clarity and real 


power 

and he also appears to be saying well 

some of that stuff we learned from that whole stamp act thing 

i think they apply as well to this new townshend act thing 

he appears to be drawing a pattern 

so letters from a farmer in pennsylvania ultimately has 

an impact 

its a strong statement 

up in boston there was also some writing 

going on 

and there samuel adams who was in the massachusetts 

assembly wrote a circular letter that he sent to other 

colonies 

yet again another circular letter 

and this time its a circular letter protesting against the 

townshend acts and its moderate 

but its criticizing the acts 

it does denyitswere  this isnt about independence 

were not trying to rebel herebut it does urge joint 

colonial resistance to the townshend acts 

now back in england many people urged a lenient 

response to this 

if you think about it potentially 

its a scary thing 

you have this guythis radical guy in bostonwhos urging 

joint colonial resistance to an act of parliament 

so as you will see some people get rather upset by 

this but not everybody 

some people say well okay 


lets not overrespond lets not overreact 

however the british secretary of state lord hillsborough 

really saw this as organized resistance and refused to stand 

for it 

so in  privately consulting with the king 

so kind of doing this off on the side 

he instructed the governor of massachusetts to dissolve the 

massachusetts assembly unless they took back the letter 

he also sent a letter to all royal governors telling them to 

ignore the massachusetts letter or else he would dissolve their 

legislatures too 

okay 

thatstheres a strong statement for you thats clearly 

bound to make colonists get very very upset 

hillsborough also knowing that people are going 

to get upset urged general thomas 

gagewhos commanderinchief of the army and at the time was 

posted in new york he urges gage in new york to 

prepare his troops in case theyre needed in boston 

okay 

so hes anticipating there might be a response 

it would be nice to have troops potentially ready to go to 

boston 

so now troops are being organized 

theres threats about dissolving assemblies 

and communication between the colonies in the form of a 

circular letter is being discouraged 

so clearly if youre a colonist at this point 

there appears to be a plan of repression right 

a plan 

there seems to be a system of tyranny 

there seems to be some kind of organized attack on colonial 

liberties and im emphasizing plan and 

system and organized because next week thats the direction 

were going to be going with the lectures 

were going to be looking at what i call the logic of 

resistance orhow does all of this add up in the minds of the 

colonists 

whatswhat are they drawingwhat conclusions are 

they drawing based on actions that are happening 

and as well see in the lectures and in the readings for 


next week theres a lot of conclusions 

being drawn about an actual system of tyranny 

which is a very eighteenthcentury way of kind 

of looking at it 

so colonists are wondering if theres a sort of system of 

repression being put in place 

meanwhile parliament eventually in  

repeals most of the townshend acts but does preserve the tax 

on tea partly for revenue and partly 

to prove that they still have the right to tax the colonies 

so were halfseeing revenue raising and halfseeing an 

argument here 

and probably there was an assumption on the part of 


parliament that by repealing most of the acts things would 

quiet down but as events in boston were 

about to prove this would not be the case 

as were about to see between  and  

boston really ends up taking center stage 

and thanks in part to the actions of samuel adams who 

really is youll see todaya brilliant 

propagandist and a man with a really fierce sense of his 

rights his british rights and his 

grievances as an english subject 

and i will add that samuel adams did brew beer 

right 

he actually issamuel adams is associated with beer 

so truth in advertising though i have no idea if thats 

an accurate portrait of sam adams 

its paul  

sam adams is too ugly 

sam adams is too  

laughs oh poor sam adams 

i feel very bad now 

laughs oh 

well hes not attractive but i dont know if hes ugly 

i feel bad 

now im going to have to find a way to redeem sam adams in the 

laughs 

thank you very much 

no wonder i didnt think it was entirely an accurate 

portraitokay 


and yet he is associated with beer 

okay 

so sam adamshes going to have a moment 

october of  troops actually arrive in 

boston at the instigation of massachusetts royal governor 

francis bernard whos alarmed at the sort of 

radical rumblings that hes hearing 

parliament makes things worse byin december of  

by proposing that the ringleaders behind that circular 

letter that seems like organized resistance 

that they should be brought to trial for treason 

and using an obscure law they say that they should be 

brought to trial for treason in england 

they should go trial in england 

okay 

again not something thats going to make colonists really 

happy 

not surprisingly when you have the next election 

for the assembly in massachusetts in  

a large number of radicals get voted in 

and this new assembly passes logically enough 

radical resolutions again largely the work of samuel 

adams the sadly not goodlooking 

samuel adams laughter 

who declared in these resolutions that no man 

can be justly taxed by or bound in conscience to obey 

any law to which he has not given his consent in person or 

by his representative 

okay 

thats a stronger statement than the ones weve had before 

what hes saying hereformally 

like other colonial assemblies the massachusetts assembly was 

saying well parliament can legislate 

for us but they cant directly tax us without our consent but 

this statement says parliament cant legislate for 

us if we have no say in the process 

bang 

thats a very strong statement 

so clearly theres a lot of emotion that has been raised 

about what the british administration is doing 

its being vented in radical resolves like that 

the arrival of troops in boston in  ended up really focusing 


these feelings of grievance thesethis anger 

these sort of passions 

you have troops being sent to boston at a moment where people 

are angry at the british surely enough you can see that 

the colonists are going to vent their feelings towards the 

soldiers 

troops being sent to boston increase colonial assumptions 

that they are being treated as secondclass citizens 

as lowerclass subjects as people who are not equal to 

other british subjects within the empire 

and samuel adams said this really clearly in a newspaper 

article written at the time 

he it is well known from the first landing of 

the troops that the troops behavior was to a great degree 

insolent and such as looked as if they really believed that we 

were a country of rebels and that they were sent here to 

subdue us 

right 

again adams is propagandizing so hes always saying things 

with a sort of extra twist but what hes saying is 

it was very clear that when the troops arrived they were 

treating us like lowly rebels and that they were sent here to 

subdue us 

okay 

so given all of these feelingsfears about a 


tyrannical standing army thats inside a sort of system of 

tyranny it makes sense that when these 

troops arrive in boston relations are not going to be 

good between people in boston and soldiers in boston 

which brings us to yet another sort of bellringing 

revolutionary war moment a particularly noteworthy 

active resistance in boston later memorialized by clever 

colonial propagandists as the boston massacre 

right 

thats how we know it today 

they gave itcolonists gave it that name 

its a snappy name right 

we kept the name 

we like the name 

it really has some zing makes a political point 

so lets look for a minute here at the details of the boston 

massacre partly because theyre really 

interesting as youll see its just a really interesting 

incident but also because i think if you 

look at how the colonists and the soldiers were interacting 

it really will reveal something about the dynamic of 

colonialbritish relations at the time 

now first off its important to understand 

that the boston massacre wasnt this little isolated moment of 


conflict between soldiers and citizens 

between  and early  tensions were building between 

the colonists and the troops and in early  there 

actually were a number severaldifferent outbursts of 

hostility between townspeople and soldiers in boston 

so an on march nd samuel grey 

a rope maker asked a passing soldier if he 

wanted a job and when the soldier 

who was probably underpaid said yeah 

actually i could use a second job grey laughed and said 

good go clean my outhouse 

this did not make the soldier happy 

so the soldier slugged grey and grey hit back 

and other peoplesoldiers ran out and other colonists ran over 

and there was a fight there was a street fight 

a few days later march th another fight broke out when 


another civilian said something insulting to another soldier and 

they began punching each other and there was another street 

fight and that would be the first in 

a series of increasingly agitated clashes on that day 

march th  thats going to end in 

gunfire 

but obviously the boston massacre is not the first moment 

of conflict 

now later that eveningtheres a series of little outbursts 

that day march th 

later that evening a small boy walking out on the street began 

taunting a soldier and the soldier responded by 


knocking him down 

well the boy got up went off found some other 

colonists in the street and complained that a soldier over 

there had knocked him down 

okay 

so in this environment thats going to really get a lot of 

colonists upset 

so a little ring of people surrounds the kid 

hes knocking down a kid 

we need to go get the soldiers 

right 

so a small group of colonists heads off to the barracks to 


actually accost the soldiers but theyre held off by guards 

soon thereafter someone begins ringing the bell 

of the boston meeting house and normally when you ring the 

bell of the boston meeting house thats a signal for fire 

and fire is a serious thing in a place full of wooden 

buildings 

right 

so if the bell is ringing that means oh my god 

theres a fireand everyone does what they should do when 

theres an alarm of fire 

right 

the bell goes off and dozens and dozens and dozens of people 

run in to the street thinking that theres a fire 

now from this point we have several accounts 

there are a number of accounts about what happened 

some of them conflict and were going to be looking 

at two accounts today 

were going to be looking at one by british general thomas 

gage i mentioned before the commanderinchief of the 

british army in america 

hes posted in new york but he had gotten a very detailed 


report about what happened in boston from his soldiers 

his officers and menon exactly what they think they 

experienced 

and then the other account is by samuel adams 

radical propagandistclearly is going to be a very different 

point of view 

okay 

so gage sends a very detailed report to a member of the kings 

cabinet in london based on what the british soldiers in boston 


told him 

assuming that the colonists in general were insolent and were 

pushing to get more than they deserved 

gage says in his statement he suspects that the entire 

thing was deliberate 

he thinks that there were some colonists who probably 

prearranged what happened armed themselves with sticks 

rocks bricks and snowballs 

im sorry but snowballs just never sounds like a scary weapon 

to me even though bad things happen 

here and i know i would not like to 

be hit with a snowball but its not like a brick 

but snowballs areeveryones complaining about snowballs in 

these accounts youll see 

somehow it just makes it seem less serious 

i dont know why 

but anyway he thinks its deliberate 

he thinks the colonists prearranged it 

that they armed themselves with sticks rocks 

bricks and snowballs planned the ringing of the bell 


so that bostonians would rise up at the signal and attack the 

soldiers 

okay 

so this is what gage assumesand here is gages 

account 

many people came out of their houses supposing a fire in 

the town and several officers on the 

same supposition were repairing to their posts 

but meeting with mobs were reviled attacked 

and those who could not escape knocked down and treated with 

great inhumanity 

right 

those crude nasty colonists are treating 

the soldiers very badly 

different mobs paraded through the streets 

passing the several barracks and provoking the soldiers to 


come out 

one body went to the main guard where every provocation was 

given without effect for the guard remained quiet 

from thence the mob proceeded to a sentinel 

a single sentinel  posted upon the 

customhouse at a small distance from the 

guard and attacked him 

he defended himself as well as he could calling out for 

help 

okay 

theres one guy according to this account 

and the mob attacks the one guy standing in front of the customs 

house 

and people ran to the guard to give information of his 

danger 

so according to gage people see this one guy getting 

attacked by a bunch of people and they 

actually colonistsrun to get other soldiers to help the one 

guy 

so according to gages account theyre not all crazy radicals 

in boston 

some of them are out there helping us 

captain preston hearing the sentinel was in 

danger of being murderedalready 

we got to murder really fasthe detached a 

sergeant and  men to relieve him and soon after followed 

himself to prevent to prevent any rash act on the part of the 

troops 

this party as well as the sentinel was immediately 

attacked some colonists throwing bricks 

stones pieces of ice 

and snowballs once again the 

snowballsat them whilst others advanced up to their 


bayonets and endeavored to close with them to use their bludgeons 

and clubs calling out to them to fire if 

they dared and provoking them in a most opprobrious 

language 

right 

again  rude colonists behaving badly 

so we have a group of soldiers that are lined up in front of 

the customs house running to protect a fellow soldier 

supposedly being murdered at the hands of a crude and angry mob 

armed with sticks and rocks and snowballs 

okay lets segue over to adams 

adams writes a series of newspaper essays for the 

boston gazette describing the same  

often quoting testimony from the trial of the soldiers that 

obviously takes place after this incident 

but also obviously quoting them and telling the story with his 

own radical flair 

now remember here the different reasons for these accounts 

and this is actually a great example of the importance of 

thinking about the nature of historical evidence 

who things are written to and why theyre written has a 

lot to do with how you interpret  

right 

you have these two documents being written for really 

specific reasons to a very specific audience 

so gage is trying to explain to royal authorities a shooting 

that never should have happened 


he has to somehow justify this so hes appealing to the people 

he sent the letter to whoever this royal authority 

wasand he has to assume that other royal authorities are 

going to see it 

hes appealing to them as fellow sophisticated englishmen 

who understand the nature of things out in this sort of 

frontier colony area crude colonists 

upset colonists 

so in a sense gage is offering sort of an extreme version of 

some typical english sentiment amongabout the colonies 


adams is writing to the colonial public and hes trying 

to raise a public outcry against the soldiers and obviously by 

association against the british 

administration and clearly adams is going to 

want to depict these soldiers as cruel and tyrannical as all 

standing armies are so in a sense adams is 

certainly going to be offering an extreme version of some 

colonial sentiment at the time about the soldiers and maybe 

about the british administration generally 

okay 

so here is adams version from the moment when the bell starts 

to ring 

the ringing of the bells alarmed the town 

it being supposed by the people in general there was a fire 

as the people came in to the street the boy who had been 

knocked down told them that the sentry had knocked him 

down 

okay and im actually quoting so thisyou cant blame me for 

this 

the boy says a sentry knocked me down 

points at the solider and says theres the son of a 

bitch that knocked me down 

laughter i love that that detail is in 

the newspaper laughsand thats another one of those 

things that likethey said that in  

laughter and they did 

other people heard this and cried kill him 

laughter hey 

laughs the sentry ran to the 

customhouse steps knocked at the door 

but could not get in 

excuse me 

laughs theyre going to kill me 

he primed and loaded his gun and leveled it and told the 

people to stand off and called to the main guard 

various were the dispositions and inclinations of 

the people at this point 

the cooler sort advised to go the curious were 

willing to stay and see the event 

and those whose feelings were warmer 

perhaps partook of the boys resentment 

and here hes trying to justify likeokay there were some 


crazy radical guys but they were probably upset with the 

boy 

right they werent angry 

they were justof course theyd be upset 

the boy was attacked 

the soldiers moved to help the sentry standing alone before the 

mob 

adams said the soldiers moved quote 

with an haughty air they pushd their bayonets and 

damnd the people as they went along 

and when they arrivd at their post 

one witness who is a young gentleman of a liberal education 


and an unspotted character laughter 

declared that one of the soldiers whom he particularly 

named loaded his gun 

pushed him with his bayonet and damnd him 

ooh okay 

laughter so here according to adams 

theres this rude imperious british soldier 

treating the young gentleman of a liberal education and 

unspotted character laughs like a lesser being 

okay 

so now both narrators have gotten us to the same point 

we have soldiers lined up 

they have just very visibly loaded their guns 

in front of them stands british captain preston withwho is in 

command of the menand in front of preston is an angry crowd 

so according to gage at this point preston 

soldiers behind himcrowd in front of him 

hes trying to calm the situation down 

and supposedly hes asked are you going to ask those 

soldiers to fire on us 

and preston says yeah 

see the guns are behind me and youre in front of me 


no really 

laughter it wouldnt be a good idea for 

them to fire now because ill die 

right 

laughter hes like no 

its a good point i think 

but all he could say had no effect and one of the 

soldiers receiving a violent blow instantly fired 

captain preston turned around to see who fired 

and received a blow upon his arm which was aimed at his 

head and the mob 

at first seeing no execution done and imagining the soldiers 


had only fired powder to frighten them 

grew more bold and attacked with greater violence 

continually striking at the soldiers and pelting them 

and calling out to them to fire 

and we have captain prestons description of what he heard 

from the crowd 

he says the crowd was yelling come on 

you rascals bloody backs 

lobster scoundrels 

laughs quite a little string of 

insults 

fire if you dare 

you dare not fire 

okay 

so gage goes on the soldiers at length 

perceiving their lives in danger 

and hearing the word fire all round them 

three or four of them fired one after another 

and again three more in the hurry and confusion 

four or five persons were unfortunately killedun 

fortunatelyand more wounded 

okay 

so thats basically the end of gages account 

clearly in his account the soldiers are under serious 


attack 

adams tells a different story 

adams says yes the crowd was yelling at the 

troops but they had insulted the crowd and loaded their guns 

yes they had sticks but everybody was carrying sticks 

these days because everyone was scared of the soldiers 

so everyone naturally walked around in the streets with 

sticks 

now maybe thats true which tells you a lot about the 

streets of boston or maybe its not in which case 

its really creative 

laughter yes the crowd hit at the 

soldiers guns but they were trying to push them away 

so adams says its not an uncontrolled mob 

its actually a group of people carrying their normal 

everyday sticks laughter 

pushing in to hear captain preston answer the question 

about whether or not he was going to order the troops to 

fire 

at this moment adams says one of the soldiers 

was hit by a stick staggered fired his gun at the 

crowd upon which several soldiers fired and says adams 

they reloaded their guns 

they were going to fire again 

some of the crowd moved away 

one man went up to a soldier and asked him to his face if he 

was going to fire and supposedly the soldier 


said quote yes by the eternal 

god at which point the colonists knocked him down 

laughter i love all the detail 

at this point preston called out to his men not to fire and 

they stopped and here adams says 

i am no soldier and never desired to be 

but i appeal to those who are whether the words 

dont fire are words of command in the british army 

and whether there is not some other word which soldiers are 


taught to understand more proper to be given on such 

an occasion  

which would have prevented such rashness 

so here hes saying the guy didnt even call out 

cease fire 

he said dont stop laughs great 

thank you captain preston 

and then adams describes the people who died 

he makes special note of the fact that grey 

the rope maker who insulted the sentry by asking him to clean 

the outhouse is killed in the clash 

coincidence or murder 

laughter adams is good 

right 

and so here adams is tossing out the suggestion that maybe 

the troops were just looking for an excuse to fire on the 

townspeople and then really get that nasty 

grey plotting maybe 

and the british too as youve heard 

are wondering if maybe this is a plot on the part of the 

colonists 

maybe theyre actually just trying to rob the customs house 

and this whole thing was an elaborate ploy by the colonists 


just to rob the customs house behind the guard 

so you can really see from these two accounts 

and from the details contained within them 

the animosity and the sense of alienation between the colonists 

and the soldiers on both sides and you can also see really 

dramatically the fears on both sides that theres some kind of 

a plot theres some kind of a plot of 

resistance or tyranny depending on which side youre 

on
