and most members of parliament assumed that the colonists would 

agree its constitutional aboveboardtheres nothing 

wrong with it as far as the fact that it exists 

the stamp act is perfectly proper 

some members of parliament and not a lot but some 

did admit that maybe parliament was treading on dangerous 

ground but even these people didnt 

worry about the stamp act on constitutional grounds 

they didnt say wow 

i wonder if we have the right to do this 

rather they worried that maybe the colonists were going to be 

unhappy because the stamp act maybe would seem too burdensome 


or they worried that maybe the colonists would think this was 

some kind of an aggressive display of parliamentary power 

but members of parliament were actually not worried about this 

seeming as though its something that wasnt proper 

wasnt allowable wasnt supposed to be done 

within the confines of the british imperial system 

so basically what youre seeing here is sort of a version of 

what ive been saying in a variety of different ways so far 


in this course 

ive been talking about different mindsets developing 

and both sides sort of not necessarily understanding that 

there are different mindsets evolving here 

what youre seeing here is basically members of parliament 

just fundamentally not seeing that the colonists had developed 

a different understanding of the workings of the british imperial 

system and those members who were 

worried about the act they were worried about it 

being unpopular or maybe seeming too strong but they were not 

worried about any larger sort of legal rationale 

as one member put iti thought this was kind of a neat 

quote we are working in the 

dark and the less we do the better 

i thought thats a great quote because its basically a member 

of parliament saying im not entirely sure 

we dont really know what were doing 

and we dont really know how theyre going to respond 


so we actually need to be careful with what were doing 

because we just dont know what the response is going to be 

theyre notthey may not like it 

there actually was only one member of parliament who was a 

planter in the west indies one guy who predicted 

i think this stamp act is going to produce discord and 

confusion in the colonies 

right 

one guy so probably afterwards he was the guy saying 

yeah 

i told you laughs you should have listened to 

me 

i told you i knew 

okay 

so thats the answer to that question 

its a really good question because i had just never looked 

that up in any detail before 

okay 

soso far weve largely been talking about speechifying 

paperpushing resolves declarations 

newspaper announcements but in boston were now about 

to see some physical resistance 

because there some radicals decided no more 

wordsaction 


and these boston radicals as youre about to see 

they deployed a longheld colonial tradition of 

resistance 

they basically planned a mob action 

now its important to note that mobs in early america werent 

sort of wild violent outofcontrol 

oh my gosh its a riot kind of actions 

in a way they were sort of part of the political system 

something that people were supposed to do when they felt 

outraged 

it was sort of a way of venting popular protest 

and usually early american mobs were pretty conservative 

they were usually focused on protecting the good of the 

community from things like unfairly high food prices or 

illegal business practices 

normally they werent really excited about tearing things 

down 

normally they involved some marching and some yelling 

there was a lot of effigyburning 

and then people went home 

so early american mobs again are almost kind of procedural 

theyre sort of what happens when youre upset and youre a 

member of the public and its not only sort of 

average members of the public its not only the masses taking 

part in these kinds of protests 

all levels of society might take part at one time or 

another 


so in the summer of  some bostonians decided theyre 

going to take advantage of this tradition 

a group of boston radicals who eventually called themselves the 

sons of liberty so heres yet anothernow 

were starting to get to the part of the course where these 

things come out of my mouth and youre like ding 

ding ding ding revolutionary war moments 

sons of liberty and inaudible 

were going to have another one by the end of the lecture today 


but heres sons of liberty 

boston 

so these radicals decide theyre going to take action 

and the sons of liberty basically are artisans and 

shopkeepers who want to act in resistance to the stamp act 

samuel adamswhos really more a member of the elite 

but he nevertheless was kind of a champion of the artisan 

class and hes among their number too 

so lets look for a moment at what the sons of liberty decide 

to do and how it works out 

okay 

so basically in boston at the time there 

were two really large fraternal organizations of artisans 

there was one in the north end of boston there was one in the 

south end of boston 

and the sons of liberty thinkwell we have these sort 

of organized groups like clubs of artisans 

why dont we enlist the aid of one of them 

theyre sort of already organized 


they already have a leader 

maybe we could get them to help us in some sort of organized 

protest against the stamp act 

so they appeal to the south end group who agrees to take part 

in some kind of a protest 

so now we have this radical group the sons of liberty 

who have named themselves so theyre organized enough to 

have names 

we have an organized force of men 

and we have a focused desire to protest against an act of 

parliament 

so this is on its way to being a different kind of early 


american mob action than these other ones might have been 

okay 

so in boston the poor guy who was the stamp agent 

the stamp distributor is named andrew oliver 

this is the person you do not want to be at this particular 

moment 

okay 

so andrew oliver is the one whos going to be giving out or 

selling the stamps 

so obviously this group of men they want to do a mob action 

and they decide okay oliver is the target 

so first they go to his dockside warehouse 

they assume actually that thats where the stamped paper 


is going to be so they just destroy the 

warehouse  i mean like destroy it 

then they go to olivers house and throw rocks and basically 

break all of the windows 

then they take an effigy of oliver and they stamp on it 

okay thats not my pun 

thats actually their punright 

the stamp actwere stamping on oliverthose wacky early 

americans with their wild sense of humor 

bad puns of early america 

thats the first of this course 

so they stamp on andrew oliver 

oliver responds logically enough by resigning as stamp 

distributor laughs which i think was a wise move 

okay you think that 

thank you very much 

im going home to my brokenwindow house now 

laughs no more stamps for me 

okay 

not long after that maybe within two weeks 

that same group of men turn on lieutenant governor thomas 

hutchinson who seemed like a friend to the 

stamp act 

this time the mob goes to his house and they destroy it 

and i dont just mean rocks at windows 

they go to hutchinsons house they smash the windows 

they break in the doors they smash the furniture 

they cut the paintings they trash the clothing 

they cut down the trees in his garden 

and theyre in the process of removing the roof laughter
