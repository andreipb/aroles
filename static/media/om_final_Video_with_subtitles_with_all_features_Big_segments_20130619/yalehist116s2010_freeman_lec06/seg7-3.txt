when daylight stops them 

okay 

so this ison the one hand its sort of a weird mob 

theyre like excuse me 

can you pass me that hammer 

ive got to remove this shingle 

theyre really laughstheyre an industrious 

mob action but theyre literally 

completely tearing apart hutchinsons pretty sort of 

spiffy mansion in protest 

attacks on stamp distributors in other colonies followed and 

there were lots of resignations of stamp agents 

right im not doing the job 

laughs thanks 

i love my house 

i dont want to do this anymore 


so the result of all of this kind of action is that by 

november of  when the stamp act is actually 

going to go into effect so first of all 

the act actually hasnt gone into effect yet 

everything ive talked about is leading up to it actually going 

into effect 

so november of  its due to go into effect but 

people arent quite sure what to do 

do we ignore it 

are there actually any stamp agents left 

laughs maybe we dont have to ignore 

it because nobody will sell stamped paper 

i dont know 

and some people did just choose to ignore the act 


others went further and decided to boycott british goods which 

as were going to see further into this course 

was sometimes a really effective way to protest against 

the mother country basically hit economically and 

thats bound to make an impact 

but in the middle of all this grenvilles ministry fell 

not because of the stamp act but because of insider politics 

the colonists saw this as providential 

grenvilles gone 

clearly its a sign from providence that we are meant to 

succeed here to come out of this looking 

better than things were when we were in the middle of it 

the new prime minister is the earl of rockingham 

now the earl of rockingham had strong connections with london 


merchants 

london merchants clearly are people who are going to be 

deeply affected by colonial boycotting so they want the 

stamp act repealed 

so weve got this new prime minister the earl of 

rockingham hes in with the merchants who 

are being hurt by the boycott 

the idea now isit would be a fine thing if we could figure 

out a way to repeal the stamp act 

but the problem of course is figuring out how to repeal it 

without seeming weak while holding your ground 

and rockingham eventually did repeal the stamp act in march of 

 but to save face he assigned blame to the wounded 

british economy 

he did not say anything about colonial rights 

he said well the economy is suffering and so 

we will repeal the stamp act 

he also passed at the same time the declaratory act 

the declaratory actwhich declared in short that 

parliament could pass laws for the colonies 

quote in all cases whatsoever 

okay the declaratory act of  really strong statement 

its like yeah were going to repeal the stamp 

act but were going to pass this other act that says no 


we can basically pass laws for you however we want to pass 

them 

so were not caving were just sort of giving in on 

this one little point 

now to britain the declaratory act asserted 

their control over the colonies their legal control over the 

colonies in all cases 

to the colonists because it mentioned 

legislation but not taxes it seemed to suggest that maybe 

they had made their point that parliament is not going to 

assert taxation 

so in a way the declaratory act makes things worse 

it worsens ongoing misunderstandings between 

parliament and the colonies the british not fully 

understanding the colonial mindset about the workings of 

the empire the colonists not viewing their 

own logic as exceptional in any way 

they assume that their logic has been understood 

the declaratory act also didnt really encourage compromise 


because if you think about it moderates on all sides were 

discredited 

in england the declaratory act asserted parliamentary power 

so its a strong statement of power 

in the colonies radicals ruled the day 

because it seemed as though theyd made their point 

so as far as the colonies were concerned the stamp act crisis 

moved many to accept radical leadership 

it appears to be working 

it also revealed to the colonies the power of uniting 

the colonies to bring pressure against england 

which also seemed to have worked 

now once again in the middle of all this the prime minister yet 

again is replaced 

clearly this is not the time to be a prime minister in 

england 

its kind of a rocky time going on 

sorocky time was not meant to be a pun 

the earl of rockingham goes down in this rocky time and 


charlesi heard a groan 

i didnt do it on purpose 

it just sort of happened 

im sorry 

its a bad pun that i take full responsibility for 

but the earl of rockinghamhis ministry falls 

charles townshend takes his place 

charles townshend the new prime ministerand 

hes given the task of balancing the budget in  

and like grenville before him townshend first looks to 

england itself and issues new taxes in england 


but again he still needs more income and he does next turn to 

the colonies and he devises a scheme that he 

thinks isnt going to be too upsetting to these sort of 

touchy colonials 

he says hes going to proceed quote with great 

delicacy right 

because its clear now they get upset over there 

they get upset 

we need to be careful im going to proceed with great 

delicacy 

he understands their sensitivity about this whole 

issue of taxation 

so he decides hes going to ask for customs duties on items that 


the colonies import from britain like glass 

silk paper paint andtea 

laughs you can see where were going 

but this is not an internal tax 

this is an external tax 

its not a tax on things within the colonies 

its not a tax on legal documents 

its not a tax on playing cards like the stamp act 

its an external tax 

its customs duties 

and like before townshend wants the money 

raised by this to go to pay for royal administration in the 

colonies so also the money raised isnt 

going back to england its going to be spent on the 

colonies 

townshend also reorganized the customs service in the colonies 

basically tossing out old customs agents who had been 

bought by colonial merchants and putting handpicked men in their 

place 

so all in all townshend thoughtsurely these 

are tame enough measures that the colonists arent going to 

object to them 

right 

this seems as though theyre accommodating 

theyre mild nothing very dramatic is being 

done here 

these come to be known as the townshend acts of  

and sure enough the initial response to the 

townshend acts is relatively weak 

but colonial anger is raised yet again by a publication by a 

colonist named john dickinson 

hes a pennsylvanian 

hes in pennsylvania and he writes a series of letters 


first they appear in a pennsylvania newspaper 

theyre eventually published in other colonial newspapers 

and then finally theyre put together and published in a 

pamphlet 

this is all in and the pamphlet is named lettersi 

from a farmer in pennsylvania to the inhabitants of the  

colonies they had very literal titles in these  

this is one of them 

john dickinson pennsylvanian 

letters from a farmer in pennsylvania to the
