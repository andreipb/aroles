Description
This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience. 
It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can 
play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their 
major, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs 
that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Python™ programming language.
