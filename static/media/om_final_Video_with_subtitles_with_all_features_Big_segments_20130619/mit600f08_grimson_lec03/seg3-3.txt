all right 

because what am i going to do 

im going to come down and say is ans squared less 

than or equal to x 

if it is im going to go around and execute that 

statement check it again and go around and execute that 

so im going to cycle around that loop there enough times to 

get to the answer and that number of times is going to 


depend on the input so as i change the input im going to 

change the complexity of the code 

now this happens to be what we would call a linear process 

because the number of times i go around the loop is directly 

related to the size of the argument 

if i double the argument im going to double the number of 

times i go around the loop 

if i increase it by five im going to increase by five the 

number of times i go around the loop 

well see later on there are classes of computation that are 

inherently much more complex 

we hate them because theyre costly but theyre sometimes 

inherently that way 

but you can see the comparison between these two 

ok 

now having done that lets build this code 

yeah if my machine will come back up there we go 

so im going to now go ahead and write a little piece of 

code and i put it here and i hope you can actually see these 

better this time let me uncomment that region 

all right 

so theres basically an encapsulation of 

that code right 

it says what look at this where am i right here ive 

got some value for x initially im going to set ans to  just 

like there and theres my loop theres the test which 


is right like that is ans squared less than or equal to 

x if it is theres the block corresponding to the loop 

change ans and eventually when im done with all this thing 

im just going to print ans out 

ok 

all right let me show you one other tool that i want to use 

which is ive written that piece of code 

i ought to check it 

well i could just run it but another useful thing to do is 

im especially as i want to debug these things is 


to simulate that code 

and im going to do this because as professor guttag 

noticed to me students seem reluctant to do this 

i guess its not macho enough john to just you know you 

know go off and do things by hand you ought to just run 

them but its a valuable tool to get into so let 

me do that here 

unintelligible 

professor eric im doing such a great job 

ive got to say when my ive got two sons now aged eighteen 


and twenty they used to think i had the coolest job in 

the world because i came home covered in chalk 

now they have a different opinion that you can 

probably figure out 

all right 

simulate the code 

what i mean by that is pick a simple set of values and lets 

walk through it to see what happens 

and this is useful because its going to allow me to a make 

sure that ive got something thats going to terminate its 

going to let me make sure that in fact im doing the 

right kinds of updates 

i could do this by the way by running the code and putting 

print statements in various places as well but the hand 

simulation is valuable so let me just start it 

what do i have here 

i need the variable ans i need x and i need ans 

times ans ans times ans 

right 

those are the three things that are involved in this 

computation and i pick something reasonably simple 


the ans starts at  

i set up x i think to be  there 

so what does the loop say 

i can either look at my flow chart or i can 

look at the code 

if i look at the flow chart it says im at this point 

look at ans squared 

is it less than or equal to sorry first of all ans 

squared is  is it less than or equal to x yes 

so what do i do 

change ans 

x doesnt change 

back around to the test 

whats ans squared 


its  

is it less than or equal to  

sure 

run the loop again 

ans becomes  

x stays  

ans squared is  

is that less than or equal to  

yes 

arent you glad i didnt pick x equals  

all right 

ans goes up by  

ans squared is nine 

still less than or equal to  

ans goes to  

x stays the same 

 squared is  

is  less than or equal to  

yes 

so ans goes to five 

ans squared becomes  

ah 

that is now no longer true here so i print out  

right 

sure 

square root of  is  

its bush economics 

ok 

i know 

im not supposed to make bad jokes like that 

what happened 

yeah 

it doesnt stop at the right place 

professor eric it doesnt stop at 

the right place 

thank you 

exactly 

right 

my bug here is right there 

ah let me find my cursor 

i probably want that 

right 

i want less than rather than less than or equal to 

this is an easy bug to come up with 


but imagine if you dont do the test youre going to get 

answers that dont make any sense 

and in fact if we just go ahead and run this now 

hopefully we get out oops sorry im going to have to 

change this quickly i still have some things uncommented at 

the bottom yeah there they are i dont think we need that 


yet all right we will comment those out 

ok 

so 

why did i do it 

its a simple example i agree but notice what i just did 

it allowed me to highlight is the code doing the right thing 

i spotted an error here i could have spotted it by 

running it on different test sets and using prints things 

another way of doing it but this idea of at least 

simulating it on simple examples lets you check a 

couple of important questions 

and in fact now let me ask those two questions about 

this piece of code 

first question is for what values of integers were 

going to assume integers but for what values of x does 

this code terminate 

and the second question is for what values of x does it give 

me back the right answer 

all right first question 

what values of x does it terminate 

again assume x is an integer 

well break it down into pieces 

suppose x is positive 

does it terminate 

sure 

all right 

because ans starts out as  so ans squared is  and 

each time through the loop ans is increasing 


that means at some point in some finite number of steps 

ans squared has got to get bigger than x if x is positive 

so for positive integers it terminates 

and it probably i think we can deduce returns 

the right answer here 

right 

x is negative 

x is  

does this code terminate 

boy i feel like arnold schwarzenegger 

does this terminate 

somebody 

unintelligible 

professor eric ah thank you so it 

does terminate right 

youre sitting too far back let me try 

oh too far sorry 

come get me one later if you cant find it 

yes it stops at the first step right 

lets look at it 

it says if answer sorry imagine x is  ans is  

is  less than  no 

so what does it do 

it prints out  

ah 

so that now answers my second question it does terminate 

but does it give me the right answer 

no 

right 

it gives me an answer and imagine im using this 

somewhere else you know its going to go off and say gee 

the square root of  is  

well it really should be a you know an imaginary number 

but this is not a valuable thing to have come back 

so thats the second thing ive just highlighted here is that
