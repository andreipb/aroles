Description
Supervised learning algorithms perform common tasks including classification, ranking, 
scoring, and probability estimation. We investigate how scoring information, often 
produced by these models, is utilized by an evaluation measure. The ROC curve 
represents a visualization of the ranking performance of classifiers. However, they 
ignore the scores which can be quite informative. While this ignored information is 
less precise than that given by probabilities, it is much more detailed than that 
conveyed by ranking. This paper presents a novel method to weight the ROC curve by 
these scores. We call it the Smooth ROC (smROC) curve, and we demonstrate how it can 
be used to visualize the performance of learning models. We report experimental results 
to show that the smROC is appropriate for measuring performance similarities and differences 
between learning models, and is more sensitive to performance characteristics than the standard ROC curve.
