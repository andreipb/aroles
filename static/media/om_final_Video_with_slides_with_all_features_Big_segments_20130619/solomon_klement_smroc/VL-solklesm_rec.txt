VL-solklesm 0.00 3.23 s0001 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TO LISTEN TO ME TALK I HOPE 
VL-solklesm 3.23 4.28 s0001 I'LL MOVE 
VL-solklesm 4.29 6.09 s0001 PROVIDE YOU WITH A LITTLE BIT OF 
VL-solklesm 6.09 8.37 s0001 THOUGHTS AND FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
VL-solklesm 8.38 11.91 s0001 THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME HERE AND EXPLAIN TO YOU 
VL-solklesm 11.92 14.98 s0001 THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS 
VL-solklesm 16.26 17.78 s0001 THIS JOINT WORK 
VL-solklesm 17.79 18.96 s0001 IS 
VL-solklesm 18.97 20.47 s0001 TECHNICALLY THE BASIS THAT 
VL-solklesm 20.48 22.23 s0001 OF MY P. H. D. THESIS 
VL-solklesm 22.24 23.47 s0001 THIS IS JUST A 
VL-solklesm 23.48 27.32 s0001 LEAVE THE FOUNDATION OF IT THERE'S MORE IN THE THESIS FROM ARIZONA TALK 
VL-solklesm 27.33 31.00 s0001 BUT ONE THING I NOTICED OF THIS WORK IS THAT IT ACTUALLY 
VL-solklesm 31.01 33.51 s0001 PROVIDED MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS 
VL-solklesm 33.52 38.12 s0001 SO THERE'S PLENTY OF APPLICATIONS PLENTY OF PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH AND I'M HOPING THAT 
VL-solklesm 38.13 39.21 s0001 AND WE CAN 
VL-solklesm 39.22 42.07 s0001 WE CAN NOW DURING THIS WEEK OF MY VISIT HERE 
VL-solklesm 42.08 44.73 s0001 WE CAN EXPLORE A LITTLE BIT OF 
VL-solklesm 44.75 46.26 s0001 THESE APPLICATIONS 
VL-solklesm 46.26 49.21 s0001 SO THIS WORK WAS DONE 
VL-solklesm 49.21 53.78 s0001 AIR IN CONJUNCTION WITH PETER FLACK NATALIE OPERATIONS THEM AT WHEN 
VL-solklesm 54.14 62.53 s0001 OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AND WE HAVE A FEW PUBLICATIONS STEMMING PROMINENT AND DEPENDING ON THE STAGE OF RESEARCH THIS IS THE MOST RECENT 
VL-solklesm 62.60 65.44 s0001 SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 65.52 68.70 s0001 FUNDAMENTALLY MY RESEARCH WORKS 
VL-solklesm 69.37 70.93 s0001 PREMISE THAT 
VL-solklesm 70.93 74.08 s0001 WHEN WE BUILD A MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM 
VL-solklesm 74.09 80.09 s0001 IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO TRY TO ASSESS ITS QUALITY IN TERMS OF EITHER PERFORMANCE 
VL-solklesm 80.09 82.21 s0001 AND HOW WE DEFINE PERFORMANCE 
VL-solklesm 82.22 83.62 s0001 AND MOST 
VL-solklesm 83.62 88.99 s0001 OF COMING TO VISIT THE APPROACH TO EVALUATION ALTOGETHER THAT'S BEEN FOLLOWED IN MACHINE LEARNING 
VL-solklesm 89.00 91.03 s0001 AND I'M GOING TO POINT OUT CERTAIN 
VL-solklesm 91.04 93.87 s0001 MISSING BITS THAT THIS RESEARCH BASICALLY 
VL-solklesm 93.87 95.00 s0001 FILLS IN 
VL-solklesm 95.00 96.07 s0001 SO 
VL-solklesm 96.08 99.52 s0001 JUST TO GIVE YOU AN OVERALL IDEA THE IDEA IS TO BRING 
VL-solklesm 99.52 101.95 s0001 CLASSIFICATION SCORES IF YOU WILL 
VL-solklesm 101.96 108.40 s0001 INTO THE R. O. C. SPACE SO TO WAIT THEY ARE OH SEE SPACE BASED ON THESE CLASS MEMBERSHIP SCORES 
VL-solklesm 108.40 110.33 s0001 AND THIS WOULD ALLOW 
VL-solklesm 110.33 114.66 s0001 US TO EXTEND THE R. O. C. TO COVER PROBLEMS THAT ARE BEYOND RANKING 
VL-solklesm 114.66 116.45 s0001 AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS 
VL-solklesm 116.46 119.16 s0001 WELL WILL ALSO YOU ALSO ALLOW US TO 
VL-solklesm 119.18 122.97 s0001 VISUALIZE INDIVIDUAL SCORES IN A TWO DIMENSIONAL PLOT 
VL-solklesm 122.97 124.17 s0001 AND 
VL-solklesm 124.17 131.52 s0001 THE PREMISE OF THIS WITH VISUALIZATION IS A COMBINATION BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCE OF RANKING CLASSIFICATION AND SCORING 
VL-solklesm 131.52 132.67 s0001 AND I'LL TELL YOU MORE 
VL-solklesm 132.68 134.66 s0001 DETAILS ABOUT WHAT SCORING MEANS 
VL-solklesm 134.66 136.32 s0001 SO TO BEGIN WITH THAT 
VL-solklesm 136.34 139.20 s0001 I'LL ACTUALLY EXAMINE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE 
VL-solklesm 139.19 140.95 s0001 FROM THE LEARNING TASK 
VL-solklesm 140.97 142.21 s0001 TO THE 
VL-solklesm 142.21 144.22 s0001 PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT 
VL-solklesm 144.59 146.76 s0001 PROCESS SO 
VL-solklesm 146.77 150.29 s0001 WHAT I WANT TO DO FIRST IS THAT UM A DEFIANT AXIS OF 
VL-solklesm 150.30 153.11 s0001 INFORMATION CONTENT SO THIS IS INFORMATION THAT 
VL-solklesm 153.12 154.69 s0001 YOU YOU BASICALLY BUILD 
VL-solklesm 154.69 156.04 s0001 MACHINE LEARNING 
VL-solklesm 156.05 157.24 s0001 MODEL 
VL-solklesm 157.25 158.38 s0001 AND YOU TESTED 
VL-solklesm 158.40 162.16 s0001 YOU TRAIN IT THEN YOU TESTED ARE VALIDATED OR DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT 
VL-solklesm 162.16 163.60 s0001 BUT THE 
VL-solklesm 163.62 167.84 s0001 PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT IS ALWAYS LIMITED BY WHAT 
VL-solklesm 167.85 169.39 s0001 THE MODEL TELLS YOU 
VL-solklesm 169.39 170.98 s0001 SO IN THE CASE OF 
VL-solklesm 170.99 172.35 s0001 CLASSIFICATION 
VL-solklesm 172.36 174.96 s0001 THE MODEL ONLY PROVIDE YOU WITH DECISIONS 
VL-solklesm 174.97 178.46 s0001 USUALLY THEY'RE BINARY DECISIONS IN BINARY CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS 
VL-solklesm 178.47 181.09 s0001 IT'S TRUE OR FALSE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE 
VL-solklesm 181.10 182.93 s0001 YOU ALSO HAVE A MORE 
VL-solklesm 182.93 187.38 s0001 CONVOLUTED NOTION OF CLASSIFICATION ABOARD NO CLASSIFICATION WHERE YOU HAVE 
VL-solklesm 187.39 189.50 s0001 CLASSES THAT SUBSUME EACH OTHER 
VL-solklesm 189.51 190.64 s0001 SOMETHING LIKE 
VL-solklesm 190.65 192.38 s0001 HIGH RISK MEDIUM RISK 
VL-solklesm 192.39 193.98 s0001 MODERATE OR MODERATE RISK 
VL-solklesm 194.00 195.31 s0001 AND THEN LOW RISK 
VL-solklesm 195.31 197.14 s0001 WHICH MEANS THAT IF YOU GET 
VL-solklesm 197.15 205.37 s0001 OF SOME SORT OF A DECISION IN THE HIGH RISK AND THEN YOU ALREADY KNOW IT'S GREATER THAN THE OTHER TWO CLASSES AND THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY ORDINARY CLASSES 
VL-solklesm 205.37 206.73 s0001 BUT NONETHELESS 
VL-solklesm 206.73 210.17 s0001 THE DECISION OUTCOME OF THIS MODEL IS A CLASSIFICATION 
VL-solklesm 210.19 211.55 s0001 IT'S BASICALLY 
VL-solklesm 211.56 215.21 s0001 YES OR NO TO MEMBERSHIP IN A PARTICULAR CLASS 
VL-solklesm 215.57 223.09 s0001 AND YOU CAN ADD MORE COMPLEXITY TO IT AND ASK FOR RANKING RANKING IS BASICALLY DETERMINING IN ORDER ON INSTANCES 
VL-solklesm 223.09 226.49 s0001 SOMEWHERE BETWEEN LIES THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN 
VL-solklesm 226.50 229.54 s0001 THE CLASS THE POSITIVE CLASS THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AND 
VL-solklesm 229.55 233.42 s0001 THE NEGATIVE CLASS AND THE NEGATIVE CLASS CAN BE COLLECTION OF CLASSES 
VL-solklesm 233.42 234.82 s0001 SO 
VL-solklesm 234.82 236.59 s0001 THESE ARE THE TRADITIONAL 
VL-solklesm 236.60 239.04 s0001 CLASSIFIERS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON 
VL-solklesm 239.04 240.61 s0001 THERE IS ONE 
VL-solklesm 241.23 244.02 s0001 AND COMPLEX VERY COMPLEX IT'S UM 
VL-solklesm 244.03 245.43 s0001 TOTALLY ON THE OTHER END 
VL-solklesm 245.43 247.83 s0001 UM TYPE OF LEARNING WHERE 
VL-solklesm 247.83 249.38 s0001 YOU NO LONGER GET A DECISION 
VL-solklesm 249.39 250.51 s0001 YOU ONLY GET UP 
VL-solklesm 250.52 256.53 s0001 PROBABILITY ESTIMATION OF CLASS MEMBERSHIP SO FOR EACH DATA POINT YOU GET SOME SORT OF A PROBABILITY 
VL-solklesm 256.52 259.20 s0001 OF OF BELONGING TO PARTICULAR CLASS 
VL-solklesm 259.20 261.27 s0001 AND ON THAT END OF THE SPECTRUM 
VL-solklesm 261.27 264.40 s0001 THERE'S PLENTY OF STATISTICAL METHODS THAT ACTUALLY 
VL-solklesm 264.42 268.23 s0001 CAN ASSESS THE QUALITY OF THESE PROBABILITIES AND HOW WELL THEY MAP 
VL-solklesm 268.23 269.69 s0001 INTO THE DOMAIN 
VL-solklesm 269.70 271.00 s0001 CLASSES 
VL-solklesm 271.01 273.98 s0001 THE PROBLEM OVER THERE IS THAT MOST OF THE METHODS THAT 
VL-solklesm 273.99 276.60 s0001 APPLY STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TO IT 
VL-solklesm 276.61 277.88 s0001 THEY EITHER MAKE ASSUMPTIONS 
VL-solklesm 277.89 281.34 s0001 OR THEY'RE VERY RESTRICTIVE IN TERMS OF WHAT IT IS YOU 
VL-solklesm 281.36 282.71 s0001 YOU CAN OR CANNOT 
VL-solklesm 282.72 284.17 s0001 DO IN TERMS OF PREFER 
VL-solklesm 284.18 285.56 s0001 PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT 
VL-solklesm 285.56 288.04 s0001 AND WHEN I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 288.05 289.22 s0001 I'M TRYING 
VL-solklesm 289.23 292.01 s0001 TO TAKE CONCEPTS THAT ARE USED 
VL-solklesm 292.02 294.91 s0001 IN THE CONTEXT OF PROBABILITY ESTIMATION 
VL-solklesm 295.11 299.13 s0001 AND WATERED AND DOWN A LITTLE BIT TO SEE WHAT I CAN DO WITH 
VL-solklesm 299.14 300.95 s0001 SCORES IN GENERAL 
VL-solklesm 300.95 303.12 s0001 SCORES THAT I'M LOOKING AT 
VL-solklesm 303.12 305.80 s0001 OUR SCORES THAT FOR SOME REASON 
VL-solklesm 305.81 308.43 s0001 THEY DID NOT MAKE IT INTO PROBABILITY 
VL-solklesm 308.44 312.20 s0001 AND IT'S VERY WELL KNOWN THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A PROBABILISTIC 
VL-solklesm 312.20 314.95 s0001 MODEL THAT PRODUCES PROBABILITIES 
VL-solklesm 314.95 317.02 s0001 BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY A GOOD ESTIMATE OF 
VL-solklesm 317.02 323.61 s0001 PROBABILITIES THEY'RE VERY POOR IN THE PERFECT EXAMPLE WOULD BE NAIVE BASE CLASS FIRED A BASE CLASS FIRE IS A VERY GOOD CLASS 
VL-solklesm 323.63 324.85 s0001 CLASS FIRE 
VL-solklesm 324.85 327.46 s0001 ON THE CLASSIFICATION AND OF THINGS RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 327.45 328.79 s0001 BUT DISCORD THAT IT 
VL-solklesm 328.81 329.86 s0001 PRODUCES 
VL-solklesm 329.87 332.12 s0001 ARE VERY POORLY ESTIMATED 
VL-solklesm 332.12 338.15 s0001 AND THE EASIEST WAY TO CHECK THESE THINGS IT'S A CHECK THE CALIBRATION OF THESE COURSE IT'S ALWAYS POOR 
VL-solklesm 338.16 339.83 s0001 OR AS THE YEAR 
VL-solklesm 339.84 341.83 s0001 NINE BASED ESTIMATES THEM BUT 
VL-solklesm 341.84 344.95 s0001 IF YOU TAKE SOMETHING LIKE A PROBABILITY ESTIMATING TREES 
VL-solklesm 344.95 349.85 s0001 PROBABILITY ESTIMATING TREES ARE DECISION TREES THAT ARE UNPROVEN AND SCHOOLS 
VL-solklesm 349.85 352.16 s0001 THOSE PRODUCE VERY GOOD 
VL-solklesm 352.17 354.62 s0001 PROBABILITY SCORES BECAUSE WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO 
VL-solklesm 354.63 356.25 s0001 IS IN THIS MOOD DISCORD 
VL-solklesm 356.26 358.05 s0001 IT'S ACROSS THE DISTRIBUTION 
VL-solklesm 358.05 359.39 s0001 AND THEREFORE 
VL-solklesm 359.39 363.34 s0001 THEY MATCH WHAT'S CALLED THE CONVEX HULL OF D. R. O. C. AND THEY GIVE YOU 
VL-solklesm 363.35 364.99 s0001 CALIBRATE ITS COURSE 
VL-solklesm 365.00 366.99 s0001 AND THEIR VIEW TO BE WELL BEHAVE 
VL-solklesm 366.99 368.18 s0001 PROBABILITIES 
VL-solklesm 368.18 371.68 s0001 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE NOT GOOD FOR CLASSIFICATION 
VL-solklesm 371.69 374.29 s0001 THERE'S PLENTY RESEARCH THERE AND I'M ACTUALLY 
VL-solklesm 374.30 376.68 s0001 EXPLOITING THAT FACT IN MY EXPERIMENTS 
VL-solklesm 376.69 379.55 s0001 TO SHOW THAT I CAN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THE MIDDLE 
VL-solklesm 379.56 381.54 s0001 IN THE MIDDLE WHAT DO WE DO 
VL-solklesm 382.40 394.26 s0001 THE PROBLEM THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS IN TERMS OF SUPERVISED LEARNING IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A SCORING CROSSFIRE WHETHER BE PROBABILITIES ARE NOT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER YOU HAVE SCORES AND BASED ON THOSE COURSE YOU NEED TO 
VL-solklesm 394.27 398.81 s0001 MAKE A DECISION WHETHER A GIVEN DATA POINT BELONGS TO A GIVEN CLASS OR NOT 
VL-solklesm 398.81 400.70 s0001 AND WHAT TRADITIONALLY HAPPENS IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 400.71 403.54 s0001 MOST PEOPLE IMPOSE A CLASSIFICATION THRESHOLD 
VL-solklesm 403.55 405.99 s0001 TO DETERMINE WHAT THE DECISION IS 
VL-solklesm 405.99 408.17 s0001 NOW THAT PROBLEM 
VL-solklesm 408.75 410.41 s0001 THAT APPROACH 
VL-solklesm 410.41 412.05 s0001 REDUCES THE PROBLEM 
VL-solklesm 412.06 413.57 s0001 TWO RANKING 
VL-solklesm 413.71 415.76 s0001 AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 415.76 418.92 s0001 I CLAIM THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY MISSING SOME INFORMATION 
VL-solklesm 418.93 421.86 s0001 AND THE PERFECT EXAMPLE TO ILLUSTRATE THAT WOULD BE 
VL-solklesm 421.86 425.01 s0001 CONSIDER A THRESHOLD VALUE OF ZERO POINT FIVE 
VL-solklesm 425.02 427.65 s0001 AND THEN YOU HAVE TO POSITIVE EXAMPLES 
VL-solklesm 427.65 429.40 s0001 ONE MAKES IT AT FIFTY TWO 
VL-solklesm 429.41 431.50 s0001 THE OTHER ONE MAKES IT AT NINETY NINE 
VL-solklesm 431.50 439.22 s0001 INTERVIEWER BANKING OUR CLASS PICK EIGHT IN THE VIEW OF CLASSIFICATION YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO POINTS 
VL-solklesm 439.23 444.16 s0001 THEY'RE EQUALLY POSITIVE THEY'RE BOTH ABOVE THE THRESHOLD AND YOU KNOW NO FURTHER INFORMATION 
VL-solklesm 444.17 445.29 s0001 SO WHEN YOU GO TO THE 
VL-solklesm 445.30 446.46 s0001 FOR MIZ ASSESSMENT 
VL-solklesm 446.47 447.76 s0001 TABLES LOOK THE SAME 
VL-solklesm 447.77 449.45 s0001 YOU CANNOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEM 
VL-solklesm 449.45 450.68 s0001 WHEREAS 
VL-solklesm 450.69 452.16 s0001 IF YOU LOOK AT THE RANKING 
VL-solklesm 452.17 455.27 s0001 ALL YOU KNOW IS THAT ONE COMES BEFORE THE OTHER 
VL-solklesm 455.27 457.39 s0001 BUT HOW FAR ABOVE AND HOW 
VL-solklesm 457.40 461.47 s0001 HOW CLOSE TO WITH YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MARGINAL 
VL-solklesm 461.48 464.36 s0001 DISTANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO RANKS 
VL-solklesm 464.36 465.13 s0031 YES 
VL-solklesm 465.87 467.63 s0031 OH REALLY 
VL-solklesm 468.62 470.60 s0031 THE ONES THEY SWOOP YOU ARE RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 470.60 471.13 s0001 THE 
VL-solklesm 473.89 475.76 s0001 SCORING IS A BIG 
VL-solklesm 475.77 476.91 s0001 MORE THAN RANKING 
VL-solklesm 476.93 478.92 s0001 HE SEES RANKING IS JUST AN ORDER 
VL-solklesm 478.93 480.84 s0001 OH YEAH RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 480.99 483.46 s0001 WOULD EXACTLY SO 
VL-solklesm 483.46 486.57 s0001 ONCE YES ONCE YOU HAVE 
VL-solklesm 486.57 488.21 s0001 ONCE YOU HAVE A SCORE 
VL-solklesm 488.22 490.11 s0001 YOU CAN EASILY DETERMINE A RANK 
VL-solklesm 490.12 491.39 s0001 YOU JUST SORT THEM 
VL-solklesm 491.39 492.58 s0001 AND GO FROM THERE 
VL-solklesm 492.58 495.76 s0001 BUT THIS COURSE TELL YOU SLIGHTLY MORE THAN JUST A RANK 
VL-solklesm 495.77 498.35 s0001 THEY MAY TELL YOU ABOUT GAPS IN BETWEEN 
VL-solklesm 498.36 501.07 s0001 SO THE PERFECT EXAMPLE WOULD BE SEARCH ENGINES 
VL-solklesm 501.08 503.54 s0001 WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR RELEVANT DOCUMENTS RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 503.55 505.88 s0001 YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN THE FACT THAT 
VL-solklesm 505.88 509.19 s0001 MAYBE THE TOP TEN ARE SEPARATED BY MAYBE 
VL-solklesm 509.20 512.61 s0001 ONE PERCENT BUT THEN THERE'S A GAP OF TEN PERCENT OF THE NEXT GUY 
VL-solklesm 512.62 515.62 s0001 IT WOULD BE NATURAL TO MAKE THAT CUT OFF THERE 
VL-solklesm 515.63 517.80 s0001 SO THAT YOU CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN 
VL-solklesm 517.82 521.94 s0001 CLUSTERS OF RELEVANT DOCUMENTS THINGS THAT ARE MORE RELEVANT THAN THE OTHERS 
VL-solklesm 521.95 525.15 s0001 WAS RANKING YOU DON'T KNOW THAT ALL YOU KNOW IS THE ORDER FROM THE TOP 
VL-solklesm 525.15 526.86 s0001 AND THAT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE WOULD 
VL-solklesm 526.87 527.91 s0001 IMPOSE 
VL-solklesm 527.91 529.16 s0001 THE TOP END 
VL-solklesm 529.16 530.66 s0001 OPTIONS RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 530.67 535.14 s0001 SCORING ACTUALLY TELLS YOU THAT MUCH MORE INFORMATION AT A HIGHER RESOLUTION 
VL-solklesm 535.14 538.36 s0001 AND THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO EXPLOIT THAT IN THE 
VL-solklesm 538.36 540.07 s0001 PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT 
VL-solklesm 540.07 542.16 s0001 SO WHAT ARE THE MOTIVATION 
VL-solklesm 542.16 543.82 s0001 THE IDEA HERE IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 543.83 545.44 s0001 I WILL NOW SO 
VL-solklesm 545.45 548.26 s0001 ONE WAY OF VIEWING BE SCORES IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 548.26 554.71 s0001 BIG BE CLASSIFY OR PROVIDE ESCORT TO TELL YOU HOW CONFIDENT IT IS IN ITS PREDICTION FOR A GIVEN 
VL-solklesm 554.72 556.07 s0001 DATA POINT 
VL-solklesm 556.08 561.27 s0001 SO THE B. POINT THAT WAS CLASSIFIED AS AS POSITIVE AT NINETY NINE PERCENT 
VL-solklesm 561.28 564.70 s0001 IS FAR MORE CONFIDENT THERE'S MORE CONFIDENCE IN IT 
VL-solklesm 564.72 566.36 s0001 THEN THE ONE AT FIFTY TWO PERCENT 
VL-solklesm 566.37 568.66 s0001 ALTHOUGH BOTH OF THEM MADE ABOVE THIS THRESHOLD 
VL-solklesm 568.66 571.80 s0001 AND I AM USING ZERO POINT FIVE AS AN EXAMPLE HERE 
VL-solklesm 571.82 575.13 s0001 WHICH IS THE NATURAL CUTOFF FOR CALIBRATED SCORES RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 575.14 577.68 s0001 IF THEY'RE NOT CALIBRATED IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY 
VL-solklesm 577.70 579.55 s0001 BUT THE IDEA HERE IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 579.54 585.93 s0001 THE CLASS FIRE IS TELLING ME TWO THINGS IT'S TELLING ME WHAT THE DECISION IS AND IT'S GIVEN ME SOME SORT OF A 
VL-solklesm 585.94 588.59 s0001 VALUE OF CONFIDENCE RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 588.59 590.92 s0001 IN THE TRADITIONAL R. O. C. CURVE 
VL-solklesm 590.92 592.80 s0001 THIS CONFIDENCE IS THROWN AWAY 
VL-solklesm 592.82 595.20 s0001 IT'S ONLY USED TO DETERMINE A RANKING 
VL-solklesm 595.21 597.28 s0001 AND THEN IT'S IGNORED COMPLETELY 
VL-solklesm 597.29 601.41 s0001 SO MY AIM HERE IS TO TAKE THAT MAGNITUDE AND BRING IT BACK 
VL-solklesm 601.42 602.67 s0001 INTO THE R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 602.67 604.44 s0001 NOW YOU COULD EASILY ARGUE 
VL-solklesm 604.45 607.16 s0001 AT P. R. O. C. CURVES WERE DEVELOPED 
VL-solklesm 607.94 610.84 s0001 IGNORED THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF SCORING 
VL-solklesm 610.85 612.83 s0001 BECAUSE THEY WERE DESIGNED TO 
VL-solklesm 613.57 615.87 s0001 CONVEY THE PERFORMANCE OF RANKING 
VL-solklesm 615.88 617.32 s0001 THAT IS VERY TRUE 
VL-solklesm 617.48 622.45 s0001 BUT IT'S ALSO PLUS FOR ME IF YOU LOOK AT IT THE OTHER WAY I'M INTERESTED IN THIS COURSE 
VL-solklesm 622.46 623.85 s0001 WHILE PRESERVING 
VL-solklesm 623.86 625.24 s0001 THE PERFORMANCE OF RANKING 
VL-solklesm 625.24 627.27 s0001 SO I CAN COMBINE THEM TOGETHER 
VL-solklesm 627.28 630.44 s0001 WHAT DOES THAT ALLOW ME TO DO WELL IT NOW ALLOWS ME 
VL-solklesm 630.45 634.95 s0001 TO VISUALIZE THE MARGINS OF THESE COURSE I CAN NOW COMPARE VISUALLY 
VL-solklesm 634.95 637.33 s0001 THE DIFFERENCES OF DISCOURSE 
VL-solklesm 637.33 639.21 s0001 I COULD LOOK FOR GAPS 
VL-solklesm 639.22 643.13 s0001 I LOOK I COULD LOOK FOR A CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR SOMEWHERE IN THE DATA POINTS 
VL-solklesm 643.13 644.62 s0001 AND NOW IF I MAY 
VL-solklesm 644.63 647.73 s0001 APPROACH THE SAME PROBLEM BUT FROM THE OTHER END 
VL-solklesm 647.86 649.61 s0001 I'M NO LONGER MAYBE 
VL-solklesm 649.61 651.98 s0001 I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THE MODEL ITSELF 
VL-solklesm 651.98 654.73 s0001 YOU SEE TRADITIONALLY PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT 
VL-solklesm 654.74 657.59 s0001 IS USED TO ANSWER ONE COMMON QUESTION IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 657.59 663.02 s0001 WHICH OF THE MODELS IS THE BEST PERFORMING MODELS SO IT'S A MODEL SELECTION PROBLEM RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 663.05 669.25 s0001 IMAGINE YOU HAVE A GOOD MODEL THAT SAY WE'RE NOT CRITICISING THE MODEL HERE BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ASK IS 
VL-solklesm 669.25 671.69 s0001 HOW GOOD ARE THE DATA POINTS 
VL-solklesm 672.29 675.06 s0001 IF I HAVE DATA POINTS THAT RANK 
VL-solklesm 675.06 676.73 s0001 CLOSE TO EACH OTHER 
VL-solklesm 676.74 679.42 s0001 HOW DO I KNOW THAT THEY'RE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER 
VL-solklesm 679.42 684.36 s0001 BECAUSE THEY ARE INDEED CLOSE TO EACH OTHER OR BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN OBSERVED ANYTHING BETWEEN THEM 
VL-solklesm 684.98 691.31 s0001 AND THAT RELATES TO THE METHOD OF SAMPLING THE DATA HOW DO YOU COLLECT YOUR SAMPLES DO YOU REALLY HAVE 
VL-solklesm 691.32 692.55 s0001 IS YOUR DATA 
VL-solklesm 692.56 693.68 s0001 REPRESENTATIVE 
VL-solklesm 693.69 696.49 s0001 OF THE SPACE BETWEEN THESE TWO POINTS RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 696.49 703.25 s0001 SO IN A SENSE THAT I'M NOW COMPARING THE DATA POINTS NOT THE MODELS THEMSELVES OR MAYBE AS WELL AS THE MODELS AND 
VL-solklesm 703.26 704.35 s0001 SO 
VL-solklesm 704.36 708.61 s0001 WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY HERE IS THAT I'M DEALING WITH SCORES THERE ARE 
VL-solklesm 708.61 710.24 s0001 LOOSELY DEFINED 
VL-solklesm 710.31 716.95 s0001 THEY'RE NOT AS STRINGENT AND RESTRICTIVE AS PROBABILITIES BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO LOOSEN UP SOME ASSUMPTIONS HERE RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 717.68 719.83 s0001 THE MODELS PRODUCE COURSE 
VL-solklesm 719.85 721.43 s0001 IN FACT IF YOU TAKE QUICKER 
VL-solklesm 721.44 722.58 s0001 AND YOU RUN IT 
VL-solklesm 722.59 724.12 s0001 IT'S BY DEFAULT 
VL-solklesm 724.13 725.37 s0001 THE SCORE IS CALLED 
VL-solklesm 725.38 728.21 s0001 CLASS A CLASS MEMBERSHIP PROBABILITIES 
VL-solklesm 728.21 729.69 s0001 ALTHOUGH I CAN IT 
VL-solklesm 729.70 730.76 s0001 POINT OUT TO HOW 
VL-solklesm 730.77 732.36 s0001 DOZEN MODELS THAT ARE 
VL-solklesm 732.37 734.26 s0001 MEMBER WERE NEVER DESIGNED 
VL-solklesm 734.27 736.11 s0001 TO PRODUCE PROBABILITIES 
VL-solklesm 736.12 739.03 s0001 BUT THEY CALL THEM PROBABILITIES ANYWAYS THERE PORK ROAST 
VL-solklesm 739.03 740.14 s0001 PROBABILITIES 
VL-solklesm 740.15 745.19 s0001 SO NOW I'M TRYING TO ADDRESS THE POOR PROBABILITY ESTIMATION BY USING THESE SCORES 
VL-solklesm 745.20 746.76 s0001 APPLICATION TO THIS 
VL-solklesm 746.77 754.09 s0001 THE FIRST ONE THAT HE THAT IS VERY INTUITIVE IS USER PREFERENCES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT INVOLVES TWO TYPES 
VL-solklesm 754.39 756.99 s0001 I WOULD COME WHEN YOU HAVE A BINARY DECISION 
VL-solklesm 757.00 758.62 s0001 AND A SCORE THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT 
VL-solklesm 758.63 761.92 s0001 OR MAYBE ASSESSING THE REDLANDS A BEER 
VL-solklesm 761.93 763.95 s0001 RELEVANCE 
VL-solklesm 763.96 766.19 s0001 OF RETRIEVED DOCUMENTS OR 
VL-solklesm 766.20 769.01 s0001 RETRIEVE RESULTS OF A QUERY IN A SEARCH ENGINE 
VL-solklesm 769.01 772.09 s0001 AND ALSO CORY CORTES AT I. C. M. L. 
VL-solklesm 772.10 773.49 s0001 AH OH SEVEN 
VL-solklesm 773.50 774.54 s0001 I MET UP WITH HER 
VL-solklesm 774.55 776.57 s0001 AND SHE HAD AN INTERESTING LEARNING PROBLEM 
VL-solklesm 776.58 778.38 s0001 SHE HAD A LEARNING PROBLEM WHERE 
VL-solklesm 778.39 782.29 s0001 THE OUTCOME OF THE LEARNING WAS NO LONGER THE DECISION BUT THE ORDER 
VL-solklesm 782.84 784.75 s0001 SHE WANTED TO LEARN 
VL-solklesm 784.76 788.27 s0001 THE DISTANCE BETWEEN POINTS IN A GIVEN DATA 
VL-solklesm 788.28 791.03 s0001 NOT PARTICULARLY THE DECISION SO SHE WANTED 
VL-solklesm 791.03 793.78 s0001 THAT YOU GIVE THIS BOTTLE A PARTICULAR DATA SAID 
VL-solklesm 793.79 795.53 s0001 AND HE WOULD PRODUCE EXACTLY 
VL-solklesm 795.54 797.06 s0001 SIMILAR ORDERING 
VL-solklesm 797.06 798.41 s0001 TO THE TRAINING SET 
VL-solklesm 798.41 800.70 s0001 AND IN THIS CASE SHE HAD TROUBLE 
VL-solklesm 800.70 806.12 s0001 EVALUATING IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT IS SENSITIVE TO THE GAPS OR DISTANCES BETWEEN POINTS 
VL-solklesm 806.13 808.43 s0001 AND THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE PERFECT APPLICATION PORT 
VL-solklesm 808.43 811.34 s0001 UM ANOTHER SAYING ALSO I'D LIKE TO 
VL-solklesm 811.35 815.35 s0001 SOMEHOW LOOK BACKWARDS AND THE RESEARCH WE'VE BEEN DOING IN MACHINE LEARNING 
VL-solklesm 815.36 820.22 s0001 IT'S BEEN VERY WELL DOCUMENTED THAT PROBABILITY ESTIMATING TREES ARE BE 
VL-solklesm 820.22 821.85 s0001 BE THE BEST 
VL-solklesm 821.85 826.56 s0001 PROBABILITY ESTIMATING MODELS THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE CALIBRATED PROBABILITIES 
VL-solklesm 826.57 827.96 s0001 DECISION TREES ON THE OTHER 
VL-solklesm 827.97 832.23 s0001 AND ARE VERY POOR AT ESTIMATING PROBABILITIES BECAUSE THEY'RE PRUNED INMATE 
VL-solklesm 832.24 833.72 s0001 AND THEY GIVE YOU THE VERY 
VL-solklesm 833.72 835.34 s0001 WHAT'S CALLED THE REFINED 
VL-solklesm 835.35 838.28 s0001 THEY GIVE YOU CLOSE TO ZERO CLOSE TO ONE AND NOTHING IN BETWEEN 
VL-solklesm 838.29 843.56 s0001 NINE A BASE IS VERY WELL KNOWN TO BE INEFFECTIVE CLASS FIRE BUT A VERY POOR PROBABILITY ESTIMATE OR 
VL-solklesm 843.56 846.58 s0001 THIS WORK HAS BEEN DONE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS 
VL-solklesm 846.60 848.17 s0001 BY HAND LABOUR 
VL-solklesm 848.18 849.43 s0001 EVERYBODY HAD TO 
VL-solklesm 849.44 855.22 s0001 THEY NOTICED THIS PROBLEM WITH THESE THREE MODELS AND THEY EXPERIMENTED WITH EACH ONE OF THEM AND THERE'S HAPPEN DOESN'T DOCUMENTS 
VL-solklesm 855.22 856.38 s0001 THE PAPERS 
VL-solklesm 856.38 858.17 s0001 ILLUSTRATING THIS PROBLEM 
VL-solklesm 858.17 862.99 s0001 FUNNY THING IS THAT IF THIS TOO WAS AVAILABLE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ONE ONE EXPERIMENT ON THE THREE OF THEM 
VL-solklesm 863.00 867.45 s0001 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO VISUALLY SEE IT RIGHT THERE AND WE'LL SEE THAT IN MY A 
VL-solklesm 867.45 869.05 s0001 RESULTS 
VL-solklesm 869.17 874.33 s0001 THE OTHER THING ALSO I I COULD APPLY THIS TOO IS GENE EXPRESSION LEVELS WHERE GIVEN 
VL-solklesm 874.35 876.07 s0001 AND GENE COULD BE 
VL-solklesm 876.08 881.07 s0001 COULD BE UP REGULATED OR DOWN REGULATED AT A PARTICULAR INTENSITY OF EXPRESSION 
VL-solklesm 881.08 884.23 s0001 BASICALLY THIS METHOD REQUIRES THAT YOU HAVE A BINARY DECISION 
VL-solklesm 884.23 886.40 s0001 AND YOU HAVE THE CONTINUOUS 
VL-solklesm 886.41 889.18 s0001 VALUE SCORE ALONG WITH IT AND THE QUESTION IS 
VL-solklesm 889.19 890.72 s0001 DO THESE TO AGREE 
VL-solklesm 890.73 891.78 s0001 OR NOT 
VL-solklesm 891.79 893.69 s0001 AND THAT'S WHAT I TRY TO CONVEY 
VL-solklesm 893.69 894.75 s0001 SO HERE'S A 
VL-solklesm 894.76 896.30 s0001 SIMPLE EXAMPLE 
VL-solklesm 896.47 898.37 s0001 RIGHT SO MY NIECE AND NEPHEW 
VL-solklesm 898.38 899.82 s0001 DECIDED TO PLAY WITH ME 
VL-solklesm 899.82 904.58 s0001 RIGHT THEY GOT BORED OF ME WORKING ALL THE TIME SO I DECIDED TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING INTERESTING TO PLAY WITH 
VL-solklesm 904.59 906.83 s0001 I GAVE HIM A COLLECTION OF MOVIES 
VL-solklesm 906.83 908.22 s0001 MOVIES THEY LIKE 
VL-solklesm 908.23 909.66 s0001 AND I ASKED THEM 
VL-solklesm 910.54 915.12 s0001 TWO QUESTIONS NUMBER ONE DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT I WATCHED THIS MOVIE 
VL-solklesm 915.13 916.24 s0001 YES OR NO 
VL-solklesm 916.24 918.12 s0001 AND IT'S SO TELL ME 
VL-solklesm 918.13 919.51 s0001 HOW WELL ON IT SO BUT 
VL-solklesm 919.52 922.10 s0001 TELL ME HOW MUCH YOU LIKE IT ON A SCALE 
VL-solklesm 922.11 923.43 s0001 FROM ZERO TO TEN 
VL-solklesm 923.44 924.52 s0001 TEN BEING 
VL-solklesm 924.52 927.24 s0001 I LIKE IT VERY MUCH ZERO I DISLIKE 
VL-solklesm 927.25 930.14 s0001 AND THE FUNNY THING WITH THIS PROBLEM IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 930.83 932.72 s0001 SHE MIGHT 
VL-solklesm 932.84 935.41 s0001 JUST AS AN EXAMPLE SHE MIGHT GIVE ME 
VL-solklesm 935.42 937.47 s0001 A PARTICULAR MOVIE AND SAYS 
VL-solklesm 937.49 938.81 s0001 DON'T WATCH IT 
VL-solklesm 938.81 941.70 s0001 BUT I'LL GIVE IT A SIXTY PERCENT SCORE I LIKE IT 
VL-solklesm 941.79 943.95 s0001 RIGHT SO THE FACT THAT SHE 
VL-solklesm 943.97 946.59 s0001 SHE MADE A NEGATIVE RECOMMENDATION 
VL-solklesm 946.60 951.62 s0001 MAY NOT NECESSARILY CORRESPOND TO THE FACT THAT SHE LIKED IT OR NOT YOU MAY HAVE A REASON RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 951.63 952.86 s0001 ON THE OTHER HAND 
VL-solklesm 952.86 956.95 s0001 HE COMES IN AND HE SAYS WATCH THIS MOVIE BUT I REALLY DON'T LIKE IT 
VL-solklesm 957.54 961.19 s0001 NOW MY QUESTION IS THAT DO THEY AGREE OR DISAGREE 
VL-solklesm 961.44 963.84 s0001 IF WE TAKE THEIR DECISIONS ALONE 
VL-solklesm 963.85 965.24 s0001 FORGET ABOUT THE SCORES 
VL-solklesm 965.24 966.38 s0001 WE SEE THAT 
VL-solklesm 966.39 967.43 s0001 THEY DISAGREE 
VL-solklesm 967.44 970.35 s0001 AND THE SAME THING BUT IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION 
VL-solklesm 970.35 971.56 s0001 WILL SAY THAT SHE GAVE 
VL-solklesm 971.57 972.62 s0001 THE SAME MOVIE AH HA 
VL-solklesm 972.63 973.99 s0001 HIGHER SCORED THAN HE DID 
VL-solklesm 974.00 977.03 s0001 HE GAVE IT MAYBE A FIFTY TWO INSTEAD OF SIXTY 
VL-solklesm 977.12 978.57 s0001 AND 
VL-solklesm 978.58 979.78 s0001 THE QUESTION HERE 
VL-solklesm 979.79 982.23 s0001 IS THAT DO THEY REALLY DISAGREE 
VL-solklesm 982.24 985.72 s0001 MY CLAIM IS THAT NO THEY DON'T DISAGREE 
VL-solklesm 985.72 987.44 s0001 THEY IN FACT THEY DO AGREE 
VL-solklesm 987.45 989.05 s0001 IN THE FACT THAT THEY SAY 
VL-solklesm 989.05 991.79 s0001 THE MOVIE IS NOT REALLY THE GREATEST MOVIE 
VL-solklesm 991.80 993.81 s0001 BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD WATCH IT 
VL-solklesm 993.82 995.45 s0001 OR MAYBE SHOULDN'T WATCH 
VL-solklesm 996.15 998.89 s0001 SO THERE IS SOME SORT OF HESITATION 
VL-solklesm 998.90 1002.00 s0001 THAT MAY BE CAPTURED IN THE COMBINATION OF 
VL-solklesm 1002.01 1003.72 s0001 THE SCORE AND THE DECISION 
VL-solklesm 1003.73 1005.23 s0001 BUT NOT NECESSARILY WOULD 
VL-solklesm 1005.24 1007.11 s0001 EACH OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY 
VL-solklesm 1007.12 1009.15 s0001 SO IN THIS CASE 
VL-solklesm 1009.15 1011.98 s0001 I GO TO ANALYSE GET HER DECISION 
VL-solklesm 1011.98 1015.44 s0001 RECOMMEND WHICH IS A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE RECOMMENDATION 
VL-solklesm 1015.45 1022.04 s0001 AND THE PARTICULAR SCORE OF HOW WELL SHE LIKES PARTICULAR MOVIE AND THE SITUATION I WAS DESCRIBING IS INSTANCE THREE IN FOUR 
VL-solklesm 1022.23 1023.63 s0001 AND THEN I THOUGHT 
VL-solklesm 1023.64 1024.68 s0001 A CURVE 
VL-solklesm 1024.69 1030.03 s0001 FOR WHAT SHE SAYS AND THEN I THOUGHT OCCUR FOR WHAT HE SAYS AND THEN I COMPARED THE TWO CURVES TO SEE 
VL-solklesm 1030.04 1032.46 s0001 WHETHER THEY'RE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER OR NOT 
VL-solklesm 1032.47 1034.25 s0001 IN THE R. O. C. SPACE 
VL-solklesm 1034.25 1036.95 s0001 THAT PICTURE DOES NOT ARRIVE HERE AT ALL 
VL-solklesm 1036.95 1041.65 s0001 IN FACT THAT PICTURE WOULD LOOK ALMOST IDENTICAL FOR BOTH OF THEM IF THEY WERE SOMEONE 
VL-solklesm 1041.66 1043.99 s0001 IN AGREEMENT RIGHT WILL SAY THAT THEY ARE 
VL-solklesm 1044.00 1046.42 s0001 YOU WILL TELL GAPS IN BETWEEN 
VL-solklesm 1046.43 1047.77 s0001 SO LET'S TAKE 
VL-solklesm 1047.78 1049.06 s0001 ONE 
VL-solklesm 1049.06 1051.07 s0001 PREFERENCE PERSON 
VL-solklesm 1051.32 1054.37 s0001 WE HAVE TWO POSITIVES FOLLOWED BY AND NEGATIVE 
VL-solklesm 1054.39 1055.97 s0001 THEN A POSITIVE M. AND 
VL-solklesm 1055.98 1057.33 s0001 WITH TWO NEGATIVES 
VL-solklesm 1057.34 1062.44 s0001 AND THE R. O. C. SPACE A POSITIVE IS ALWAYS INDICATED BY A VERTICAL LINE SEGMENT QUITE SO 
VL-solklesm 1062.46 1064.52 s0001 YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FROM THE TOP RANK 
VL-solklesm 1064.53 1065.73 s0001 TO THE BOTTOM RANK 
VL-solklesm 1065.73 1068.99 s0001 A SEQUENCE OF INSTANCES A LONG THEY ARE A SEEKER 
VL-solklesm 1068.99 1071.96 s0001 THE FIRST TWO ARE POSITIVE SO THEY'RE VERY VERTICAL 
VL-solklesm 1071.96 1073.75 s0001 THEN FOLLOWED BY A NEGATIVE 
VL-solklesm 1073.75 1076.65 s0001 AND THEN A POSITIVE AND THEN TWO NEGATIVES 
VL-solklesm 1077.01 1079.35 s0001 THAT'S THE WAY HOW YOU PLOT A NARROW SEEKER 
VL-solklesm 1079.35 1081.29 s0001 THE FUNNY THING IN THE R. O. C.S THAT 
VL-solklesm 1081.30 1082.90 s0001 BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS NEGATIVE 
VL-solklesm 1082.92 1084.19 s0001 AND THIS POSITIVE 
VL-solklesm 1084.20 1086.55 s0001 YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW MUCH SO YOU CAN ADD 
VL-solklesm 1086.56 1087.77 s0001 THE DIAGONAL LINE 
VL-solklesm 1087.78 1089.46 s0001 AT THE ZERO POINT FIVE 
VL-solklesm 1089.46 1090.85 s0001 BOUNDARY BECAUSE 
VL-solklesm 1090.84 1093.12 s0001 THEY'RE EQUAL THERE'S ONE NEGATIVE 
VL-solklesm 1093.14 1094.98 s0001 FOLLOWED BY ONE POSITIVE 
VL-solklesm 1094.98 1097.75 s0001 SO THIS SHOWS YOU JUST THE BRAKES RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1097.75 1098.86 s0001 FUNNY THING IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 1098.88 1102.14 s0001 I CAN NO LONGER TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO 
VL-solklesm 1102.95 1105.75 s0001 AS FAR AS THEY ARE OH SEE CURVE IS CONCERNED 
VL-solklesm 1105.76 1107.24 s0001 IF I WERE TO SWAP 
VL-solklesm 1107.25 1109.69 s0001 THESE TWO INSTANCES IN IN DIFFERENT RANK 
VL-solklesm 1109.70 1111.37 s0001 THEY WOULD STILL LOOK THE SAME 
VL-solklesm 1111.36 1113.26 s0001 BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1113.27 1115.34 s0001 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SCORE LOOKS LIKE 
VL-solklesm 1115.34 1116.89 s0001 EVEN WORSE 
VL-solklesm 1116.91 1122.23 s0001 SOMEWHERE HERE WHERE I CONCLUDE IS ZERO POINT FIVE SLOPE OF I DON'T KNOW ALL 
VL-solklesm 1122.23 1125.62 s0001 ASSUMES THAT THIS IS ZERO POINT FIVE SENSES THEIR POINT FIVE 
VL-solklesm 1125.63 1126.87 s0001 THEY'RE OF EQUAL WEIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1126.88 1128.35 s0001 BUT IF WE LOOK AT THEM 
VL-solklesm 1128.35 1130.07 s0001 THEY ACTUALLY HAVE DIFFERENT SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1130.08 1135.72 s0001 THE SCORES ARE TELLING YOU SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THESE TWO INSTANCES ARE THESE TWO INSTANCES 
VL-solklesm 1135.73 1137.34 s0001 THEN THE R. O. C. DOES 
VL-solklesm 1137.35 1141.30 s0001 SO THIS IS WHAT I CALL MISSING INFORMATION FROM THE RANKING PROBLEM 
VL-solklesm 1141.31 1144.73 s0001 THE RANKING PROBLEM ONLY TELLS YOU THE ORDER OF HOW THEY COME 
VL-solklesm 1144.74 1147.41 s0001 BUT THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU BUT DISTANCES IN BETWEEN RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1147.42 1150.14 s0001 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT APPARENTLY AND I WAS MORE 
VL-solklesm 1150.14 1151.23 s0001 CONFIDENT 
VL-solklesm 1151.23 1153.70 s0001 IN THAT NEGATIVE BEEN A POSITIVE 
VL-solklesm 1153.71 1156.20 s0001 THEN THE FOLLOWING POSITIVE 
VL-solklesm 1156.80 1158.98 s0001 SHE GAVE IT A SIXTY PERCENT 
VL-solklesm 1158.98 1160.07 s0001 SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1160.07 1162.09 s0001 NOW WE COME TO THIS MODE R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 1162.10 1163.83 s0001 YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THIS 
VL-solklesm 1163.84 1169.86 s0001 FIRST POSITIVE IS NOT READY AT ONE SO IT'S ACTUALLY TILTED LITTLE BIT OF THE GRAPH IS NOT REALLY THAT SENSITIVE 
VL-solklesm 1169.86 1171.60 s0001 BUT THE FOLLOWING ONE AT SEVENTY PERCENT 
VL-solklesm 1171.61 1173.48 s0001 NOW IT'S TILTED LOW MORE 
VL-solklesm 1173.49 1176.48 s0001 AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT I ACTUALLY TAKE THE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1176.48 1177.74 s0001 AND I WAIT 
VL-solklesm 1177.75 1178.83 s0001 THE SLOPE 
VL-solklesm 1178.83 1180.58 s0001 OF BE ASSOCIATED 
VL-solklesm 1180.59 1181.82 s0001 LINE SEGMENT 
VL-solklesm 1181.82 1183.45 s0001 TO THE VALUE OF THE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1183.45 1187.46 s0001 THAT WAY YOU CAN STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE CURB AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU REALISE AH HA 
VL-solklesm 1188.16 1191.22 s0001 I CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIFFERENT POINTS 
VL-solklesm 1191.22 1193.04 s0001 AND THE DATASET AND WHERE THEY SIT 
VL-solklesm 1193.04 1194.93 s0001 SO THIS TURNS OUT TO BE 
VL-solklesm 1194.93 1198.74 s0001 NOWHERE NEARLY AS POSITIVE AS THE SCORE ACTUALLY TELLS YOU SO 
VL-solklesm 1198.75 1200.80 s0001 IN THE EAST GOOD R. O. C. SPACE 
VL-solklesm 1200.81 1202.81 s0001 VERTICAL IS VERY POSITIVE 
VL-solklesm 1202.83 1205.00 s0001 HERS ONTO IS VERY NEGATIVE 
VL-solklesm 1205.00 1208.02 s0001 AND ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN IS THE VALUE OF 
VL-solklesm 1208.03 1209.35 s0001 THIS CORE HOWEVER 
VL-solklesm 1209.35 1212.19 s0001 THERE'S A PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH WHEN YOU HAVE 
VL-solklesm 1212.20 1213.54 s0001 MISS RANKS 
VL-solklesm 1213.54 1215.81 s0001 MISS RANKS NEED TO BE CORRECTED BECAUSE 
VL-solklesm 1215.82 1221.08 s0001 THE WHOLE IDEA OF PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE A GROUND TRUTH IN THE FORM OF THE LABEL 
VL-solklesm 1221.08 1223.85 s0001 AND THEN YOU HAVE THE SCORED THAT COMES ALONG WITH IT 
VL-solklesm 1224.09 1227.48 s0001 AND NEGATIVE EXAMPLE LIKE INSTANCE NUMBER THREE 
VL-solklesm 1227.64 1229.85 s0001 WE KNOW IT'S A NEGATIVE EXAMPLE 
VL-solklesm 1229.85 1232.17 s0001 BECAUSE THE LABEL IS A GROUND TRUTH 
VL-solklesm 1232.18 1236.70 s0001 NOW I'M GOING BACK INTO BE SUPERVISED LEARNING NOTION WHERE YOU HAVE A LABEL ANYONE 
VL-solklesm 1236.71 1237.99 s0001 YOU WANNA BELIEVE IT 
VL-solklesm 1237.99 1241.13 s0001 AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MEASURE HOW GOOD THAT SCORE AGAINST IT 
VL-solklesm 1241.14 1242.62 s0001 WE REALISE THAT 
VL-solklesm 1242.61 1244.26 s0001 AT SIXTY PERCENT 
VL-solklesm 1244.27 1246.15 s0001 POSITIVE CLASS MEMBERSHIP 
VL-solklesm 1246.15 1248.94 s0001 DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO A NEGATIVE LABEL 
VL-solklesm 1248.95 1250.73 s0001 THAT'S ACTUALLY AN AIR RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1250.73 1253.04 s0001 BUT WHERE IS THE AIR OF IT 
VL-solklesm 1253.05 1254.11 s0001 IS IT 
VL-solklesm 1254.11 1257.29 s0001 COMPLETE BAD DECISIONS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS HERE 
VL-solklesm 1257.30 1259.89 s0001 THIS SCORED AS A FALSE POSITIVE 
VL-solklesm 1259.99 1264.71 s0001 IT SAID THAT THE MODEL GAVE YOU A FALSE POSITIVE ON THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE 
VL-solklesm 1264.71 1268.95 s0001 IT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE BECAUSE THERE'S FORTY PERCENT OF THAT SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1268.95 1270.50 s0001 THAT IS ALSO NEGATIVE 
VL-solklesm 1270.51 1274.83 s0001 SO THE ERROR HAPPENED ON SIXTY PERCENT OF THE FULL ONE 
VL-solklesm 1274.84 1276.14 s0001 OF THE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1276.15 1277.79 s0001 NOT 
VL-solklesm 1277.79 1280.64 s0001 AS BAD AS THE R. O. C. WOULD ACTUALLY SAY 
VL-solklesm 1280.66 1282.05 s0001 AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS HERE 
VL-solklesm 1282.05 1283.31 s0001 IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 1283.32 1284.53 s0001 THE TILT 
VL-solklesm 1284.54 1285.63 s0001 OF THE 
VL-solklesm 1285.65 1287.32 s0001 OF THE LINE SEGMENT 
VL-solklesm 1287.32 1291.53 s0001 IS THE INVERSE OF THAT SCORE WHICH IS ONE MINUS TO SIXTY PERCENT 
VL-solklesm 1291.54 1292.88 s0001 BY FORTY PERCENT 
VL-solklesm 1292.90 1296.87 s0001 SO IT'S FORTY PERCENT UP AND SIXTY PERCENT DOWN THAT'S WHY IT APPEARS TO BE 
VL-solklesm 1296.86 1298.76 s0001 MORE HORIZONTAL THAN IS VERTICAL 
VL-solklesm 1298.76 1302.25 s0001 RIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO SWAP THE TWO BECAUSE YOU COMPARING TO THE GROUND TRUTH 
VL-solklesm 1302.26 1304.22 s0001 NOW THE BEAUTY OF OF THIS METHOD HERE 
VL-solklesm 1304.22 1306.95 s0001 NOW I CAN COMPARE THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER 
VL-solklesm 1306.95 1311.62 s0001 AND IT BECOMES TOTALLY SUBJECTIVE SINCE UM LOOKING AT THINGS FROM 
VL-solklesm 1311.62 1315.08 s0001 AND EVALUATION PERSPECTIVE NOW FROM A MODEL SELECTION OR 
VL-solklesm 1315.09 1316.42 s0001 MODEL DEVELOPMENT 
VL-solklesm 1316.44 1317.76 s0001 A PERSPECTIVE 
VL-solklesm 1317.76 1319.88 s0001 I CAN TAKE ANY BINARY DECISION 
VL-solklesm 1319.89 1321.03 s0001 AND ANY SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1321.04 1322.21 s0001 AND BOOM 
VL-solklesm 1322.21 1324.41 s0001 I HAVE A CURVE FOR RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1324.41 1326.84 s0001 NOW IF I HAVE MULTIPLE USERS 
VL-solklesm 1326.84 1328.10 s0001 SO LET'S SAY 
VL-solklesm 1328.11 1331.79 s0001 I HAVE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE RECOMMENDING THESE MOVIES ALL I HAVE TO DO 
VL-solklesm 1331.80 1335.01 s0001 IS THROW UP ON THE GRAPH A WHOLE BUNCH OF CURVES RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1335.01 1336.33 s0001 AND THEN 
VL-solklesm 1336.34 1341.00 s0001 DETERMINE THE SET OF INSTANCES THE SET OF MOVIES THAT THEY ALL AGREE ON 
VL-solklesm 1341.01 1342.16 s0001 BASED ON THAT 
VL-solklesm 1342.17 1346.09 s0001 PLOT AND COME BACK AND SAY I HAVE A CLEAN SET WHERE THEY IN GREAT 
VL-solklesm 1346.09 1350.23 s0001 OR MAYBE I WILL ALLOW TEN PERCENT TOLERANCE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 
VL-solklesm 1350.24 1353.17 s0001 OR WHATEVER I I WANT TO DO I CAN NOW SELECT 
VL-solklesm 1353.18 1355.36 s0001 DIFFERENT SUBSETS OF INSTANCES 
VL-solklesm 1355.68 1358.14 s0001 A GIVEN MODELS AGREE 
VL-solklesm 1358.38 1359.77 s0001 SO 
VL-solklesm 1359.78 1363.85 s0001 NOW THAT THE UNDER THE HOOD THE ACTUAL MUTTERED ITSELF 
VL-solklesm 1365.38 1369.36 s0001 TO SIMPLIFY THINGS LET'S LET'S GO BACK TO BE 
VL-solklesm 1369.37 1372.38 s0001 PROBLEM OF OVERLAPPING NORMAL DISTRIBUTION 
VL-solklesm 1372.39 1374.21 s0001 NOW THE FIRST THING I NEED TO 
VL-solklesm 1374.21 1376.46 s0001 EMPHASIZE HERE IS THAT I HAVE A SET UP 
VL-solklesm 1376.47 1378.44 s0001 POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES THAT OVERLAP 
VL-solklesm 1378.44 1381.10 s0001 IF THEY DO NOT OVERLAP IN THEIR SEPARATE BOWL 
VL-solklesm 1381.11 1384.00 s0001 AND THEN I CAN GO HOME THERE'S NO NEED TO DO ANYTHING HERE 
VL-solklesm 1384.26 1386.10 s0001 THE QUESTION IS WHAT 
VL-solklesm 1386.11 1387.49 s0001 HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE 
VL-solklesm 1387.49 1390.07 s0001 ERRORS WHEN YOU HAVE ISSUES IN BETWEEN 
VL-solklesm 1390.48 1392.96 s0001 SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO DEFINE HERE 
VL-solklesm 1392.97 1394.42 s0001 THE LETTERS L. N. 
VL-solklesm 1394.43 1397.09 s0001 H. REFER TO PARTICULAR SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1397.10 1399.09 s0001 WHETHER WITH THE SCORE IS HIGH 
VL-solklesm 1399.09 1404.17 s0001 OR LOW HOW DO WE DECIDE HIGH AND LOW IS BY THAT GREEN LINE IN THE MIDDLE SOMEWHERE 
VL-solklesm 1404.18 1408.27 s0001 RIGHT AND I SAY SOMEWHERE JUST BECAUSE IN THE PICTURE EVERYTHING IS BALANCED LICENSE 
VL-solklesm 1408.27 1412.66 s0001 AND THEY INTERSECT AT A GIVEN POINT LET'S ASSUME WE CAN FIND THAT BOUNDARY 
VL-solklesm 1412.66 1414.18 s0001 BASED ON THAT BOUNDARY 
VL-solklesm 1414.18 1415.58 s0001 EVERYTHING TO THAT 
VL-solklesm 1415.59 1417.45 s0001 TO YOUR RIGHT ABOUT BOUNDARY 
VL-solklesm 1417.47 1418.80 s0001 WILL BE HIGH SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1418.81 1422.01 s0001 EVERYTHING TO THE LEFT ABOUT BOUNDARY IS A LOW SCORE RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1422.02 1423.66 s0001 HOWEVER 
VL-solklesm 1423.66 1426.50 s0001 BECAUSE THE TWO DISTRIBUTIONS OVERLAP 
VL-solklesm 1426.51 1429.27 s0001 WE HAVE A SUBSET OF THE POSITIVES THERE ARE 
VL-solklesm 1429.27 1431.49 s0001 SITTING ON THIS SIDE OF THE BOUNDARY 
VL-solklesm 1431.50 1433.72 s0001 AND WE HAVE A SUBSET OF THE NEGATIVES THAT SAID 
VL-solklesm 1433.73 1435.04 s0001 ON THAT SIDE OF THE BOUNDARY 
VL-solklesm 1435.04 1437.56 s0001 AND THOSE IN A SENSE ARE FALSE POSITIVES 
VL-solklesm 1437.57 1439.39 s0001 AND THOSE ARE FALSE NEGATIVES 
VL-solklesm 1439.79 1441.71 s0001 THE QUESTION HERE IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 1441.72 1443.01 s0001 WE WANT TO REASON 
VL-solklesm 1443.02 1444.14 s0001 WITHIN 
VL-solklesm 1444.15 1445.52 s0001 THESE SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1445.53 1447.20 s0001 AND THESE DECISIONS 
VL-solklesm 1447.21 1451.48 s0001 THE LABEL IS THE GROUND TRUTH BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE AS I LEARNED 
VL-solklesm 1451.49 1453.04 s0001 LAST COUPLE OF DAYS 
VL-solklesm 1453.05 1456.59 s0001 SO I WILL DEFINE THE SET OF HIGH SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1457.22 1462.73 s0001 ASSIGNED TO POSITIVE LABELS AND THE SET OF LOW SCORES ASSIGNED TO NEGATIVE 
VL-solklesm 1462.74 1464.76 s0001 UM INSTANCES 
VL-solklesm 1464.77 1467.19 s0001 TO BE WHAT'S CALLED APPROPRIATE SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1467.20 1468.38 s0001 THERE'S A GOOD SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1468.39 1470.49 s0001 BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1470.49 1472.07 s0001 AND THE LABEL AGREE 
VL-solklesm 1472.07 1474.16 s0001 BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT WE WANT 
VL-solklesm 1474.18 1477.20 s0001 POSITIVES TO HAVE HIGHER SCORES THE NEGATIVES RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1477.20 1481.63 s0001 AND THAT'S THE MAGNITUDE THAT I'LL USE AS THE SCORE ASSIGNED TO THESE 
VL-solklesm 1481.64 1482.95 s0001 ANOTHER SAID 
VL-solklesm 1482.96 1486.38 s0001 WHICH IS THE COMPLEMENTARY SAID THE AN APPROPRIATE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1486.38 1487.77 s0001 IS WHEN YOU HAVE 
VL-solklesm 1487.78 1489.36 s0001 AND NEGATIVE EXAMPLE 
VL-solklesm 1489.37 1493.12 s0001 IT HAS A HIGH SCORE OR POSITIVE EXAMPLE THAT HAS A LOW SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1493.53 1497.19 s0001 AND THESE I WILL CONSIDER AS INAPPROPRIATE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1497.20 1500.08 s0001 AND WHEN I GO TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THEM 
VL-solklesm 1500.09 1502.02 s0001 I WILL TAKE THE INVERSE OF 
VL-solklesm 1502.03 1505.70 s0001 THEIR VALUE AND THIS IS THE SCORING VALUE THAT I'LL USE 
VL-solklesm 1505.70 1507.00 s0001 TO PLOT 
VL-solklesm 1507.01 1509.80 s0001 SO THIS IS THE WEIGHING RACIAL NOW 
VL-solklesm 1511.53 1513.31 s0001 IN THE CONTEXT OF 
VL-solklesm 1513.32 1515.32 s0001 OF SOME OF YOUR WORK HERE 
VL-solklesm 1515.33 1516.72 s0001 I 
VL-solklesm 1516.77 1519.60 s0001 I CAME UP WITH THIS INTERESTING NOW 
VL-solklesm 1519.61 1522.16 s0001 CLASSIFIERS THAT WOULD DETECT OUTLIERS 
VL-solklesm 1522.17 1523.50 s0001 AND IT TURNS OUT 
VL-solklesm 1523.50 1525.06 s0001 IF YOU HAVE AN OUTLIER 
VL-solklesm 1525.06 1527.66 s0001 IN THE RED OR BLUE ZONES 
VL-solklesm 1527.67 1529.06 s0001 RIGHT THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED A 
VL-solklesm 1529.06 1530.61 s0001 A TRIVIAL OUTLIER 
VL-solklesm 1530.62 1532.18 s0001 I WOULD CONSIDERED AS AN AIR 
VL-solklesm 1532.20 1533.24 s0001 FOR EXAMPLE 
VL-solklesm 1533.25 1534.68 s0001 BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE 
VL-solklesm 1534.69 1536.36 s0001 THAT'S A MORE DIFFICULT POINT 
VL-solklesm 1536.37 1537.50 s0001 SO 
VL-solklesm 1537.50 1539.78 s0001 TAKE THIS GRAPH AND TRAVERSE IT 
VL-solklesm 1539.78 1541.11 s0001 CARS AMPLY 
VL-solklesm 1541.12 1542.50 s0001 AND I THINK 
VL-solklesm 1542.50 1546.57 s0001 OF THE TOP TWO SETS AS THE SET OF TRIVIAL EXAMPLE 
VL-solklesm 1546.58 1549.71 s0001 THOSE ARE THE EASY POSITIVES IN THE EASY NEGATIVES 
VL-solklesm 1549.72 1552.21 s0001 BECAUSE THEY HAVE HIGH SCORES AND LOW SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1552.21 1553.90 s0001 IF THE MODEL 
VL-solklesm 1553.96 1556.44 s0001 MAKES ANY MISS CLASSIFICATIONS THERE 
VL-solklesm 1556.45 1559.21 s0001 I THINK IT SHOULD BE PENALISED VERY HEAVILY 
VL-solklesm 1559.30 1562.03 s0001 BECAUSE THOSE ARE OBVIOUS POINT THAT SHOULD BE 
VL-solklesm 1562.04 1563.51 s0001 IT'S IT'S NO BRAINER 
VL-solklesm 1563.52 1564.81 s0001 YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEM 
VL-solklesm 1564.81 1568.42 s0001 BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE LIES THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS 
VL-solklesm 1568.43 1573.58 s0001 PROBLEM IN THIS DOMAIN WHEN YOU HAVE THE OVERLAP THOSE ARE THE POINTS THEY'RE INTERESTING RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1573.59 1576.08 s0001 NOW WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MODEL ACTUALLY CAUSE 
VL-solklesm 1576.08 1578.57 s0001 CLASSIFIES CORRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE 
VL-solklesm 1578.58 1579.99 s0001 IT SHOULD BE GIVEN 
VL-solklesm 1580.00 1581.21 s0001 BONUS POINTS 
VL-solklesm 1581.21 1585.32 s0001 BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY DOING WELL IT'S FIXING SOME OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE DOMAIN 
VL-solklesm 1585.33 1587.79 s0001 BECAUSE THOSE ARE DIFFICULT POINTS TO DEAL WITH RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1587.79 1591.87 s0001 SO WHAT I ACTUALLY WOULD PROPOSE IN THE CONTEXT OF BEER 
VL-solklesm 1591.88 1593.67 s0001 A OF DETECTING OUTLIERS 
VL-solklesm 1593.68 1595.58 s0001 IS THAT OUTLIERS LIE IN THE MIDDLE 
VL-solklesm 1595.58 1599.77 s0001 THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEMS WILL HAPPEN YOU EITHER HAVE A WRONG LABEL OR WRONG SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1599.78 1601.23 s0001 SOMEWHERE BETWEEN RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1601.41 1603.10 s0001 THE FACT THAT SO 
VL-solklesm 1603.11 1606.00 s0001 ERRORS IN IN DOING WHEN YOU APPLY A PARTICULAR 
VL-solklesm 1606.01 1607.07 s0001 ALGORITHM TO IT 
VL-solklesm 1607.08 1609.24 s0001 WILL STEM FROM TWO PROBLEMS 
VL-solklesm 1609.24 1612.64 s0001 EITHER YOU HAVE THE RIGHT SCORE BUT YOU SOMEHOW 
VL-solklesm 1612.65 1617.22 s0001 HAD A THRESHOLD VALUE THAT SOMEHOW CAUSED A MISS CLASSIFICATION 
VL-solklesm 1617.23 1621.45 s0001 OR YOU HAVE A GOOD CLASSIFICATIONS A THRESHOLD 
VL-solklesm 1621.46 1622.77 s0001 BUT YOU HAVE A WRONG SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1622.77 1625.97 s0001 ASSIGNED ABOVE OR BELOW ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE LABEL 
VL-solklesm 1625.97 1629.10 s0001 AND THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE AIR SLY IN THERE 
VL-solklesm 1629.29 1630.69 s0001 SO 
VL-solklesm 1630.70 1631.84 s0001 MECHANICS OF IT 
VL-solklesm 1631.85 1634.84 s0001 I START WITH ONE CONTINUE STABLE BASED ON THIS MEAN 
VL-solklesm 1634.85 1637.96 s0001 POINT SO I DO WRITE THAT MIDPOINT THE VERTICAL LAW 
VL-solklesm 1638.32 1641.03 s0001 AND I LOOK AT THE SCORES ONLY FIRST 
VL-solklesm 1641.03 1642.38 s0001 AND THESE SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1642.39 1644.11 s0001 WILL DIVIDE INTO PRETTY MUCH 
VL-solklesm 1644.12 1645.18 s0001 FOUR SETS 
VL-solklesm 1645.20 1647.50 s0001 HIGH SCORES THAT ARE ASSIGNED 
VL-solklesm 1647.50 1649.03 s0001 A POSITIVE 
VL-solklesm 1649.04 1651.31 s0001 POSITIVE LABELS OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND 
VL-solklesm 1651.32 1654.03 s0001 POSITIVE INSTANCES THAT ARE ASSIGNED HIGH SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1654.04 1656.23 s0001 AND NEGATIVE INSTANCES THAT ARE ASSIGNED 
VL-solklesm 1656.23 1657.31 s0001 LOW SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1657.32 1659.15 s0001 THOSE ARE GOOD SCORES THOSE ARE 
VL-solklesm 1659.16 1660.47 s0001 APPROPRIATE SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1660.47 1663.07 s0001 WHEREAS POSITIVE SIR ASSIGNED 
VL-solklesm 1663.08 1664.24 s0001 LOW SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1664.25 1667.79 s0001 OR NEGATIVES THAT ARE ASSIGNED HIGH SCORES THOSE ARE 
VL-solklesm 1667.80 1668.89 s0001 INAPPROPRIATE 
VL-solklesm 1668.90 1671.78 s0001 AND FOR EACH OF THE TWO D. YES OR NO NO 
VL-solklesm 1671.79 1674.28 s0001 I WILL BUILD A CONTINGENCY TABLE SEPARATELY 
VL-solklesm 1674.29 1675.88 s0001 I WILL DEAL WOULD BE TOO 
VL-solklesm 1675.89 1677.39 s0001 SETS DIFFERENTLY 
VL-solklesm 1677.39 1679.45 s0001 AND IT'S JUST THE INVERSE OF THE OTHER RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1679.45 1682.14 s0001 I LOOK IN THE CORRECTNESS OF THEM WHEN YOU HAVE 
VL-solklesm 1682.14 1683.30 s0001 HI POSITIVE 
VL-solklesm 1683.31 1684.41 s0001 LOW NEGATIVE 
VL-solklesm 1684.43 1687.99 s0001 THEY'RE CORRECT WHEN YOU HAVE YES OR NO PREDICTED YES OR NO 
VL-solklesm 1688.00 1689.60 s0001 AND THE VERY END OF COURSE 
VL-solklesm 1689.61 1692.30 s0001 A OF THE TESTING CYCLE 
VL-solklesm 1692.30 1693.86 s0001 OR IF IT'S OUT 
VL-solklesm 1693.87 1696.38 s0001 HI POSITIVE AND PREDICTED AS A NO 
VL-solklesm 1696.38 1698.20 s0001 LOW POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE 
VL-solklesm 1698.21 1699.94 s0001 AND PREDICTED AS A YES 
VL-solklesm 1699.94 1701.08 s0001 I GET THIS RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1701.09 1703.17 s0001 AND OF COURSE YOU DO THE INVERSE OF THAT 
VL-solklesm 1703.52 1708.01 s0001 SO LOOKING COME THAT ACCURACY CAN ACTUALLY VISUALIZE RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1708.02 1709.13 s0001 SO 
VL-solklesm 1709.14 1717.63 s0001 LET'S FORGET ABOUT THE NORMALIZATION RIGHT IN THE R. O. C. SPACE YOU NORMALISE BY THE NUMBER POSITIVES ON THE VERTICAL AXES AND THE NUMBER NEGATIVES ON ME 
VL-solklesm 1717.64 1718.99 s0001 HORIZONTAL AXES 
VL-solklesm 1719.00 1720.80 s0001 UM LET'S IGNORE D. 
VL-solklesm 1720.80 1722.33 s0001 NORMALIZATION BECAUSE IT'S A BIT 
VL-solklesm 1722.34 1724.51 s0001 CONVOLUTED HERE BUT I'LL COME BACK TO IT 
VL-solklesm 1724.51 1726.48 s0001 LET'S LOOK AT THE SCORE ITSELF 
VL-solklesm 1726.49 1730.68 s0001 SO IF I HAVE A POSITIVE INSTANCE AND IT HAS AN APPROPRIATE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1730.69 1733.08 s0001 THAT MEANS S. I. IS BIGGER THAN 
VL-solklesm 1733.09 1734.40 s0001 ONE MINUS S. I. 
VL-solklesm 1734.41 1737.40 s0001 THAT'S WHY THE VERTICAL RISE IS BIGGER 
VL-solklesm 1737.40 1738.77 s0001 THEN IT IS 
VL-solklesm 1738.77 1741.12 s0001 RUNNING ON THE HORIZONTAL AXIS RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1741.12 1744.11 s0001 THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH THE NEGATIVE INSTANCE 
VL-solklesm 1744.12 1746.10 s0001 THAT HAS AN APPROPRIATE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1746.11 1748.12 s0001 IT HAS A SMALLER SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1748.13 1750.15 s0001 THEN ONE MINUS THAT SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1750.16 1751.26 s0001 RIGHT SO VISUALLY 
VL-solklesm 1751.27 1752.32 s0001 I CAN NO 
VL-solklesm 1752.33 1753.47 s0001 PLOT THESE TWO 
VL-solklesm 1753.48 1754.72 s0001 THE INVERSE OF THAT 
VL-solklesm 1754.73 1756.92 s0001 HAPPENS TO THE INAPPROPRIATE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1757.34 1760.66 s0001 I HAVE A POSITIVE INSTANCE THAT I KNOW HAS AN A 
VL-solklesm 1760.68 1762.11 s0001 INAPPROPRIATE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 1762.12 1764.04 s0001 SO I USE THE ONE MINUS 
VL-solklesm 1764.05 1765.15 s0001 S. I. 
VL-solklesm 1765.15 1766.56 s0001 AS A VERTICAL CLIMB 
VL-solklesm 1766.56 1771.16 s0001 AND RUN BY S. I. M. F. AND THE INVERSE OF THAT FURTHER NEGATIVE INSTANCE 
VL-solklesm 1771.17 1774.53 s0001 IS THIS CLEAR THIS IS BASICALLY BE THE HARDEST BIT OF IT 
VL-solklesm 1775.28 1778.11 s0001 UP UNTIL YOU SEE THE EQUATION THAT 
VL-solklesm 1778.12 1783.41 s0001 RIGHT SO THE REASON I HAVE ALL OF THIS NOT IN THERE IS JUST A TWO 
VL-solklesm 1783.43 1786.30 s0001 SUMMARISE EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF A FORMULA 
VL-solklesm 1786.30 1787.62 s0001 THESE 
VL-solklesm 1787.63 1790.78 s0001 BUILDING A SYSTEM LIKE THIS TAKES NO MORE THAN TEN MINUTES 
VL-solklesm 1790.79 1794.06 s0001 I JUST READ IT YESTERDAY BECAUSE I HAVE PLATFORM ISSUES I'D 
VL-solklesm 1794.06 1796.82 s0001 REWROTE IT COMPLETELY IT'S BASICALLY THESE 
VL-solklesm 1796.83 1799.23 s0001 FOUR OR FIVE FORMULAS ANY 
VL-solklesm 1799.30 1800.75 s0001 DETERMINING THE MID 
VL-solklesm 1800.76 1806.02 s0001 POINT THAT'S THE VERTICAL LINE I'LL COME BACK TO THIS LITTLE LATER BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S ACTUALLY A BIG ISSUE 
VL-solklesm 1806.03 1810.92 s0001 BE VERTICAL CLIMB WHICH IS THE TRUE POSITIVE RATE OR DISMISS TRUE POSITIVE RATE 
VL-solklesm 1810.92 1813.87 s0001 BASICALLY YOU TAKE THE APPROPRIATE SCORE ASSIGNMENT 
VL-solklesm 1813.88 1817.01 s0001 DIVIDED BY SOME SORT OF A NORMALIZING FACTOR 
VL-solklesm 1817.02 1819.91 s0001 AND THE SAME THING FOR THE FALSE POSITIVE RATE 
VL-solklesm 1819.91 1822.93 s0001 IT'S THE INVERSE OF THAT WHICH IS 
VL-solklesm 1822.94 1824.68 s0001 COATED IN THE FUNCTION ITSELF 
VL-solklesm 1824.68 1827.18 s0001 BY A HORIZONTAL NORMALIZATION 
VL-solklesm 1827.19 1830.49 s0001 NOW THE NORMALIZATION FACTOR I KNOW IT LOOKS BIG AND UGLY YEAR 
VL-solklesm 1830.50 1832.04 s0001 BUT THINK ABOUT IT 
VL-solklesm 1832.04 1834.02 s0001 FOR APPROPRIATE SCORES 
VL-solklesm 1834.03 1835.47 s0001 GOING UP 
VL-solklesm 1835.48 1837.68 s0001 THE CONTRIBUTION HAPPENS FROM 
VL-solklesm 1837.69 1838.80 s0001 P. S. I. 
VL-solklesm 1838.81 1840.02 s0001 FOR POSITIVES 
VL-solklesm 1840.03 1841.64 s0001 AND THE ONE MINUS S. I. 
VL-solklesm 1841.65 1843.04 s0001 FOR THE NEGATIVES 
VL-solklesm 1843.33 1845.81 s0001 RIGHT BACK IN THE PREVIOUS LIFE 
VL-solklesm 1845.82 1847.31 s0001 SO 
VL-solklesm 1847.32 1849.34 s0001 FOR THE APPROPRIATE ONES 
VL-solklesm 1849.34 1851.86 s0001 THIS IS THE VERTICAL CUT CONTRIBUTION 
VL-solklesm 1851.87 1854.64 s0001 THE HORIZONTAL CONTRIBUTION IS THIS RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1854.64 1856.11 s0001 SO NOW YOU SEE 
VL-solklesm 1856.12 1858.96 s0001 REGARDLESS WHETHER IT'S POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE 
VL-solklesm 1858.98 1860.21 s0001 THEY ALL MADE 
VL-solklesm 1860.22 1861.72 s0001 VERTICAL CONTRIBUTION 
VL-solklesm 1861.73 1863.65 s0001 SOME BIGGER THAN OTHERS 
VL-solklesm 1863.65 1866.75 s0001 AND THEY ALL MAKE CARS ON TOLD IS A CONTRIBUTION 
VL-solklesm 1866.75 1868.94 s0001 SO THE CURVE ALWAYS GOES UP 
VL-solklesm 1868.94 1870.12 s0001 AND GOES OVER 
VL-solklesm 1870.13 1872.69 s0001 AND THIS WHAT ALLOWS ME TO DETERMINE THAT SLOPE 
VL-solklesm 1872.70 1874.81 s0001 BASED ON HOW POSITIVE IT IS 
VL-solklesm 1874.89 1878.07 s0001 RIGHT THIS IS A MAJOR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SMOOTH R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 1878.08 1880.82 s0001 AND THE REGULAR R. O. C. BECAUSE FOOD REGULAR R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 1880.83 1882.46 s0001 ONLY POSITIVES GO UP 
VL-solklesm 1882.47 1884.68 s0001 AND ONLY NEGATIVES FROM DOWN 
VL-solklesm 1886.40 1888.54 s0001 SO IF YOU LOOK AT IT 
VL-solklesm 1888.55 1890.51 s0001 THERE'S THE SET OF A 
VL-solklesm 1890.52 1895.35 s0001 POSITIVES THAT HAVE HIGH SCORES THE SET OF NEGATIVES THAT HAVE THOSE COURSE THE SET OF 
VL-solklesm 1895.35 1899.39 s0001 POSITIVE THAT HAVE LOW SCORES THE SET OF NEGATIVES THAT HAVE HIGH SCORES RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1899.39 1903.28 s0001 AND BASICALLY IT'S AS HIGH FOR THESE ONE MINUS S. I. FOR THOSE 
VL-solklesm 1903.36 1906.42 s0001 BIG IMMERSIVE THAT HAPPENS ON THE HORIZONTAL 
VL-solklesm 1906.43 1908.31 s0001 SO YOU JUST TALLY THOSE 
VL-solklesm 1908.31 1909.50 s0001 AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU 
VL-solklesm 1909.50 1912.09 s0001 BE NORMALIZATION FACTOR REQUIRED 
VL-solklesm 1912.10 1914.51 s0001 WHY IS IT REQUIRED IS TO KEEP 
VL-solklesm 1914.51 1916.24 s0001 THE TWO DIMENSIONAL PICTURE 
VL-solklesm 1916.24 1917.81 s0001 ANY UNIT SQUARE 
VL-solklesm 1917.95 1920.93 s0001 RIGHT BECAUSE YOU WANTED FROM ZERO TO ONE ZERO TO ONE 
VL-solklesm 1920.93 1923.67 s0001 YOU COULD GET RID OF THAT AND I DO BELIEVE 
VL-solklesm 1923.67 1927.75 s0001 THE REASON EQUIVALENT GRAPH FOR IT DONE BY PETER FLOCK AN EIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1927.76 1930.08 s0001 CALLED IT'S CALLED THE N. P. 
VL-solklesm 1931.12 1934.34 s0001 INSTEAD OF NORMALIZING BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE 
VL-solklesm 1934.34 1936.23 s0001 YOU SIMPLY VISUALIZE 
VL-solklesm 1936.24 1945.21 s0001 BE TRUE POSITIVE RATE AND THE FALSE POSITIVE RATE OVER THE NUMBER OF POSITIVES AND THE NEGATIVES THREE JUST FOR EACH ONE YOU GO ONE STEP UP AND YOU DON'T NORMALISE RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1945.21 1947.87 s0001 BUT THEN IT BECOMES A RECTANGLE NOT 
VL-solklesm 1947.87 1957.04 s0001 A SQUARE IT'S ONLY SQUARE IF AND ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING HERE AND SIMPLIFY ALL OF THIS AND GET RID OF IT IF YOU WANT RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 1957.04 1959.51 s0001 NOW WE COME TO THE AREA UNDER THE 
VL-solklesm 1959.51 1961.47 s0001 SMOOTH A ROW SEEKER 
VL-solklesm 1962.31 1963.96 s0001 IF I 
VL-solklesm 1963.96 1965.49 s0001 JUST QUICKLY 
VL-solklesm 1965.50 1966.87 s0001 RESTATE 
VL-solklesm 1966.88 1968.68 s0001 THE DEFINITION OF THE E. U. C. 
VL-solklesm 1968.69 1971.72 s0001 THE AREA UNDER THE STANDARD R. O. C. CURVE 
VL-solklesm 1971.73 1977.51 s0001 SHOWS YOU THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE TWO CLASSES AND IT'S DEFINED AS THE PROBABILITY OF 
VL-solklesm 1977.83 1979.33 s0001 A BRAND THEM 
VL-solklesm 1979.34 1980.63 s0001 POSITIVE POINT 
VL-solklesm 1980.64 1982.31 s0001 AND SEE HOW MANY MENTORS 
VL-solklesm 1982.32 1983.71 s0001 ARE BELOW IT 
VL-solklesm 1983.92 1986.35 s0001 SO IT SHOWS YOU THE PROBABILITY 
VL-solklesm 1986.36 1987.90 s0001 OF RANDOMLY 
VL-solklesm 1987.90 1988.99 s0001 SELECTED 
VL-solklesm 1989.00 1990.12 s0001 POSITIVE EXAMPLE 
VL-solklesm 1990.13 1991.65 s0001 BEEN RANKED HIGHER 
VL-solklesm 1991.65 1993.99 s0001 THEN A RANDOMLY SELECTED NEGATIVES 
VL-solklesm 1993.99 1995.52 s0001 SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
VL-solklesm 1995.53 2001.23 s0001 IN ENGLISH AND NATURAL LANGUAGE WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN YOU HAVE TWENTY CALCULATE THE AREA UNDER THE R. O. SEEKER 
VL-solklesm 2001.24 2003.03 s0001 BASICALLY SHOWS YOU 
VL-solklesm 2003.03 2006.19 s0001 HOW THE POSITIVES ARE SEPARATED FROM THE NEGATIVES 
VL-solklesm 2006.20 2010.35 s0001 RIGHT IT GIVES YOU A PROBABILITY OF THIS PARTICULAR MODEL IN THE ALONG THIS CURVE 
VL-solklesm 2010.35 2011.63 s0001 TO SEPARATE 
VL-solklesm 2011.64 2013.28 s0001 POSITIVES FROM THE NEGATIVES 
VL-solklesm 2013.29 2015.01 s0001 WHY BECAUSE A LONG BE 
VL-solklesm 2015.01 2016.26 s0001 Y. AXES 
VL-solklesm 2016.27 2019.26 s0001 YOU HAVE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ONLY THE POSITIVES 
VL-solklesm 2019.26 2020.54 s0001 ALONG THE B. 
VL-solklesm 2020.55 2023.61 s0001 X. AXES YOU HAVE CONTRIBUTIONS ONLY FROM THE NEGATIVES 
VL-solklesm 2023.62 2026.91 s0001 SO THE AREA IN BETWEEN IS THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE TWO 
VL-solklesm 2027.60 2030.08 s0001 HERE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT PROBLEM 
VL-solklesm 2030.09 2033.54 s0001 WE ACTUALLY HAVE CONTRIBUTION FROM POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES HERE 
VL-solklesm 2033.54 2035.28 s0001 AND POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES HERE 
VL-solklesm 2035.29 2036.96 s0001 SO THEN YOU ASK WAIT A MINUTE 
VL-solklesm 2036.96 2038.79 s0001 THEN HOW DO YOU INTERPRET 
VL-solklesm 2038.80 2040.33 s0001 THIS AREA UNDER THE CURVE 
VL-solklesm 2040.33 2041.98 s0001 WELL IF YOU REMEMBER 
VL-solklesm 2042.46 2050.41 s0001 THE VERTICAL RISE OF EVERY INSTANCE WAS HOW POSITIVE THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE WAS ACCORDING TO ITS LABEL 
VL-solklesm 2051.10 2053.41 s0001 THIS WAS AN APPROPRIATE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 2053.42 2056.02 s0001 WHEREAS THIS WAS INAPPROPRIATE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 2056.03 2058.60 s0001 SO BASICALLY THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE TWO 
VL-solklesm 2058.60 2061.62 s0001 SHOWS YOU HOW WELL THE MODEL SEPARATES 
VL-solklesm 2061.63 2063.05 s0001 GOOD GOOD SCORES 
VL-solklesm 2063.06 2064.23 s0001 FROM THE BAT SCORES 
VL-solklesm 2064.23 2066.73 s0001 WHETHER BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE CARES 
VL-solklesm 2067.46 2068.87 s0001 IN ESSENCE 
VL-solklesm 2068.89 2070.77 s0001 I ACTUALLY CAN COMPARE NOW 
VL-solklesm 2070.78 2073.32 s0001 ANY POINT TO ANY POINT IN THE DATASET 
VL-solklesm 2073.33 2074.89 s0001 BASED ON ITS CORE 
VL-solklesm 2074.90 2079.09 s0001 AND THAT IS A MAJOR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO WHICH LEADS ME TO 
VL-solklesm 2079.26 2081.82 s0001 INTERPRET THIS NATURALLY IN AND 
VL-solklesm 2081.82 2083.23 s0001 REVERSE ORDER 
VL-solklesm 2083.23 2085.52 s0001 IS THAT IMAGINE YOU HAVE A MODEL 
VL-solklesm 2085.75 2088.04 s0001 AND YOU BUILD THIS CURVE 
VL-solklesm 2088.04 2092.02 s0001 AND YOU GET THE AREA UNDER DISTANT UNDER THE SMOOTH ARE A SEEKER 
VL-solklesm 2092.03 2093.08 s0001 AND YOU GO BACK 
VL-solklesm 2093.09 2094.50 s0001 AND HE SAY WHAT DOES IT MEAN 
VL-solklesm 2094.51 2095.68 s0001 ACTUALLY MEANS 
VL-solklesm 2095.69 2097.39 s0001 HOW YOU TAKE A MODEL 
VL-solklesm 2097.40 2100.15 s0001 AND YOU HOPE YOU ASSUME THAT THE MODEL IS OKAY 
VL-solklesm 2100.16 2102.08 s0001 AND YOU GO BACK AND SAMPLE YOUR DATA 
VL-solklesm 2102.09 2103.13 s0001 ACCORDING TO THE MODEL 
VL-solklesm 2103.14 2106.62 s0001 YOU'RE BIASING THE MODEL BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING THIS COURSE AND YOU'RE SAYING 
VL-solklesm 2106.64 2108.10 s0001 I'LL FIX EAST COURSE 
VL-solklesm 2108.12 2109.35 s0001 I'LL TAKE THESE LABELS 
VL-solklesm 2109.36 2111.08 s0001 AND SEE HOW WELL THEY AGREED 
VL-solklesm 2111.09 2112.97 s0001 SO YOU'RE SAMPLING THE DATA 
VL-solklesm 2112.98 2115.50 s0001 BASED ON HOW GOOD THE MODEL IS 
VL-solklesm 2115.57 2117.16 s0001 WHICH ALSO 
VL-solklesm 2117.16 2119.12 s0001 BRINGS AN INTERESTING 
VL-solklesm 2119.14 2120.52 s0001 WEAKNESS OF THIS 
VL-solklesm 2120.54 2121.67 s0001 A APPROACH 
VL-solklesm 2121.67 2125.62 s0001 YOU COULD CALL IT THE WEAKNESS I DON'T THINK IT'S A WEAKNESS I THINK IT'S JUST IRRELEVANT 
VL-solklesm 2125.62 2127.42 s0001 IS THE FACT THAT IF YOU HAVE A PERFECT 
VL-solklesm 2127.44 2128.54 s0001 CLASS A FIRE 
VL-solklesm 2128.55 2130.35 s0001 THIS MODEL WILL COLLAPSE 
VL-solklesm 2130.52 2132.86 s0001 BECAUSE I WILL HAVE NO 
VL-solklesm 2132.87 2134.67 s0001 INTERSECTION IN BETWEEN 
VL-solklesm 2134.69 2136.22 s0001 IF I HAVE A PERFECT 
VL-solklesm 2136.23 2138.24 s0001 CLEAN DIVISION BETWEEN THE TWO 
VL-solklesm 2138.25 2139.76 s0001 I HAVE NOTHING TO SEPARATE 
VL-solklesm 2139.76 2144.56 s0001 THE WHOLE VISUALS GRAPH THAT I'M ACTUALLY PLOTTING IS THE SEPARATION BETWEEN 
VL-solklesm 2144.57 2146.70 s0001 THE APPROPRIATE ONES THE ONES ON THE TOP 
VL-solklesm 2146.71 2148.71 s0001 AND THIS OVERLAP IN THE MIDDLE 
VL-solklesm 2148.88 2150.27 s0001 AND THAT'S WHY 
VL-solklesm 2150.28 2154.74 s0001 IMAGINE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DO UM OUTLIER DETECTION 
VL-solklesm 2155.78 2158.40 s0001 IN A DOMAIN WHERE THERE ARE NO OUTLIERS 
VL-solklesm 2158.41 2160.29 s0001 YOU BASICALLY GET RESULTS 
VL-solklesm 2160.80 2165.23 s0001 ON THE OTHER HAND YOU COULD ALSO INVERSE THE SAME SITUATION BY HAVING 
VL-solklesm 2165.23 2167.85 s0001 A SYSTEM THAT ONLY GIVES YOU OUTLIERS 
VL-solklesm 2167.87 2169.00 s0001 ABSOLUTELY NO 
VL-solklesm 2169.02 2170.06 s0001 GOOD POINTS 
VL-solklesm 2170.07 2172.86 s0001 AND THE SAME THING THAT IF I HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS TOTALLY RANDOM 
VL-solklesm 2172.87 2174.06 s0001 THAT IS NO GOOD 
VL-solklesm 2174.07 2175.56 s0001 THEN THIS WILL COLLAPSE AGAIN 
VL-solklesm 2175.57 2178.80 s0001 SO EITHER BOUNDARY IS A PROBLEM I NEED SOMETHING GOOD 
VL-solklesm 2178.81 2182.19 s0001 TO TO WORK WITH AND SOMETHING BAD TO ASSESS 
VL-solklesm 2182.98 2185.11 s0001 SO THE EXPERIMENT 
VL-solklesm 2185.19 2187.06 s0001 FOR THE EXPERIMENTS 
VL-solklesm 2188.80 2190.83 s0001 I WANTED TO SHOW 
VL-solklesm 2190.84 2192.17 s0001 THAT 
VL-solklesm 2192.17 2194.03 s0001 THIS METHOD WILL DETECT 
VL-solklesm 2194.04 2197.25 s0001 SIMILARITIES WHEN SIMILARITIES ARE PRESENT 
VL-solklesm 2197.27 2199.52 s0001 AND WILL ALSO MEASURED DIFFERENCES 
VL-solklesm 2199.53 2201.82 s0001 WHEN DIFFERENCES ARE PRESENT 
VL-solklesm 2202.62 2208.02 s0001 AND I WANTED TO COMPARE IT TO THE STANDARD R. O. C. TO SHOW THAT I ACTUALLY HAVE AGAIN 
VL-solklesm 2208.03 2209.86 s0001 OVER THE R. O. C. THERE IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 2209.87 2212.62 s0001 EXTRA INFORMATION THAT I CAPTURE FROM THIS COURSE 
VL-solklesm 2212.62 2215.21 s0001 SO THE FIRST TASK WAS HOW DO I 
VL-solklesm 2215.21 2216.96 s0001 PRODUCED SIMILARITIES 
VL-solklesm 2216.98 2218.39 s0001 AND HOW DO I MAKE 
VL-solklesm 2218.44 2220.12 s0001 CUP THESE DIFFERENCES 
VL-solklesm 2220.14 2223.58 s0001 SO ONE APPROACH WOULD BE TO USE SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATORS RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 2223.59 2225.09 s0001 THIS EXPERIMENT I DIDN'T 
VL-solklesm 2225.10 2228.15 s0001 I DON'T HAVE IT HERE BUT IT'S A LITTLE PIECES I DID THAT 
VL-solklesm 2228.16 2229.56 s0001 FOR SOMETHING ELSE 
VL-solklesm 2230.19 2233.94 s0001 I WANTED TO KEEP THIS NATURAL SO I WENT AND I GOT A WHOLE BUNCH DATASET 
VL-solklesm 2233.96 2235.94 s0001 AND THEN I CAME BACK AND I THOUGHT WAIT A MINUTE 
VL-solklesm 2235.94 2237.31 s0001 SIMILARITIES 
VL-solklesm 2237.32 2239.59 s0001 YOU CAN ACTUALLY PRODUCE SIMILARITIES 
VL-solklesm 2239.59 2241.99 s0001 IF YOU APPLY THIS SAME MODEL 
VL-solklesm 2242.00 2243.32 s0001 AND DIFFERENT SUBSETS 
VL-solklesm 2243.33 2244.71 s0001 OF THE DOMAIN 
VL-solklesm 2245.19 2248.16 s0001 ASSUMING THAT THE DATA COMES FROM THE SAME DOMAIN 
VL-solklesm 2248.17 2249.96 s0001 YOU GET SOME SAMPLES 
VL-solklesm 2249.96 2252.89 s0001 OF IT APPLY THE SAME MODEL TO IT 
VL-solklesm 2253.39 2257.29 s0001 IN SOME RANDOM VARIATIONS YOU SHOULD GET THE SAME ANSWER 
VL-solklesm 2257.81 2261.44 s0001 IT SHOULD BE SIMILAR SO IF I BUILD A DECISION TREE ON A MODEL 
VL-solklesm 2261.61 2265.60 s0001 ON A ON A DATA SET A SUBSET FROM A GIVEN DOMAIN 
VL-solklesm 2265.61 2268.16 s0001 I BUILD A DECISION TREE AND THEN I BUILD A SECOND ONE 
VL-solklesm 2268.17 2271.13 s0001 FROM A DIFFERENT SUBSET FROM THE SAME DOMAIN 
VL-solklesm 2271.14 2273.85 s0001 GIVEN THAT THE DOMAIN HASN'T CHANGED 
VL-solklesm 2273.85 2277.31 s0001 THESE TWO SHOULD KEEP ME PRETTY MUCH THE SAME PERFORMANCE 
VL-solklesm 2277.31 2279.50 s0001 RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT SIMILARITY IS 
VL-solklesm 2279.51 2282.14 s0001 SO IF I TAKE A REALLY HUGE DATASET 
VL-solklesm 2282.14 2284.71 s0001 STOP SAMPLE FORTY PERCENT OF IT 
VL-solklesm 2284.71 2286.56 s0001 TRAIN AND TEST 
VL-solklesm 2286.57 2290.02 s0001 AND DO IT AGAIN AND DO IT AGAIN AND DO IT AGAIN AND DO IT AGAIN 
VL-solklesm 2290.03 2292.18 s0001 THE ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT THESE MODELS 
VL-solklesm 2292.19 2294.12 s0001 EVENTUALLY WILL LOOK SIMILAR 
VL-solklesm 2294.13 2295.76 s0001 RIGHT THEY HAVE TO LOOK SIMILAR 
VL-solklesm 2295.77 2298.44 s0001 OTHERWISE NOTHING WILL WILL BE GOOD 
VL-solklesm 2299.01 2301.03 s0001 THE SAME THING IF I TOOK 
VL-solklesm 2301.04 2304.84 s0001 FUNDAMENTALLY TWO DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE DIFFERENT 
VL-solklesm 2304.85 2307.06 s0001 APPLY THEM TO THE SAME DATASET 
VL-solklesm 2307.08 2309.81 s0001 I SHOULD SEE THESE DIFFERENCES 
VL-solklesm 2309.91 2313.81 s0001 NOW GIVEN THAT I HAVE THESE DIFFERENCES ALL SEE HOW THEY PAN OUT 
VL-solklesm 2314.94 2316.55 s0001 PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT 
VL-solklesm 2316.56 2320.17 s0001 SO I TOOK TWENTY DATED TWENTY SIX YOU SEE I DATASET 
VL-solklesm 2320.17 2322.54 s0001 FROM THE MACHINE LEARNING REPOSITORY 
VL-solklesm 2322.54 2325.36 s0001 AND I USED TO MODELS 
VL-solklesm 2325.36 2331.41 s0001 I USED A PROBABILITY ESTIMATE INCREASE AND I USE NINE BASE THE REASON I USE THESE TWO IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 2331.42 2333.23 s0001 THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER 
VL-solklesm 2333.23 2335.04 s0001 THEY'RE BOTH CLASS FIRES 
VL-solklesm 2335.04 2339.10 s0001 THEY BOTH PRODUCE WHAT SO CALLED PROBABILITIES ONE 
VL-solklesm 2339.11 2342.87 s0001 IS KNOWN TO PRODUCE POOR PROBABILITIES THAT ARE NOT CALIBRATED 
VL-solklesm 2342.87 2346.92 s0001 THE OTHER ONE IS KNOWN TO PRODUCE VERY CALIBRATED PROBABILITIES RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 2347.48 2354.65 s0001 AND I USE THEM TO DETERMINE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES NOW WHEN IT COMES TO SIMILARITIES I'M NOT USING BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER 
VL-solklesm 2354.65 2355.95 s0001 I LEAVE ONE ASIDE 
VL-solklesm 2355.96 2357.69 s0001 I USE THE SAME MODEL 
VL-solklesm 2358.04 2361.13 s0001 OR A WHOLE BUNCH OF RUNS ON EACH OF THE DATA SETS 
VL-solklesm 2361.14 2363.29 s0001 AND THEN I SEE HOW CLOSE 
VL-solklesm 2363.83 2365.27 s0001 CURVES ARE IF 
VL-solklesm 2365.28 2367.24 s0001 WHEN I COMPARE THE TWO TO EACH OTHER 
VL-solklesm 2367.25 2368.92 s0001 EXACTLY THE SAME RUN BUT IT 
VL-solklesm 2368.92 2371.44 s0001 THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT MODELS AND I SHOULD HAVE DIFFERENCES 
VL-solklesm 2371.46 2376.29 s0001 I DID THIS IN USING TEN FOLD CROSS VALIDATION REPEATED TEN TIMES JUST 
VL-solklesm 2376.30 2378.80 s0001 TO MAKE SURE I GET ALL OF THE AVERAGES 
VL-solklesm 2379.21 2381.19 s0001 AND THEN I YEAH 
VL-solklesm 2382.62 2385.81 s0001 I BASICALLY TOOK THE APPROACH IS THAT THE SAME LEARNING 
VL-solklesm 2385.82 2387.98 s0001 MODEL APPLIED TO THE SAME 
VL-solklesm 2387.98 2389.89 s0001 DATA DRAWN FROM THE DOMAIN 
VL-solklesm 2389.90 2394.27 s0001 SHOULD PRODUCE SIMILARITIES WHEREAS DIFFERENT MODELS APPLIED TO THE SAME DATASET 
VL-solklesm 2394.28 2395.41 s0001 SHOULD PRODUCE 
VL-solklesm 2395.42 2396.57 s0001 DIFFERENCES RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 2396.57 2397.95 s0001 AND I RECORDED 
VL-solklesm 2397.96 2399.41 s0001 THE AREA UNDER 
VL-solklesm 2399.42 2400.64 s0001 BOTH OF THE CURVES 
VL-solklesm 2400.65 2408.37 s0001 THE PROBLEM IS THAT HERE YOU CAN IMAGINE REPEATED EXPERIMENTS EACH OF THEM IS A CURVE INTO TWO DIMENSIONAL SPACE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SIT DOWN AND TRY TO 
VL-solklesm 2408.38 2411.38 s0001 COMPARE EACH ONE OF THEM THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE THESIS THE SPACE 
VL-solklesm 2411.39 2412.48 s0001 I WOULD SAY 
VL-solklesm 2412.48 2417.16 s0001 SO ONE WAY SUMMARIZING THE WHOLE CURVE IS TO TAKE THE AREA UNDER IT 
VL-solklesm 2417.17 2420.94 s0001 SO I TOOK THE AREA UNDER THE R. O. C. CURVE AND I TOOK THE AREA UNDER 
VL-solklesm 2420.94 2423.26 s0001 THE SMOOTH R. O. C. CURVE AND I COMPARED THEM 
VL-solklesm 2423.27 2426.79 s0001 AND THE THESIS I HAD ACTUALLY HAVE EXAMPLES WHERE THE CURVES ARE AVAILABLE 
VL-solklesm 2427.06 2428.86 s0001 SO HERE'S WHAT I HAVE 
VL-solklesm 2428.86 2430.15 s0001 SIMILARITIES 
VL-solklesm 2430.16 2431.19 s0001 SO TAKING 
VL-solklesm 2431.21 2433.03 s0001 PROBABILITY ESTIMATING TREAT 
VL-solklesm 2433.04 2435.73 s0001 AND I APPLY IT TO ALL OF THESE DATA SETS 
VL-solklesm 2435.73 2436.89 s0001 AND I RECORD 
VL-solklesm 2436.89 2439.85 s0001 THE STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE 
VL-solklesm 2439.86 2443.84 s0001 AND THE STANDARD DEVIATION AND THE AVERAGE OF THAT AREA UNDER THE CURVE 
VL-solklesm 2443.85 2446.98 s0001 THE BLUE COLLAR IS THE STANDARD R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 2446.98 2449.08 s0001 AND THE RED COLOUR IS 
VL-solklesm 2449.10 2451.27 s0001 THIS MOVE R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 2451.73 2453.82 s0001 THE ONE THAT WE CAME UP WITH 
VL-solklesm 2453.86 2456.81 s0001 THE FIRST OBSERVATION I HAVE IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 2456.82 2462.56 s0001 AS THE STANDARD DEVIATION INCREASES ACROSS THE DATASET FOR ONE GIVEN MODEL 
VL-solklesm 2462.96 2465.80 s0001 BE SMOOTH OUR O. C. GIVES 
VL-solklesm 2465.81 2468.54 s0001 LESS DEVIATION THAN THE STANDARD 
VL-solklesm 2468.56 2471.88 s0001 THIS DOES MAKE SENSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE 
VL-solklesm 2471.92 2473.69 s0001 A GIVEN POINT 
VL-solklesm 2473.69 2476.12 s0001 IS DETERMINED TO BE ABOVE OR BELOW THIS 
VL-solklesm 2476.12 2478.56 s0001 THRESHOLD IN THE STANDARD R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 2478.57 2481.22 s0001 IRRELEVANT OF ITS DISTANCE 
VL-solklesm 2481.23 2487.84 s0001 SO IF YOU REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT AND THIS POINT SHOWS UP SOMETIMES HERE SOMETIMES THERE SOMETIMES HERE 
VL-solklesm 2487.84 2488.90 s0001 THE R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 2488.91 2491.31 s0001 IS CRUDE IS TOO RIGID 
VL-solklesm 2491.32 2494.19 s0001 SO IN GENERATES HIGHER STANDARD DEVIATION 
VL-solklesm 2494.19 2495.35 s0001 IN THE AREA 
VL-solklesm 2495.37 2499.77 s0001 THEN THIS MOVE BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS IS MORE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER CHANCES ARE 
VL-solklesm 2499.77 2504.29 s0001 THAT LINE ASSOCIATED WITH A GIVEN POINT DID NOT REALLY MOVE TOO MUCH 
VL-solklesm 2504.34 2506.89 s0001 IT'S CLOSE EACH OTHER AND WE SEE THAT 
VL-solklesm 2506.90 2509.67 s0001 EVEN THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE ITSELF 
VL-solklesm 2509.88 2511.76 s0001 IS ALSO LESS 
VL-solklesm 2511.77 2512.81 s0001 THEN THAT IS 
VL-solklesm 2512.82 2514.29 s0001 IN THE STANDARD R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 2514.29 2516.11 s0001 AND YOU ASK WHY 
VL-solklesm 2516.94 2520.40 s0001 I WOULD BRING YOU BACK TO VERY INTERESTING NOTION HERE 
VL-solklesm 2520.41 2524.00 s0001 JUST VISUALLY SPEAKING LOOK AT THE BLUE CURVE AND LOOK AT THE RED ONE 
VL-solklesm 2524.02 2527.33 s0001 WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE RED ONE IS SOME SORT OF SMOOTHING 
VL-solklesm 2527.34 2528.75 s0001 OF THE BLUE ONE 
VL-solklesm 2528.76 2532.65 s0001 I THINK IT'S NO THERE BECAUSE IT'S TAKING ALL OF THOSE HARD TURNS 
VL-solklesm 2532.65 2535.91 s0001 OUT OF A AND MAKING THEM INTO SOME SORT OF SLOPE 
VL-solklesm 2537.08 2538.46 s0001 SO 
VL-solklesm 2538.48 2542.14 s0001 THAT IS AN EXPECTED PIECE A RESULT AND IN FACT EIGHT 
VL-solklesm 2542.15 2545.35 s0001 IT SHOWS THAT OUR ASSUMPTION OF SIMILARITY 
VL-solklesm 2545.36 2548.79 s0001 ACTUALLY IS CAPTURED MUCH BETTER IN THIS MOOD 
VL-solklesm 2548.80 2550.22 s0001 R. O. C. CURVE 
VL-solklesm 2550.21 2552.29 s0001 THEN A DOZEN THE STANDARD OUR SEEKER 
VL-solklesm 2552.29 2555.08 s0001 BASICALLY THE STANDARD ARE WE SEE CURVE WOULD GIVE YOU 
VL-solklesm 2555.09 2556.82 s0001 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MODELS 
VL-solklesm 2556.82 2560.83 s0001 THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN THE MODEL THEMSELVES IS JUST DUE TO PLOTTING 
VL-solklesm 2560.84 2562.76 s0001 PROBLEMS AND THIS AGAIN 
VL-solklesm 2562.76 2564.26 s0001 IF YOU WANT TO INTERPRET IT 
VL-solklesm 2564.27 2565.85 s0001 IT'S THE PROBLEM WITH RANKING 
VL-solklesm 2565.85 2569.33 s0001 IF YOU'RE USING RANKING YOU HAVE NO DISTANCES BETWEEN POINTS 
VL-solklesm 2569.35 2570.63 s0001 BUT IF YOU SCORING 
VL-solklesm 2570.64 2573.08 s0001 YOU CONSIDER THIS COURSE YOU HAVE DISTANCED 
VL-solklesm 2573.19 2579.56 s0001 SO I HAVE ANOTHER EXPERIMENT WITH NINETY BASE ALONE BUT I DIDN'T HAVE IT HERE BECAUSE I HAD LESS TIME TO TALK 
VL-solklesm 2579.58 2583.63 s0001 BUT IF I HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME RESULTS FROM NINE FACE ALONE SO I 
VL-solklesm 2583.63 2584.90 s0001 DID THEM SEPARATELY 
VL-solklesm 2584.90 2586.51 s0001 BUT WHEN I PUT THEM TOGETHER 
VL-solklesm 2586.52 2587.60 s0001 OH I HAVE IT HERE 
VL-solklesm 2587.60 2589.58 s0001 OTHER GO TO PRICE PRICE 
VL-solklesm 2590.46 2596.00 s0001 UM AGAIN EXACTLY THE SAME THING THE STANDARD DEVIATION IN THIS MOOD R. O. C. SPACE IS A LOT LESS 
VL-solklesm 2596.02 2599.21 s0001 WITH TWO EXCEPTIONS HERE THAT THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE 
VL-solklesm 2599.21 2600.95 s0001 IN THIS MODE R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 2600.96 2602.23 s0001 IS ACTUALLY HIGHER FOR 
VL-solklesm 2602.23 2605.87 s0001 TWO DATA SETS YOU SEE WHERE THE CURVE THE RED CURVE GOES ABOVE 
VL-solklesm 2605.88 2608.36 s0001 THE BLUE CURVE IN THE BOTTOM GRAPH 
VL-solklesm 2608.40 2611.37 s0001 NOW YOU STEP BACK AND YOU ASK THE QUESTION WHY 
VL-solklesm 2612.32 2614.09 s0001 CAN YOU GUESS 
VL-solklesm 2618.41 2622.26 s0001 SMOOTHING THE OTHER WAY BUT IS THAT REALLY SMOOTHING 
VL-solklesm 2622.92 2626.02 s0001 SO IN STATISTICS THAT ACTUALLY MEAN SOMETHING 
VL-solklesm 2626.03 2630.41 s0001 IT'S THE CONCEPT OF HAVING A CALIBRATED SYSTEM BEEN REFINED 
VL-solklesm 2630.42 2631.94 s0001 AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
VL-solklesm 2632.73 2635.81 s0001 IN STATISTICS THEY ASSUMED CALIBRATION 
VL-solklesm 2636.12 2638.20 s0001 EXAMINE REFINEMENT 
VL-solklesm 2638.20 2641.39 s0001 THE IDEA OF REFINEMENT IS THAT WHEN YOU ESTIMATE PROBABILITIES TO 
VL-solklesm 2641.41 2642.55 s0001 DATA POINTS 
VL-solklesm 2642.55 2645.31 s0001 POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES YOU WANT THEM TO BE 
VL-solklesm 2645.31 2648.79 s0001 THE POSITIVES CLUSTERED HIGHER TOWARDS SOMEONE 
VL-solklesm 2648.80 2651.20 s0001 AND THE NEGATIVES TOWARDS ZERO 
VL-solklesm 2651.21 2654.03 s0001 SO IF YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF SEPARATION 
VL-solklesm 2654.04 2656.25 s0001 THAT'S CALLED A REFINED SYSTEM 
VL-solklesm 2656.26 2661.36 s0001 AND IN THESE TWO DATASET IF YOU LOOK AT THE CURVES I DON'T HAVE THEM HERE BUT I CAN SHOW THEM TO YOU IF YOU WANT 
VL-solklesm 2661.37 2664.12 s0001 THIS SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY VERY REFINED 
VL-solklesm 2664.12 2669.21 s0001 SO IT TURNS OUT THAT IT HAS A VERTICAL RISE FOLLOWED BY AND HIRES UNTIL RUN 
VL-solklesm 2669.22 2671.70 s0001 WITH WHICH IS THIS MOVING THE OTHER WAY 
VL-solklesm 2671.92 2677.19 s0001 AND THAT'S NINETEEN BASED NINETEEN BASED DOES THAT VERY FREQUENTLY BECAUSE IN KIDS 
VL-solklesm 2677.20 2678.43 s0001 HIGHER 
VL-solklesm 2678.45 2679.73 s0001 SCORES 
VL-solklesm 2679.73 2684.22 s0001 TO THE POSITIVE STAND IN DOES TO THE NEGATIVES THAT'S WHY IT'S AN EFFECTIVE CLASS OF FIRE 
VL-solklesm 2684.22 2689.27 s0001 YOU DRIVE ZERO POINT FIVE AND GUESS WHAT YOU'LL HAVE VERY NICE CLASSIFICATION RESULTS 
VL-solklesm 2689.28 2690.32 s0001 HOWEVER 
VL-solklesm 2690.33 2695.68 s0001 THESE SCORES ARE NOT NECESSARILY AS GOOD THEY'RE ACTUALLY SMOOTHER THE R. O. C. CANNOT TELL YOU THAT 
VL-solklesm 2695.69 2700.57 s0001 THE R. O. C. WILL SHOW YOU IN GENERAL ESTIMATED VIEW OF SMOOTH NETS 
VL-solklesm 2700.58 2703.71 s0001 BUT IT WON'T GIVE YOU SENSITIVITY TO SCORES 
VL-solklesm 2703.71 2704.76 s0001 AND THAT'S WHERE 
VL-solklesm 2704.77 2706.58 s0001 IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS 
VL-solklesm 2707.30 2709.77 s0001 IF YOU CONSIDER THE TWO TOGETHER 
VL-solklesm 2709.77 2710.83 s0001 YOU WILL SEE 
VL-solklesm 2710.84 2712.65 s0001 THEIR DIFFERENCES WITH 
VL-solklesm 2712.66 2715.29 s0001 I REALLY INTERESTING PIECE OF RESULTS AND THE ANT 
VL-solklesm 2715.29 2716.74 s0001 SO IN THE BOTTOM GRAPH 
VL-solklesm 2716.75 2719.75 s0001 I HAD THE ZERO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN I. A. BASE 
VL-solklesm 2719.76 2721.76 s0001 AND PROBABILITY ESTIMATING TREE 
VL-solklesm 2721.76 2723.41 s0001 AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 2723.42 2725.08 s0001 I'M TRYING TO DETERMINE 
VL-solklesm 2725.08 2726.35 s0001 WHETHER 
VL-solklesm 2726.35 2731.81 s0001 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE A. U. C. BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS IS IN FAVOUR OF NINETY BASE ABOVE 
VL-solklesm 2731.81 2733.00 s0001 OR 
VL-solklesm 2733.00 2735.29 s0001 PROBABILITY ESTIMATING TREE BELOW 
VL-solklesm 2735.30 2737.26 s0001 SO ABOVE THAT ZERO LINE 
VL-solklesm 2737.27 2738.40 s0001 TINY BASE 
VL-solklesm 2738.41 2739.89 s0001 MODEL HAS A HIGHER 
VL-solklesm 2739.90 2741.36 s0001 A U. C. 
VL-solklesm 2741.46 2743.47 s0001 AND PROBABILITY ESTIMATING TREE 
VL-solklesm 2743.47 2745.64 s0001 BELOW IT IT'S THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
VL-solklesm 2745.66 2748.16 s0001 NOW THE INTERESTING THING IS 
VL-solklesm 2748.32 2751.71 s0001 WHEN NINETEEN BASE WINS THE GAME 
VL-solklesm 2751.71 2754.86 s0001 APPARENTLY THE R. O. C. CANNOT DETECT IT 
VL-solklesm 2754.87 2758.44 s0001 BECAUSE IT KEEPS GOING UP AND DOWN AROUND THE ZERO 
VL-solklesm 2758.45 2763.96 s0001 THE SMOOTH OUR AS HE SEES IT VERY WELL BECAUSE IT'S SENSITIVE TO THIS REFINEMENT NOTION 
VL-solklesm 2763.96 2765.33 s0001 UP THE SCORES 
VL-solklesm 2765.34 2773.33 s0001 WHEREAS THE INTERESTING BUT A RESULT OF THAT WHEN PROBABILITY ESTIMATING TREE ACTUALLY COMES CLOSE TO THE SAME CLASSIFICATION AS NINETEEN PACE 
VL-solklesm 2773.33 2775.41 s0001 THE TWO OF THEM SAID HAND IN HAND 
VL-solklesm 2775.41 2777.05 s0001 WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU 
VL-solklesm 2777.06 2778.79 s0001 IT TELLS YOU THAT WHEN 
VL-solklesm 2778.80 2780.73 s0001 PROBABILITY ESTIMATING TREES 
VL-solklesm 2780.73 2782.63 s0001 PRODUCE GOOD CLASSIFICATION 
VL-solklesm 2782.64 2785.26 s0001 YOU ALSO HAVE VERY GOOD SCORES 
VL-solklesm 2785.27 2786.75 s0001 BUT WHEN YOU HAVE 
VL-solklesm 2786.76 2789.74 s0001 GOOD CLASSIFICATION FROM NINETY BASE ALONE 
VL-solklesm 2790.18 2792.85 s0001 THESE SCORES ARE NOT GOOD OR POOR 
VL-solklesm 2793.24 2795.58 s0001 AND THAT BASICALLY IS THE STORY THAT 
VL-solklesm 2795.59 2799.38 s0001 PEOPLE BEEN TRYING TO TELL IN THE PAST TEN YEARS ONE THEY EXAMINE THE TWO 
VL-solklesm 2799.38 2801.55 s0001 YOU CAN SEE IT ALL IN ONE POT HERE 
VL-solklesm 2801.56 2802.79 s0001 IN ONE EXPERIMENT 
VL-solklesm 2802.79 2804.00 s0001 AND AGAIN 
VL-solklesm 2804.01 2807.10 s0001 THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF COURSE WE ALREADY EXPLAINED UP 
VL-solklesm 2808.94 2810.38 s0001 SO BASICALLY 
VL-solklesm 2810.39 2811.57 s0001 WE CAN CONCLUDE 
VL-solklesm 2811.58 2812.71 s0001 WITH THIS IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 2812.72 2814.39 s0001 THIS TRUTH OUR O. C. CURVE 
VL-solklesm 2814.40 2817.58 s0001 IS MORE SENSITIVE TO THIS COURSE ASSIGNED TO THE 
VL-solklesm 2817.58 2818.98 s0001 TO BE DATA POINT 
VL-solklesm 2818.98 2821.49 s0001 THEN THE R. O. C. WHICH IS BY NOW 
VL-solklesm 2821.49 2823.03 s0001 OBVIOUS 
VL-solklesm 2823.03 2825.06 s0001 IT'S MORE SENSITIVE TO 
VL-solklesm 2825.06 2828.09 s0001 PERFORMANCE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BECAUSE 
VL-solklesm 2828.10 2830.51 s0001 WE BASICALLY INCREASED THE RESOLUTION 
VL-solklesm 2830.51 2833.46 s0001 OF PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT WE NOW CAN ACTUALLY 
VL-solklesm 2833.47 2837.16 s0001 LOOK INSIDE THE SQUARED ANTI R. O. C. CANNOT LOOK INSIDE 
VL-solklesm 2837.16 2841.31 s0001 THE R. O. C. HAS A POINT ON ONE END OF THE SQUARE AND THE OTHER END OF THE SQUARE 
VL-solklesm 2841.31 2842.50 s0001 AND SOMEHOW 
VL-solklesm 2842.51 2844.79 s0001 IN GUESSES THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM 
VL-solklesm 2844.80 2846.77 s0001 WE DON'T WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SLOPE 
VL-solklesm 2846.78 2851.11 s0001 IN BETWEEN AND THAT'S ADDED KNOWLEDGE WHICH EXTENDS THE WHOLE MATTER 
VL-solklesm 2851.96 2853.82 s0001 FOR SIMILARITIES 
VL-solklesm 2853.82 2855.72 s0001 THESE SMOOTH R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 2855.73 2859.91 s0001 THIS MOVE A YOU SEE ACTUALLY PRODUCES LOWER STANDARD DEVIATION AND 
VL-solklesm 2859.91 2862.28 s0001 BETTER AREA UNDER THE CURVE 
VL-solklesm 2862.68 2865.29 s0001 THE QUESTION THAT I AM IT IT SO FAR 
VL-solklesm 2865.30 2866.79 s0001 IS THE MAIN POINT 
VL-solklesm 2867.58 2869.26 s0001 WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS POINT 
VL-solklesm 2869.27 2873.34 s0001 HOW DO I GET THE MIDPOINT WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT 
VL-solklesm 2873.34 2874.97 s0001 WHEN YOU HAVE LABELS 
VL-solklesm 2874.98 2878.92 s0001 THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES IS VERY CLEAR 
VL-solklesm 2878.92 2881.17 s0001 YOU HAVE A PLUS AND MINUS RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 2881.28 2882.76 s0001 LINE IS RIGHT THERE 
VL-solklesm 2882.77 2885.97 s0001 BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SCORES ON LUNCH AREN'T THAT SO OBVIOUS 
VL-solklesm 2885.97 2892.18 s0001 RIGHT THERE IS A SPECIAL CASE OF SCORES WHEN YOU HAVE CALIBRATED SCORES IT'S NATURAL TO TAKE ZERO POINT FIVE 
VL-solklesm 2892.19 2894.43 s0001 SO IF YOU HAVE THE DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THEM 
VL-solklesm 2894.43 2898.14 s0001 CALIBRATED TO THE DATA POINTS THEN YOU LOOK FOR THE ZERO POINT FIVE 
VL-solklesm 2898.15 2901.06 s0001 AND THE PEAKS OF THE TWO DISTRIBUTIONS WILL ACTUALLY MATCH 
VL-solklesm 2901.06 2902.17 s0001 YOU GET IT THERE 
VL-solklesm 2902.18 2903.26 s0001 AND EVERYTHING'S FINE 
VL-solklesm 2903.26 2906.20 s0001 BUT WE ALL KNOW IN REALITY NOTHING IS CALIBRATED 
VL-solklesm 2906.20 2913.37 s0001 YOU ALWAYS WORK WITH THE SUB SAMPLE OF THE POPULATION THAT YOU'RE NOT EVEN SURE IF IT'S TRULY REPRESENTATIVE OR NOT OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THERE 
VL-solklesm 2913.38 2915.10 s0001 SO HOW DO WE CALCULATE THAT 
VL-solklesm 2915.10 2917.66 s0001 AND NOW I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THIS ISSUE WHICH 
VL-solklesm 2917.66 2919.91 s0001 I AM OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS 
VL-solklesm 2919.91 2923.12 s0001 AS TO HOW I FIND IT SO FAR I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M DOING 
VL-solklesm 2923.13 2925.37 s0001 WHAT I'M DOING IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE 
VL-solklesm 2925.92 2927.83 s0001 IS THE AVERAGE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 2927.84 2930.95 s0001 AND PLUS IS THE AVERAGE SCORE ON THE POSITIVE 
VL-solklesm 2930.96 2934.50 s0001 INSTANCES AND AND LINUS IS THE AVERAGE SCORE ON 
VL-solklesm 2934.51 2938.53 s0001 AND I WAITED MY C. C. IS THE CLASS DISTRIBUTION 
VL-solklesm 2938.53 2941.66 s0001 SO WHEN I HAVE A BALANCED A DESCENT 
VL-solklesm 2941.67 2943.34 s0001 THAT SEE IS ONE 
VL-solklesm 2943.34 2947.03 s0001 AND I BASICALLY TAKE THE AVERAGE THE AVERAGE FIND THE MIDPOINT AND BOOM 
VL-solklesm 2947.03 2948.43 s0001 THERE IS RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 2948.58 2954.84 s0001 IF IT'S IMBALANCE I JUST SHIFTED OVER TO THE SIDE BASED ON THE IMBALANCE OF THE DATASET 
VL-solklesm 2954.85 2956.95 s0001 THIS SEEMS TO BE INTUITIVE 
VL-solklesm 2956.96 2958.96 s0001 IT WORKS MOST OF THE TIME 
VL-solklesm 2958.97 2960.30 s0001 BUT 
VL-solklesm 2960.30 2963.77 s0001 WHAT I DIDN'T SHOW YOU IN THE IN THE PICTURE HERE IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 2963.77 2965.05 s0001 I ACTUALLY DO 
VL-solklesm 2965.05 2967.71 s0001 PERFECTLY NICE EQUALS 
VL-solklesm 2967.71 2970.06 s0001 SYMMETRIC TYPE AND DISTRIBUTION 
VL-solklesm 2970.07 2971.56 s0001 WHAT IF I HAD THIS 
VL-solklesm 2973.87 2977.68 s0001 WHAT IF I HAD THIS ONE WIDER THAN THE OTHER 
VL-solklesm 2978.02 2981.07 s0001 WELL THE CLASS DISTRIBUTION WILL ACTUALLY ACCOUNT FOR THIS 
VL-solklesm 2981.08 2982.77 s0001 BUT THIS IS THE HEADACHE 
VL-solklesm 2983.01 2984.54 s0001 SO IMAGINE 
VL-solklesm 2984.55 2986.18 s0001 ALL OF THE NEGATIVE SCORES 
VL-solklesm 2986.19 2987.23 s0001 BE IN 
VL-solklesm 2987.24 2988.68 s0001 CLUSTERED OVER 
VL-solklesm 2988.69 2990.00 s0001 CLOSE VALUES 
VL-solklesm 2990.01 2993.30 s0001 WITH A SUBSET OF THOSE THAT ARE VERY SPARSE AWAY FROM IT 
VL-solklesm 2994.10 2995.64 s0001 WHAT DO YOU DO AT THAT POINT 
VL-solklesm 2995.64 2997.53 s0001 WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'VE TRIED THAT 
VL-solklesm 2997.54 3005.35 s0001 AND IN SOME CASES THAT MIDPOINT COLLAPSES BECAUSE MATHEMATICALLY CAN PRODUCE A SET OF SCORES FOR WHICH THAT GREEN LINE IS ACTUALLY OVER ON THE SIDE 
VL-solklesm 3006.74 3010.66 s0001 IT HAS TO SIT SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THEM IF IT DOESN'T SIT IN BETWEEN 
VL-solklesm 3010.68 3012.02 s0001 I HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM 
VL-solklesm 3012.02 3014.40 s0031 BOTH A SECTION 
VL-solklesm 3015.61 3017.27 s0031 THIS TO US 
VL-solklesm 3017.28 3018.72 s0031 HERE 
VL-solklesm 3018.73 3019.64 s0031 BUT 
VL-solklesm 3019.64 3020.24 s0001 OH 
VL-solklesm 3021.40 3025.60 s0001 A IF I DIDN'T HAVE INTERSECTION THEN I HAVE NOTHING TO ANALYSE 
VL-solklesm 3025.61 3027.79 s0001 RIGHT SO I JUST GO HOME 
VL-solklesm 3027.80 3029.67 s0001 I DON'T PLAY WITH IT ALL 
VL-solklesm 3029.67 3031.00 s0001 RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 3031.00 3039.62 s0001 I MEAN THAT COULD BE THE MIDPOINT THE MIDPOINT COULD BE OUTSIDE THE INTERSECTION AND NASA WHOLE PROBLEM IT'S EVEN WORSE IT CAN BE OUTSIDE BOTH DISTRIBUTIONS 
VL-solklesm 3039.63 3041.80 s0001 RIGHT BECAUSE I'M TAKING THE AVERAGE 
VL-solklesm 3041.81 3047.64 s0001 NOW THE SUGGESTION I HAVE SO FAR IN WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO TRY IS TAKING THE MEDIUM INSTEAD OF THE AVERAGE 
VL-solklesm 3047.80 3049.90 s0001 THE MEDIAN MIGHT GIVE ME 
VL-solklesm 3049.91 3051.17 s0001 A GOOD 
VL-solklesm 3051.17 3052.85 s0001 POSITION FOR THE MIDPOINT 
VL-solklesm 3052.86 3053.96 s0001 HOWEVER 
VL-solklesm 3053.97 3056.45 s0001 I AM ACTUALLY EXPLORING OTHER WAYS OF 
VL-solklesm 3056.46 3059.88 s0001 CALCULATING THIS MIDPOINT BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT 
VL-solklesm 3059.89 3061.31 s0001 THIS ASSIGNMENT OF 
VL-solklesm 3061.31 3064.06 s0001 APPROPRIATE VERSUS INAPPROPRIATE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 3064.07 3066.78 s0001 IS VERY SENSITIVE TO WHERE YOU PUT THIS POINT RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 3066.79 3069.49 s0001 SO YOU WANT THIS POINT TO BE AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE 
VL-solklesm 3069.49 3072.16 s0001 SO THE NEXT APPROACH I WOULD LIKE TO TRY 
VL-solklesm 3072.17 3073.61 s0001 IS TO LEARN 
VL-solklesm 3073.62 3074.78 s0001 THIS MEANT POINT 
VL-solklesm 3074.79 3077.67 s0001 SO IMAGINE I HAD A HIGH QUALITY DATA SET 
VL-solklesm 3077.68 3079.08 s0001 FROM AND DISTRIBUTION 
VL-solklesm 3079.09 3081.72 s0001 RIGHT THAT HAS SCORES AND IT 
VL-solklesm 3081.72 3084.64 s0001 AND FROM THERE I CAN ESTIMATE THE MIDPOINT 
VL-solklesm 3084.83 3086.61 s0001 ONCE I DO THIS FRONT 
VL-solklesm 3086.62 3089.83 s0001 I GET MY MIDPOINT AND I TOSS AWAY EVERYTHING I LEARNED 
VL-solklesm 3089.85 3091.47 s0001 I JUST KEEP THE MIDPOINT 
VL-solklesm 3091.47 3099.98 s0001 AND THEN I BUILD A MODEL THAT I WANT TO APPLY THE MIDPOINT SO THE IDEAS THAT CAN I LEARNED THIS MEAN POINT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN WHICH COULD BE DOABLE 
VL-solklesm 3099.99 3103.57 s0001 FOR APPROPRIATE TYPE OF DOMAINS UM 
VL-solklesm 3103.57 3104.85 s0001 OTHER THAN THAT 
VL-solklesm 3104.85 3107.06 s0001 I COULD RUN A VALIDATION FACE 
VL-solklesm 3107.06 3109.06 s0001 WHERE I DO TRAINING 
VL-solklesm 3109.06 3110.96 s0001 AND I HAVE ANOTHER 
VL-solklesm 3110.97 3117.68 s0001 HOLDOUT SET FROM THE TRAINING OVER WHICH I ACTUALLY DETERMINE THE MIDPOINT TAKE THE MIDPOINT AND APPLY IT INTO TESTING 
VL-solklesm 3117.69 3119.03 s0001 SO THAT'S ANOTHER APPROACH 
VL-solklesm 3119.04 3120.23 s0001 AND OF COURSE THEY'RE ALL 
VL-solklesm 3120.24 3121.37 s0001 AND THIS POINT HERE 
VL-solklesm 3121.38 3122.96 s0001 UM OPEN ENDED 
VL-solklesm 3122.97 3125.10 s0001 WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT WITH IT 
VL-solklesm 3125.10 3128.12 s0001 ANOTHER THING WHICH I DON'T HAVE AN THIS 
VL-solklesm 3128.12 3129.73 s0001 PRESENTATION HERE 
VL-solklesm 3129.73 3132.84 s0001 THE REASON IS BECAUSE I WANT TO WRITE ANOTHER PAPER ABOUT IT IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 3132.84 3135.58 s0001 IF YOU STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT I THINK 
VL-solklesm 3135.59 3138.38 s0001 PAUL BENNETT WROTE A TECHNICAL REPORT 
VL-solklesm 3138.38 3143.18 s0001 TALKING ABOUT THE CALL THEM THE PROBLEM HE WAS DEALING WITH MISS CLASSIFICATION COST 
VL-solklesm 3143.19 3151.33 s0001 RIGHT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY CAME ACROSS IS THAT THE PROBABILITY ESTIMATION FOR A GIVEN DOMAIN IS USUALLY SENSITIVE BY THIS MIDPOINT 
VL-solklesm 3151.33 3153.05 s0001 WHERE THE OVERLAP 
VL-solklesm 3153.06 3154.16 s0001 IT'S RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 3154.16 3155.60 s0001 AND THE FUNNY PART IS THAT 
VL-solklesm 3155.61 3157.85 s0001 IF YOU BUILD A MODEL ON THIS DISTRIBUTION 
VL-solklesm 3157.86 3161.73 s0001 YOU SAMPLE DATA FROM D. STEW WITH THIS GIVEN MIDPOINT 
VL-solklesm 3162.17 3166.93 s0001 AND THEN SOMEHOW SOMETIME LATER YOU GOOD TESTED AND EAST TO SHIFT 
VL-solklesm 3166.94 3169.45 s0001 THINGS CHANGE THEY GO APART 
VL-solklesm 3169.46 3171.29 s0001 IF THEY GO PARTNER STATES 
VL-solklesm 3171.30 3173.62 s0001 BECAUSE THE MIDPOINT STILL SITS IN BETWEEN 
VL-solklesm 3173.63 3177.76 s0001 BUT THIS MAY POINT IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THIS DOMAIN 
VL-solklesm 3177.76 3181.07 s0001 WHICH ACTUALLY TELLS YOU THAT MY ENTIRE APPROACH 
VL-solklesm 3181.08 3184.84 s0001 COULD BE VERY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN UNDERLYING DO ME 
VL-solklesm 3184.84 3186.14 s0001 RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 3186.15 3196.67 s0001 AND THIS TURNS OUT TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL IN DETECTING CHANGES IN DATA DISTRIBUTIONS SO NOW WE'RE NOT EVALUATING THE MODEL WE TAKE A SNAPSHOT OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE NOW 
VL-solklesm 3196.67 3201.64 s0001 AND TAKE ANOTHER SUCH A SNAPSHOT TWENTY YEARS LATER SEE THINGS CHANGED 
VL-solklesm 3201.65 3208.05 s0001 RIGHT WHEN THINGS CHANGE IN THE DOMAIN PRESUMABLY THE MODEL THAT YOU TRAINED ABOUT POINT IS NO LONGER GOOD 
VL-solklesm 3208.05 3213.37 s0001 RIGHT SO IT TURNS OUT THAT WE HAVE AN EXTRA ADVANTAGE IN THIS MOOD R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 3213.37 3218.35 s0001 CURVE IS THAT IT'S SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING DOMAIN WHICH MEANS 
VL-solklesm 3218.36 3220.16 s0001 THAT CURVE WILL CHANGE 
VL-solklesm 3220.17 3223.92 s0001 BASED ON DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TRAINING AND TESTING 
VL-solklesm 3223.93 3229.35 s0001 SO NOW I STEP ASIDE AND I TELL YOU THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF DATA 
VL-solklesm 3229.35 3232.30 s0001 IMAGINE YOU HAVE MULTIPLE SAMPLES FROM THE DOMAIN 
VL-solklesm 3232.30 3235.21 s0001 AND YOU WANT TO VERIFY THAT INDEED 
VL-solklesm 3235.22 3237.24 s0001 YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME 
VL-solklesm 3237.24 3241.83 s0001 RIGHT YOU CAN BUILD CURVES FOR IT AND SEE IF THEY MATCH IF THEY DON'T MATCH 
VL-solklesm 3241.84 3244.03 s0001 IT COULD BE LIKELY THAT 
VL-solklesm 3244.04 3247.62 s0001 SAMPLES CONVEY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE DOMAIN 
VL-solklesm 3247.63 3249.82 s0001 AND MAYBE A MIXTURE OF THOSE WOULD BE 
VL-solklesm 3249.82 3251.25 s0001 I DEAL FOR TRAINING 
VL-solklesm 3251.25 3255.19 s0001 SO CAN YOU IDENTIFY A SUB SAMPLE OF A DOMAIN 
VL-solklesm 3255.19 3257.11 s0001 APPROPRIATE FOR TRAINING A MODEL 
VL-solklesm 3257.12 3259.54 s0001 AT THIS POINT AND THIS IS WORK THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE 
VL-solklesm 3259.55 3260.77 s0001 YEAH 
VL-solklesm 3260.77 3262.60 s0001 SO I GET 
VL-solklesm 3262.61 3268.37 s0001 THE FUTURE IS BUSY LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PUTTING UP WITH ME I THINK UM FINISHED 
VL-solklesm 3268.40 3268.94 s0001 OH 
VL-solklesm 3268.94 3275.02 s0031 I 
VL-solklesm 3275.03 3277.30 s0031 OR SO 
VL-solklesm 3277.30 3278.80 s0031 HMMM 
VL-solklesm 3278.94 3281.67 s0031 YOU KNOW THESE ARE 
VL-solklesm 3281.68 3283.83 s0031 YOU PROBABLY KNOW A 
VL-solklesm 3283.84 3285.03 s0031 OH YEAH 
VL-solklesm 3285.04 3286.86 s0031 HOW THEY HOW 
VL-solklesm 3286.87 3288.60 s0031 BUT ALL YOUR 
VL-solklesm 3288.61 3291.62 s0031 YOU WILL BE ALL SCHOOLS 
VL-solklesm 3291.69 3295.60 s0031 SO YOU'RE A BUT IT USES 
VL-solklesm 3295.61 3299.22 s0031 SO SOMEHOW 
VL-solklesm 3299.22 3301.55 s0031 HOW THEY DO 
VL-solklesm 3301.56 3303.10 s0031 NEXT 
VL-solklesm 3303.11 3304.52 s0031 COMPONENTS REACH 
VL-solklesm 3304.53 3307.53 s0031 ONCE YOU WANT TO BE 
VL-solklesm 3307.54 3309.45 s0031 A FEW PEOPLE WHO EAT 
VL-solklesm 3309.86 3311.63 s0031 THEIR SPORES 
VL-solklesm 3311.63 3313.16 s0031 SO THAT 
VL-solklesm 3313.16 3315.56 s0031 SO THE EXPENSE 
VL-solklesm 3315.56 3316.88 s0031 USE 
VL-solklesm 3316.88 3318.87 s0031 ALSO WE WON'T 
VL-solklesm 3318.87 3320.00 s0031 I 
VL-solklesm 3320.00 3320.65 s0001 OH 
VL-solklesm 3320.87 3323.31 s0001 THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY EASY 
VL-solklesm 3323.46 3325.58 s0001 SURPRISINGLY EASY 
VL-solklesm 3326.84 3329.27 s0001 PATHETICALLY EASY I WOULD SAY 
VL-solklesm 3329.99 3334.54 s0001 SEE THERE IS AN INTERESTING THING IF YOU WERE IF YOU GO BACK TO THE R. C. SPACE 
VL-solklesm 3334.54 3339.59 s0001 THEY ARE A SPECIES A. R. C. SPACE HAS THIS CONCEPT OF THE R. O. C. CONVEX HALL 
VL-solklesm 3339.59 3345.99 s0001 AND PETER PLUCKED DID A LOT OF WORK ON REPAIRING WHAT'S CALLED KING CAVITIES THIS IS A CAN CAVITY INTO THE R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 3346.00 3348.86 s0001 AND YOU REPAIR IT IN HIS CASE HE'S WHAT THAT IS 
VL-solklesm 3348.86 3351.10 s0001 RIGHT AND YOU EFFECTIVELY FIX THE RANKING 
VL-solklesm 3351.11 3357.06 s0001 SWAP THE TWO WHO CARES ABOUT THE SCORES WERE NOT USING THEM ANYWAYS AND YOU GET AN NICELY CONVEX 
VL-solklesm 3357.06 3358.15 s0001 CURVE 
VL-solklesm 3358.16 3360.14 s0001 AND THEORETICALLY SPEAKING 
VL-solklesm 3360.15 3361.83 s0001 IF YOU TAKE THE CONVEX HULL 
VL-solklesm 3361.83 3366.84 s0001 IT TURNS OUT THAT THE SLOPE OF THE LINE SEGMENT IS ACTUALLY BEEN LIKELIHOOD 
VL-solklesm 3366.85 3368.86 s0001 OF THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE 
VL-solklesm 3368.86 3371.42 s0001 BEING A MEMBER IN THAT CLASS 
VL-solklesm 3371.43 3376.10 s0001 SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS REPAIR CAN CAVITIES ALONG THE R. O. C. 
VL-solklesm 3376.21 3383.55 s0001 READ OFF THE VALUE OF THOSE SCORES AND YOU GOTTA SETUP CALIBRATED PROBABILITIES AS WELL IN FACT 
VL-solklesm 3383.55 3386.46 s0001 IN IN A ROW SEE SPACE IF YOU WANT TO TELL 
VL-solklesm 3386.47 3388.10 s0001 HOW FAR OFF 
VL-solklesm 3388.10 3389.64 s0001 AND GIVEN MODEL 
VL-solklesm 3389.65 3391.74 s0001 IS FROM CALIBRATION 
VL-solklesm 3391.75 3395.13 s0001 YOU'D RATHER COMPLEX HALL AND YOU SEE THE GAP BETWEEN THEM 
VL-solklesm 3395.14 3396.35 s0001 RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 3396.35 3397.51 s0001 SO GETTING 
VL-solklesm 3397.52 3399.50 s0001 THOSE LIKELIHOOD IS NO PROBLEM 
VL-solklesm 3399.50 3400.70 s0001 HOWEVER 
VL-solklesm 3400.70 3402.05 s0001 THERE'S A PROBLEM 
VL-solklesm 3402.05 3403.29 s0001 IMAGINE 
VL-solklesm 3403.29 3405.87 s0001 YOU DID HAVE A CONVEX CURVE 
VL-solklesm 3405.88 3409.29 s0001 YOU YOU'RE NOT GUARANTEED THAT THIS PARTICULAR 
VL-solklesm 3409.98 3411.51 s0001 COMPLEXITY 
VL-solklesm 3411.52 3413.46 s0001 IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO THE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 3413.47 3417.78 s0001 IN MAYBE AN OVERESTIMATE OR UNDERESTIMATE IN E. R. O. C. SPACE 
VL-solklesm 3417.78 3420.43 s0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SAY NAH HOW 
VL-solklesm 3420.43 3423.05 s0001 WHO AH YES 
VL-solklesm 3423.05 3424.26 s0031 HOW DO YOU NEED 
VL-solklesm 3424.27 3426.06 s0031 I MEAN UH 
VL-solklesm 3426.07 3426.94 s0031 THESE ARE THE BEST 
VL-solklesm 3426.94 3427.48 s0001 OH 
VL-solklesm 3428.54 3431.59 s0001 OH YOU YOU LEARNED ON THE TRAINING SET 
VL-solklesm 3431.59 3433.52 s0001 AND YOU APPLY IT ON THE TEST 
VL-solklesm 3433.53 3434.81 s0001 THAT'S THE TRICK 
VL-solklesm 3434.82 3440.75 s0001 AND YOU APPLIED AND THAT'S WHERE THE OVER UNDERESTIMATION WELL ACTUALLY HAPPENED IS BECAUSE THE R. O. C. OVER THERE 
VL-solklesm 3440.76 3442.97 s0001 GIVES YOU WAY TOO MUCH LEEWAY 
VL-solklesm 3442.98 3445.72 s0001 THE SLOPE IS FREEDOM GOAL 
VL-solklesm 3445.72 3448.26 s0001 BASED ON EQUAL WEIGHTS OR 
VL-solklesm 3448.27 3453.69 s0001 WHATEVER THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS YOU HAVE YES I'M TALKING ABOUT THE USUAL R. C. 
VL-solklesm 3453.70 3455.28 s0001 AS SOON AS I GO INTO MINE 
VL-solklesm 3455.29 3461.84 s0001 THE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BECAUSE OF THE RESOLUTION OF THE SCORE 
VL-solklesm 3461.85 3466.68 s0001 ALL I WOULD HAVE TO DO TO GET YOU SEE THE COMPLEX WHOLE TO THIS CURVE WOULD BE HERE 
VL-solklesm 3466.69 3469.38 s0001 BARELY OFF CALIBRATION 
VL-solklesm 3469.38 3471.39 s0001 I'M NOT TOO FAR OFF CALIBRATION 
VL-solklesm 3471.39 3472.76 s0001 WHEREAS THIS ONE 
VL-solklesm 3472.77 3474.17 s0001 IT'S OFF HERE 
VL-solklesm 3474.17 3476.48 s0001 IT'S A FAIR AND IT'S OFF THERE 
VL-solklesm 3476.48 3479.35 s0001 RIGHT SO THIS IF YOU WERE TO CALIBRATED 
VL-solklesm 3479.36 3481.04 s0001 WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE YOU PERFECT 
VL-solklesm 3481.05 3489.31 s0001 SO THE SCORES HE WOULD READ LIKELIHOOD SCORES HE WOULD READ OUT OF THIS COMPLEX HALL WOULD BE ONE ONE ZERO POINT FIVE ZERO ZERO 
VL-solklesm 3489.32 3491.47 s0001 RIGHT WHEREAS HERE 
VL-solklesm 3491.48 3494.82 s0001 THE VALUES HE WOULD READ ACTUALLY CLOSER TO 
VL-solklesm 3494.83 3496.20 s0001 WHAT YOU GET 
VL-solklesm 3496.20 3500.30 s0001 IN THE SCORING SO THIS IS MORE SENSITIVE TO THE MODEL ITSELF 
VL-solklesm 3500.30 3501.59 s0001 THEN THIS ONE 
VL-solklesm 3501.59 3504.46 s0001 NOW MOST GIVE YOU CALIBRATE ITS COURSE HOWEVER 
VL-solklesm 3504.47 3506.39 s0001 HAVING SAID THAT 
VL-solklesm 3506.40 3511.44 s0001 THERE IS A VERY INTERESTING OBSERVATION I MADE THERE AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS 
VL-solklesm 3511.44 3512.51 s0001 YET 
VL-solklesm 3512.52 3513.91 s0001 I KNOW WHY 
VL-solklesm 3513.99 3515.93 s0001 I KNOW IT'S EFFECT 
VL-solklesm 3515.95 3517.54 s0001 I CAN REPRODUCE IT 
VL-solklesm 3517.55 3518.99 s0001 AND IT MAKES SENSE 
VL-solklesm 3518.99 3521.43 s0001 BUT WHAT IT MEANS I STILL DON'T KNOW 
VL-solklesm 3521.45 3522.95 s0001 SEE 
VL-solklesm 3522.95 3526.72 s0001 LOOK AT THE DECISION I HAVE THREE POSITIVES THREE NEGATIVES 
VL-solklesm 3526.73 3528.04 s0001 RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 3528.05 3531.92 s0001 AND UNFORTUNATELY OH NO THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE ACTUALLY 
VL-solklesm 3531.93 3534.89 s0001 IF YOU WERE TO CALIBRATE THESE SCORES 
VL-solklesm 3534.90 3541.44 s0001 IT'S NATURAL TO TAKE ZERO POINT FIVE AS A CUTOFF POINT BETWEEN NEGATIVES AND POSITIVES RIGHT THAT'S WHAT CALIBRATION GIVES YOU 
VL-solklesm 3541.45 3545.76 s0001 IT FIXES THE MIDPOINT AND DISTRIBUTES THE DATA POINTS AROUND 
VL-solklesm 3545.76 3548.32 s0001 IF I WERE TO TAKE ZERO POINT FIVE OVER THERE 
VL-solklesm 3548.33 3552.25 s0001 I ACTUALLY END UP WITH FOUR POSITIVES AND TUNING ITS 
VL-solklesm 3552.77 3557.07 s0001 BECAUSE THAT ZERO POINT FIVE ONE IS ABOVE IS JUST ABOVE 
VL-solklesm 3557.08 3563.01 s0001 AND WHAT HAPPENS HERE I HAVE A DISCREPANCY IN THE CLASS DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE TWO 
VL-solklesm 3563.02 3564.79 s0001 CRITERIA IF YOU WILL 
VL-solklesm 3564.80 3567.24 s0001 LABEL SAYS THREE IN THREE 
VL-solklesm 3567.25 3569.81 s0001 SCORE SAYS FOR INTO 
VL-solklesm 3570.10 3573.75 s0001 VISUALLY THIS PRODUCES A SLIGHT ROTATION 
VL-solklesm 3573.76 3575.63 s0001 WHEN YOU GO TO CALIBRATE 
VL-solklesm 3576.05 3579.63 s0001 I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS AND I JUST CONFESSED IT 
VL-solklesm 3579.64 3586.25 s0001 IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF SCORES IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE DISTRIBUTION OF LABELS RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 3586.26 3589.94 s0001 BUT BY THE TIME YOU CALIBRATE THEM BE BE EFFECTIVE 
VL-solklesm 3589.95 3592.12 s0001 CALIBRATION ON MY CURVE 
VL-solklesm 3592.14 3594.94 s0001 IS ACTUALLY A VERY SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF WORK BECAUSE 
VL-solklesm 3594.95 3597.57 s0001 ONCE I FIGURE OUT WHY THIS ROTATION IS THERE 
VL-solklesm 3597.58 3599.44 s0001 IN BE VERY INTERESTING 
VL-solklesm 3599.44 3602.94 s0001 TO SOLVE AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH 
VL-solklesm 3602.95 3606.70 s0001 CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING DOMAIN YOU GET A LOT OF ROTATIONS 
VL-solklesm 3606.71 3611.14 s0001 BECAUSE THE BALANCE CHANGES THAT'S HOW THE R. O. C. DETECTS CHANGES IN 
VL-solklesm 3611.15 3612.94 s0001 IN DATA DISTRIBUTIONS 
VL-solklesm 3612.95 3614.81 s0001 IS THAT YOU SAMPLED IT AT 
VL-solklesm 3614.82 3620.29 s0001 TEN OUT OF A HUNDRED MANY SAMPLE IT AGAIN AT THIRTY OUT OF A HUNDRED ALL THERE IS 
VL-solklesm 3620.30 3623.07 s0001 CLASS IMBALANCE BUT THE R. O. C. IS ACTUALLY 
VL-solklesm 3623.07 3626.11 s0001 VERY PRACTICAL AND IGNORING THESE THINGS 
VL-solklesm 3626.12 3629.08 s0001 BECAUSE THE THE DECREASING DIAGONAL 
VL-solklesm 3629.09 3634.19 s0001 IS THE BALANCE DATASET ANYTHING BELOW IT YOU HAVE MORE NEGATIVES THAN POSITIVES 
VL-solklesm 3634.20 3635.41 s0001 ANYTHING ABOVE IT 
VL-solklesm 3635.42 3637.90 s0001 YOU HAVE MORE POSITIVES THAN NEGATIVES RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 3637.90 3648.66 s0001 SO THE IDEA IS THAT YOU DRAW THIS AND YOU JUST FIGURE OUT FOR MINE GIVEN BALANCE WHICH POINT ON THE R. O. C. SHOULD I USE AND THOSE ARE CALLED THE OPERATING POINTS ON THE R. O. C. KERR RIGHT 
VL-solklesm 3648.66 3651.60 s0001 OVER HERE IT'S NOT SO OBVIOUS 
VL-solklesm 3651.61 3653.25 s0001 BECAUSE THIS 
VL-solklesm 3654.15 3660.57 s0001 DECREASE IN DIAGONAL IS NOW THE BALANCE BETWEEN APPROPRIATE AND INAPPROPRIATE 
VL-solklesm 3660.57 3666.47 s0001 BECAUSE REMEMBER THE SEPARATION IS APPROPRIATE SCORES PURSES INAPPROPRIATE SCORES AND APPROPRIATE SCORES 
VL-solklesm 3666.48 3669.97 s0001 GO ACROSS BOTH SETS THE POSITIVES AND THE NEGATIVES 
VL-solklesm 3669.98 3673.07 s0001 AND SAME THING HAPPENS ON THE ON THE X. AXES 
VL-solklesm 3673.08 3675.27 s0001 SO THE BALANCE BETWEEN THEM 
VL-solklesm 3675.28 3677.59 s0001 IS WHAT CAUSES THAT BROKE ROTATION 
VL-solklesm 3677.60 3679.43 s0001 IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE 
VL-solklesm 3679.43 3682.29 s0001 MATHEMATICALLY THEORETICALLY AND VISUALLY 
VL-solklesm 3682.30 3686.59 s0001 BUT WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN WHEN YOU GO BACK TO PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT 
VL-solklesm 3686.59 3689.01 s0001 YOU HAVE AN IDEA POLICED ONLY
