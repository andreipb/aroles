Description
The quest for better superconductors, with higher transition temperatures that perform at higher magnetic fields 
and lead to higher critical currents is one of the major challenges in condensed matter physics. In the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer 
theory of superconductivity, electrons form Cooper pairs as a result of an interaction mediated by vibrations in the underlying 
crystal structure (phonons). In my talk I will review different experimental techniques which allow an evaluation of the strength
of the interaction between electrons and phonons. The theoretical constraints for an unconventional superconductivity caused by 
repulsive interaction will be also discussed.
