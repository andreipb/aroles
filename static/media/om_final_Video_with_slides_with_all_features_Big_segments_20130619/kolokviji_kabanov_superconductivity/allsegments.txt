he he's 

okay 

sevilla prison 

something involved 

my favourite subject 

and 

michael you'll enjoy 

a little bit 

at least just part 

so ah 

my interest so 

for convict elitist answer 

when i was graduate student the 

student 

the coherent 

in russia's a system for education is like there's a lot of severe you could choose 

subject modern have subject issue of 

specialised and 

our teacher in quantum mechanics 

otherwise me 

to try super can that eat 

the time 

and button toes form 

established to these universities probably is only one 

in the world department of superconducting eighteen 

well 

the main purpose was to 

educate 

sufficient eastern superconducting to because 

at the time or energy 

he superconducting magnets 

they want to use it for 

in different areas like i dunno 

accelerators 

and the suspicion before 

fusion bookmarks 

and the base for or or studies of superconducting to base his digital switch of institute 

so that's how i become aware of both superconducting it is of course saying you a little bit before but 

that's 

okay 

song 

my talk will be 

mostly 

historical overview and them 

i'm still a little bit of what we have in our department

 

so 

as you know you're wrong 

last year it was kind of india's of it earlier scenario of scholars who can that it 

which was done by cameron come on this in 

a lion 

a labor of light light in a university 

in a 

a neverland 

and the 

of course before discovered super connectivity he toast 

or a big if i 

lincoln p. room 

in 

nineteen oh eight 

so that means of 

well low temperature physics as it is it stuff that 

three years before 

probably one of the most something in part full temperature physics is 

super connectivity 

so many kick left of discovery of 

a super connectivity he 

got moment price 

it was the first moment bryson super can the community 

in total 

a few super connectivity it well let's say super convict in again and super freed 

it was awarded

 

seven of the prices 

five in super connectivity and fire the two in 

the field of super fruit eating 

and the 

the lost 

six of them 

of course the water tins the last forty years 

so starting from b. c. s. which was a little concerned to whom 

joseph's own 

brian jones of some validity in 

so in two three and them 

it's um 

first discovered of super medium 

and 

i'll kill later 

about this 

so true 

the 

you already interest to 

cox world scholarship in that period

 

and then when you read about it and from europe 

look what kind of problems they said to solve the plan 

it's mean really 

mom video because 

first of all it was no helium 

four 

these small of work as a gift to get somewhere here you'll 

if you look oz a book you guessed he doing it 

it's a new 

very interesting started because a 

first of all to try to get helium from stones from iceland 

just break stones 

and try to collect enough of helium 

no way it didn't work 

so they collected 

thick and thin sixty need helium gas 

only after a 

the 

the 

it's some additional sales from norse carolina arrived

 

and you can dimensions a hundred and sixty acres of humans are just just have 

and ah for many years slide rule the world was just one level that image had league q. therefore for example 

in the first twenty years 

i mean vast majority of publications of flow all on the subject afloat and which is just come from his wallet 

that's the reason why most discovered this in this field including for example like a quantum oscillations but it's just

 

everything from here 

and a fan 

the main problem which the most since the feel the super in do so let's see sort of state physics or low temperature physics flaws 

ah 

a house is due to be here in that low temperature 

what is it 

start to roll start to 

draw or 

mean constant 

therefore the first type of measurement they decided to good use as a measurements of was deleted from a simple measurements of course 

ah 

can link once kept his own agenda there would say he 

have a ideas 

and he's sort of each heap unify 

well materials 

they become superconducting 

this isn't like you start this platinum gold 

he did measurements no supercomputing nothing was founded just 

the super to the a. is due to doing a little constant 

they decided to 

the measurements only okay 

that's very large decision 

but the arguments wisely choose medical universe 

regional jail because it was very easy to beautiful right 

much more reason some other 

materials 

so like was 

because 

you know novels of critical temperature for america is very close to woman parental for of law

 

he do so 

it could go temperature made trees about a four point fifteen kellen 

and for bone and point is a world though issues about four point two 

so um 

they did just measurements 

and to me because i found that 

ah 

his duties you know 

no way it is a short circuit in those in our so krause tougher 

has anybody could repeatedly pleaded measurements many many pants 

but 

i mean do 

a samples a useless in such a you should adjust poor 

them and clean it it was to apply to live sons a measure 

this is due to exit 

so 

to avoid sure sure sure check it was a

 

change the shape of the sample survey 

made in the devil in the shape 

but it didn't help 

the measurements oregon i sneeze a fuller late 

they keep all this pressure in the crest of 

below atmospheric pressure 

because he was expensive 

so ah 

and of course the incoming oxygen and nitrogen just poor also paulson's a crust up films a citizen rise again was a huge room 

but since 

pressure was low 

i won't go into a went down 

and the a bomb 

as it is also all this measurements american it was always 

under critical temperature services to dozier 

just accident 

filled them so 

kind of a financial system 

once do they use a u. student to keep where were a low pressure visitors a should further 

fall we took a little of for some oil in some device 

and for some reason one student was not careful enough and per se start to grow 

and he was invited along comes a child

 

but it can also measurements was done by holes giles host not 

the middle as being doing measurements 

every single numbers is he was a source who missed supercomputing 

resistance 

he was in the in room made living room 

and student reported suppression of my 

it shouldn't went up and he immediately saw it in years 

so that's how it was

 

discovered 

a what was interesting is that 

yeah 

in all publications 

it was only one also 

kind of incontinence 

no mentioning of 

ah 

i mean great he's he's he was a philips afterwards 

but no ill 

the acknowledgement 

so 

as a 

a archiving of a newborn 

usually two hundred lines from a philosophical conclusion 

philosophical conclusion is not only earth 

ah the the 

no technological advances in the last hundred years ago but also some changes in there 

poor so full session 

sometimes now 

what does a 

become aware that there are all sorts of some paper just after papers published

 

especially as a as far as the sample grosses consoled 

and sometimes a list of project 

and they're saying no no i have nothing to do is is if 

that's christopher told missus example once 

so 

but it's not a discovery superconducting eighty in medical 

it was discovered is due to ming other samples 

including team and lead 

hmmm also 

i should mention that 

this level that it was very close to discover for myself 

my state of something 

they again because it was very it 

little of helium 

it's a deep measurements older 

call oh 

a racing if seeing a whole a sample of fur super conductor 

and it is known that 

well there 

here is because very single nobles there is a special german of currents 

which it reduces redstone who my statistic 

so 

just because as you six of them they didn't discuss a maestro something that it 

but er 

they discovered many sinks like the use of the reserve my as a measure 

and 

mister a supercomputer so they introduce critical currently interviews

 

critical fields of these are so to magnetic field used to put in the future 

and what is interesting 

that's a 

rawness 

he believed that 

steele 

if we make 

middle's cute enough 

lingered superconducting 

so in his nominal each he said that 

yeah 

he's no adults that eve 

platinum and 

ah 

a gold 

a few of these 

made a 

clean enough 

they have a super conductor 

the next stage 

comes a 

in sodas 

when 

my sniff it was discovered must if it means that the 

super conductors are 

ideal 

obama medics is a 

ah 

how to say yeah 

they don't like 

magnetic field in a havana 

a boardroom they feel it 

so ah 

this effect was discovered 

and because and they might affect and now 

when we do any measurement some super conductors 

if you vote approves this is a view super conductor switch to shore to sinks 

one think easier 

obama nudism have to show of the co for when it is ancient 

and just to show because of his estate is in resistance 

and my statistic 

ah and the 

it was clear that it is different from a 

the ideal metals 

and ah 

tracing science loan them 

they rolled in logical equation 

in thirty six or seventy eight 

ah ah 

because he secretions actually pretty simple 

if i just assumed that flow 

my super fruit 

but um one 

touche superconducting components of these older equation it means of ideal floor 

they're on a london accretion means that i don't have a variety city

 

so notice in the flow 

means sloan immigration 

just 

simple right into for owner equations you can see that if it was of these per physical to do this exactly 

as the same as on the creation 

some of the results appeared first 

from the mental continues to come from 

a microscopic properties of super conductors his avant and innovation that it means that magnetic field manipulators

 

super conductor 

then it's 

two 

superconducting body only 

on the soda length scale which is called long and innovation types 

which is of course measure of super fruit density 

then the next 

a a 

milestone in there 

the research of super can that into us v. 

discovery a non discovered about 

construction condemning logical theory of a a 

his book and landau 

ah 

oh 

i mean 

among researchers that is different opinions 

but for example 

i just the incan quarts of

 

a mile from these new 

cool gave a talk in about twenty years ago 

in the estimate he said that 

begins work on those your reason 

one of them 

great a theory of two inches century 

personally i share this opinion 

because i like it 

now you antagonists always saying that it is just a little expunged 

you to do a lot of functions 

so um 

this story also took from market in a minute 

a cool was actually a italy 

his work was his a. p. z. adviser 

and 

a keen 

told the story how or 

his book arrive so 

these discoveries 

he actually wanted to he was very impressed by along those who have succumbed to the first incision 

and he wanted to go 

applied this unit to a 

two proofreading 

it was discovered in thirty eight 

and then 

killing assault what these are all of the planet 

because they origin use it superficially densities it's a that some other planet that's what appears below t. c. 

um the point 

but yeah 

the problem was a super fluid density can lobby on all the time because it is all of this

 

taylor and it should be 

in square and landau theory 

it cannot be mean you suck killed a soccer ball square don't of 

super through density 

but scribbled his cellphone looks very good 

and of course can use of quantum mechanics of density is a square observe function 

and this is a view he came to one now 

and that's how was a piece a tuna 

or static 

so i mean it was a lot of um 

details 

a vote is a a theory i just fill you only one 

as you i mean in contemporary formulation can all because of this is the challenge

 

because all the planet is coupled to electromagnetic field 

and that's where the quantum mechanics a scum 

this is a series pure quantum mechanical because 

you cannot avoid each in serie age bar 

he's come in 

either you can write it like feel like you're right here or you can you can look avoided that should be in the flux plant

 

but spun age bar 

it's quantum 

so 

well jeez chad 

of course 

they sort is 

eat or not eat 

and and also an argument 

argument was even ice use of the book eat 

it means that i just us you'll that it might be spatial dependent 

but spatial dependence breaks 

engage advances this equation 

therefore it should be easy 

so zeroth east i'm in their head 

a a 

publications but i couldn't find in the library 

when a group of just couldn't find the original paper 

for some reason 

ah 

this 

issue is absent from our 

everything 

i'm in 

and zeros a um 

it should be in 

he started but we don't have any reason to believe that it is different from eat 

in reality of course after this period of his parents own 

you know that it is to eat 

and in a moment of course if you look at the second his work on the question of is the same as a little aggression if you forget about 

this part of karma 

we just called our magnetic but 

currently only user them admit it can 

if if long immigration

 

yes we have two members of her current is equal to a 

the control of them 

each 

the next point 

also very interesting 

user 

discovery of practice of competitive bidding 

this is a 

actually during his stay in a light and labor 

yeah nick of 

orgy 

publisher papers as there are two different 

type of super conductors 

magnetic 

a a moment of them is 

strongly depends on the twenty two pistol you different 

of course 

he couldn't throw a 

class make a classification classification schemes king later 

but 

in gives one thousand is another

 

length scale which is exciting and that is it 

you mentioned this parameter 

each is a ratio of these two length scale 

he just called er 

he's worked on the planet 

can be more some plot of uh squares of two 

therefore all the potential for the course of 

cool 

and see that such a situation loss 

came to criticise 

and 

and at least as it is and it can endear because a phone number press nature 

he 

become seek and her 

when still close but until now decided to visit him 

at one point he notices

 

ian 

table to table it was an old book of records of were it was long and the question is a functional inside 

so it is 

colored equation for a vortex 

he said for him okay 

yeah seek now but when they become 

i 

the you know whether we talk about it and i'm appeared the paper of fine mum 

where he discuss 

forty she's in a 

he could he do 

then undoubtedly in 

his father 

gorgon's it 

that skull 

because of 

seoul 

you'd gone don't creation and sending it to fly chapter 

and houses theory of the second a second that to superconducting it is yes 

so what is important that if you apply magnetic field 

the type two super conductors 

they cannot rates

 

cool 

bulk 

as a 

single cortices it's like cubism magnetic field 

hall some 

how 

next step was a 

this girl i'm in the creation of their 

another 

tina of thing to century is this your theory which 

of good number price 

fifteen years later on 

these three yeah 

but could potentially fifth 

and ever since started throwing game own little bit mean problem 

who just can see the two electrons feature more going on there 

jeremy surface justin's of mixed up objects move in in the presence of the embassy and

 

in each case and a fraction that ins and uncontrolled immediately because motion on the surface these two dimensional 

every potential says a collective potentials has a level so he made it clear 

a follow the 

the v. a. 

he is a bone state 

a a 

essentially period to period this year searing reach 

i mean 

okay it's he's a 

so it's um 

or the parameter of each she's or a proportional to he's got 

and the spectrum become got 

spectrum of based on do victims was going to be very near mover 

he's a he's a frame of a of the current 

ah i don't care for women to take sufficient suspended just that should never crosses era 

so is it's not the case for the duvet super conductor 

in so doing super conductor if i have to use of the information a 

a two they're moving frame 

i always he ever 

z. it negative branches of spectrum 

and because it is a question way 

and you re superconducting super conduct 

so i'm in this series 

regional known communities published in there 

thirty pages of the physical to the physical or you be

 

i mean 

because i don't know 

thousands of citations 

thousands 

not thousands 

many thousands 

so basically i'm in a main point of this series of these are 

not proper bound state of 

will entrance 

the reason for that are under which makes spit ducked 

and 

second 

point is that if i apply 

extends all 

field or 

i 

the current flow of his observation because of long okay 

of course a 

it was 

theory 

when you will develop medicating the ten years after discovered of super can the kennedy said the 

all possible 

gration switch we use in how like available vision equations 

uh get go for creations the

 

gaza classical equations schools of then and the alien bed agree everything was done 

and the 

sharm and reddish of discussions was and seventies and eighties as far as a high temperature superconducting that is cancer 

so the time 

i already remember myself 

of the time 

high temperature super conductors was a fifteen super combated 

the compounds super conductor 

snail room 

he 

the team or something like that is a critical temperature boast twenty kelvin 

they considered to be of any yeah 

these high probability of publication in a a a technological applications let's see 

and for example of what we did said that family rollers investigate how of be 

there's this type of super conductors are sensitive tool for example extend or a deviation 

because when you more with two bucks in the radar or whatever 

there is there 

certain type of addition and it might damage superconducting like a fifteen compounded

 

in gives it is quite a shot 

because of critical temperature because of this it 

and 

some somebody can say is that it is disaster somebody since the great discovered it 

if you can 

and of a to swim and 

you're not and alex miller discotheque and which super conductors 

as a bank 

now i'm in a 

ah 

ah 

it was really 

i'm in 

very essential amount 

because everyone sort certificate super conductor sir buffer big nitrogen point 

it will be widely used 

or in a day 

at home 

what was section in north 

so simple 

i'm am i here for

 

combing all 

so it will be thirty years of the discovery of but it's still not letting 

ah 

many 

device 

that you hear 

the market 

so 

in chile for example in our department was a group or which was working on there 

ah 

but i soon by real mum lead oxides 

which is 

for money 

belongs to the same class of materials 

and one just a portal for a a 

the norton near appeared 

this was very quickly synthesized an hour of work to do so 

our laborers who was almost the first of the soviet union which have there 

high temperature superconducting 

picture that's a sort of 

you know him or her 

now let me 

come do 

what they're doing 

in our luck

 

first of all i would say that if we divide 

all the scientific community 

yeah 

which i work in in 

the field of supercomputing two parts of the first part isn't let's say 

people who are not interested mechanism should and that it is us in law on a mechanism is something which you never can determine 

there is so little of experiments which we can design 

a and do what means for months or more formal schooling too good to super convicted of can be determined experimentally 

difficult 

there is no all yes and no extensions of field so let us not to do innocent 

and high temperature super conductors for me is nothing else than super conductor were the by temperature is not 

so different from critical temperatures there's only different 

that's yeah i could such an opinion 

another the growth by far the biggest 

on their center not now 

even if it is very difficult but we still would like to fish 

in there 

you know in 

yeah 

so 

a fun of the community reach is a um a 

and let's see also 

quite well known isn't a 

it's not necessarily form based 

it's born wasn't based so it means of 

the binoculars because of exchange of balls on 

in this era of course was so steep can buy it at a very 

in 

sixties 

and ah 

it's 

three to four forms

 

so my in a in grad insulza scenery are a 

quite simple so 

he permits rises v. 

relations 

so apostles two electrodes in terms of coolant of the potential 

all of the super conductor sir the time was just the medals of course is a light shade of the surface 

so 

launches a potential assume to be not big enough 

to cause instability just seventeen 

and 

it was a interesting moments in this era of the earth 

well as far as that is concerned 

cool that have also is a

 

stone had used 

because of litigation 

so it means a little informal long call is created 

the second to lift them as secure far away from that one saw that means that it is additional 

a range even or 

think insidious so 

these are 

cool to the potential is used 

two new star 

and new star 

thistle that if miz usually cold though 

but different the people who went of his book 

where often with this called the moral and other celebrities who but the national edition that's called do much of anything because 

it was a chilling 

he is before moral and under some paperwork he invented 

this is from the luo school i didn't mention anything about work of a global from that is run in this is a separate subject

 

so 

that is a problem of the seat of course when you want to check here in experimental looked if independent 

estimates of different planet us uh from different experiments 

these guys this time 

he is only ins a superconducting eighty series 

so that means that if a right he is equal 

some function of failing to phone coupling constant than a star 

it means that i i say nothing 

i can get it right 

i could not missus mister 

so usually people use sun analogy let's take from certain assumes that it is the same for another and

 

it's 

some 

some business lines 

in other 

quantity of each comes to series of circles and function 

each planet eyes in a telephone suction 

so as you know electrons and former model in that is a internet to want to each other 

so he introduced such a spectral function 

which characterises 

upon production this is a very complicated functions 

it depends on energy on follow nuisance ensemble there is a substantial simplification 

because 

all this electronic images of a semi and manages election middle 

therefore you can ah 

cold 

just 

this function 

sigh equal to manage 

if you counted from can manage evening as zero 

and as a result i rise to his state of functioning member function 

now of course it's a question is how to deal was that i mean 

this function is used in principle measurable 

if i see if elastic newton scandinavia can measure 

every form online of its if i can separate 

in elastic land it's from there 

a line is in use by his other i measure that they have to integrate to do a whole reruns of

 

a lot of work non has done it before the and i don't think that somebody can do it 

and 

but of course moments of dysfunction the first mormon 

you don't want let's say it's called 

a couple in constant 

that's what you want to measure 

so to summarise 

these theory 

introduces 

spectral function of a little form interaction or any other interaction 

should adjust frequency dependent it's a bit out of this 

and second 

there is a call to the potential which is used you do

 

ovation 

so 

ah 

what is it 

essential invasion theory is that 

if i 

so all the creation 

i will immediately realise that 

there is not a constant it's a function of frequency 

it means of eve i do for example 

a optical connectivity measurement or a more a 

finally they turn 

do certainty that if my candles to do six i can see circles crouching in there 

and a lot of 

people were involved in such a spectroscopy solely sees a peak cinnamon candles physics usually do second derivative

 

they compared to some mute invader 

okay i season a fourteen electron volts peak in very 

a high temperature superconducting that means that it is magnetic 

interactions 

that's a typical a 

lets me 

statement of 

some papers 

and that 

in our lab success another technique 

each 

a uses air be um 

and ah 

or a short 

laser pulses 

you excite a little hole there and you can monitor calls it looks issue a car 

when you know monitors and what's issue 

accession ease nothing nails and annexation into a family could you discuss normal state i discuss on the normal state 

so you can determine what station time 

you still exhibition times they are dependent on their interaction and the system therefore 

why 

you know certain analysis of kinetic equations you can judge about certain moments of the air

 

yeah but function in in general they can measure a 

now a kosher the potential 

never done much in principle yes if you can is all that if you conceive 

it is in principle possible 

now what shall 

the 

this stuff which was a 

none in our love and 

mostly way east of 

now that my and the 

it was a sham 

measurements was not 

in a of milan also 

a partial partially in our work 

so 

just measured enough electrician time if you're lucky you can determine a identifies a process that yes it is an informed electrician 

how you do it 

customers the temperature dependence you have to measure intensity dependence of relaxation time and use as a moral a similar visit look puny predicts you can as humans they are 

and that's a result that's for high temperature superconducting 

now it is but one 

also a 

ah i took the data from a a in other paper which is none for me thanks 

and for me that's for example number are 

her 

substantially lower 

and the 

ah actually you measure not now he was the second one 

of the 

yeah function 

so 

now i'm almost 

than rigid of 

discuss the last point of 

my talk is a superconducting eighty is repulsive from production

 

so after we see if it was 

published 

in other 

he's used 

who would have a price for his density functional theory a 

well one 

his letters or who's 

famous 

newsroom 

because of like digitally could 

ah 

a very 

came to the physical position 

the eve 

you can see that 

the pasta from production 

which is 

that's a short range 

we can care for 

supercomputing superconducting 

or the 

ah 

just 

kevin section repulsion 

and the reason is very simple 

because 

not only have repulsion second diagrams you have a exchange 

in that case 

and exchange links 

a spatial dependence of these 

a interaction 

in sum channels in some 

ah this 

finally momentum 

you can have 

action 

and the of course estimates was not very promising because sir estimates of the critical temperature don't just as a basis of family unit 

and you could not in 

in it except charge of electronics and then i 

there 

jeremy energy stew parameters 

old nothing else 

you can so you can pretty well estimate critical temperature and it appears to be extended to minus seven govern 

but 

then 

they my very careful or a statement that in the real system when the film was surfaces not static now 

and so on and so on you my you might see them constantly subject 

this paper was 

ah 

what 

i mean it was a normal

 

nobody pays much attention 

ah so 

probably some people use this is also in the super three did you feel pity because it's also played in but 

some people believe that this mechanism is applicable to this ah 

a super freedom 

so what can i say 

a about material of angular momentum super connectivity is usually does all the parameter is a function of to coordinate if elected 

you can write it in terms of central must coordinate in the 

that relative coordinate 

so since you're searching for their uniform solution

 

about his sense of must you've 

and 

i don't care 

he's a didn't dependence on the relative government and as a function of this relative 

growing up like an cabbage anapum you can care 

a you know 

oh pierces different orbital london 

so formally if i yeah right 

the the theory i mean known that the typical in which i don't 

i mean adequation for 

these years got it's just disintegration 

it's just a little into a little bit complicated form 

including discoverable

 

this can analyze us some off 

irreducible diagrams that means of items which i cannot cut my line just close in 

but just question too feminine lines 

ah 

and 

to investigate superconducting detective to so very simple equation for of i can but it's 

these and many challenges secretion of just i can run a switch antennas a cup and customs 

so i'm you can see that if i assume that my apostle is just for a 

momentum independent 

these teabag dems cancelled so i live only has one in prison in other 

and this second bag as a lot of academics change that and gives me a super connectivity 

so off 

stick to speak and if i can see the harbor model 

t. d. it is super conductor 

so on in the calculations are pretty simple 

because simon income function is long and you have to just calculated 

one infinite own 

it is done 

what isn't 

interesting is that if i assume that i'm in my interaction is the north 

you are you know point like

 

he's a screen you can the system 

so 

ah and i calculate 

when you have found that i'll hit 

regional wins 

a three dimensional keys 

result any encore single arts and so on so 

ah 

the second point which i want to say is that if i can see the two dimensional keys 

the dimensional case is not superconducting 

because 

uh now to function in two d. is like that 

if i calculate all a 

a expansion to the 

but in a mouse 

ah 

so i'll sousa only positive lambert be a slaughter action 

everything is repulsive 

but 

also 

the group 

which are studying the same in in this disney just one in late doesn't mean

 

it's hereby honor from much incurred um 

and two because 

as a 

mention that eve 

you take into account that spectrum is a trillion pistol is a little bit different 

then 

just a square or um in this place 

you may fifth superconducting because it is because of because editor thelma surface 

because you or everything you need to leverage over the surface and shape of the concert just use 

yeah important 

they are 

succumbed to sit revival of this unit was 

you have to 

these big s. from california 

they 

deep very expensive calculations using them 

a two dimensional model 

and they are 

they managed to do 

accurately evaluate use dragon dance and 

they claim that 

when 

number reflectance increases to art stuff in 

the d. v. other parameter start being such a model 

they said that you know 

this phase diagram a high temperature superconducting 

means of this is an 

it was still 

discuss 

by the way of the sides of the super connectivity disappears in a small no pink little it means of 

the electrons are almost three and exact make 

two dimensional a 

a link a function doesn't have negative a 

components invent 

a mission to bring them expunged 

what was strange and his paper and of course we of course in our paper me 

what it is 

that 

ah 

they say isn't eve 

you can see that 

them 

um 

mortal 

legs it 

in the in a 

not model exhibit for the met mental two dimensional middle 

which is characterised by being the sights every does and dignitas ice reduces nothing of the nature of worried used to

 

of 

tool or vice versa distance between elected and so ah 

divided to reduce 

if distance between the latencies small 

are small as unwarranted side of her a iteration theory i can emission exponent on the small i. s. 

so 

as human vet 

coulomb interactions in such a case ease of 

its beak and well screen 

this of course 

incorrect 

i mean what is that 

and the 

what that then then paper was published i mean it is clear why because he for your right as an aggression for is going in a as you can see that the small planets s.

 

so that means that a a 

use in your skin in a just as much lives in a like a if it means that the 

you can not risking encourages which is olives those a distant within the net 

because of this 

but 

i mean in 

discussion which was about just paper later on a 

these seeds fall in mail 

which i like very much because it can prove my knowledge of english 

ah 

ah 

three 

this fall than that 

v. 

introduce you mean what is it in a 

ah 

the sentence contains very carefully inserted modify army avon didn't walls of dismay is a modified 

so it means that 

yeah 

it is something you could not establish but i mean yeah it is difficult to a stable because it is 

incorrect 

it 

it's so 

also very interesting have submitted this paper 

in twenty seventh of january last year 

and that was published in 

thirty first of march 

physically workers to month 

medically 

and usually peak 

so what we actually did his a full and let us 

can see there 

be 

interaction 

which is screened coulomb interactions

 

and let us assume 

for some reason these some major articles which um 

it's possible for screenings there's been so well as an electrons 

and they're like tool like ghost particles 

so 

so 

this in your screen images is the biggest planet 

steele 

there is a 

dependence in 

and if you expand this potential in survey like one or a square one or a couple square 

this is just a little isaac sponsored monarch up a horse 

this is the same smallest exchange bank them

 

so that means of this jong il can beat his exchanged a 

so immediate results was very 

i'm in very interesting you can become coalitions to conclude women 

two lines 

just as a you know 

no lives on the normal to is in the middle of course wilson to some songs on 

you can see that 

p. they've super convicted 

he is when an s. is more than thirty six so it is part of the time they're a big mcchrystal point

 

a delay 

because d. v. a. the aid it 

not induce a dorm you have to go further 

could you do for is responsible for nearly 

and that 

you may 

last may be very tiny 

a teenager speeches and physical 

so it means that it is very probable that 

ah 

no moral lesson realistic 

a type of infection you need to strong suppression of a super convict duty invent channels is low low orbital moments

 

so what i want to say is that 

really manage this certain um 

actually it is very difficult to evaluate all these items when you're in that actually is codependent 

extremely 

difficult because 

also my tickets are important in a very unique if we do it but 

i'm in a certain mood 

ah 

the whole to see peaks 

you can manage 

to do it and 

the result is 

here 

this is a much more flounder

 

and this is there 

in each channel this is the angular momentum teach you have much more flounder 

and here you are an s. which is divided the seeks it means of here and this is agent 

so u. k. f. 

yeah 

s. wave superconducting eighteen is a critical temperature reaches the you know 

the exponent in in the hut in confidence 

but 

minus and and and 

ah 

ah but 

i mean you have 

do we have so work 

i wanna say from that 

i mean if you're 

underlies 

such a banking like supercomputing 

superconducting channels 

i mean you have to be really really careful when you choose 

interaction 

sometimes 

to convict duties dependent on channels which you know you may just you click 

and it is dangerous 

thank you for attention 

i 

thank you 

many questions 

did you want to do is look you don't want to kill any just so does was confused but 

uses only disprove would be stolen some hold good middle 

you have only met online that's so some hole 

you should not attributable to see online substantially switch me cuomo's that's what do you use dimensional a electron gas

 

two dimensional electron gas in the presence of latest 

it means that frozen collate its 

he's a bigger alt potential each creates our band spit film 

actually i didn't mention this in the in his presentation the in the paper it is a it is published but this is of course just two dimensional it's impossible 

this is alaska 

if you sold six 

that move 

is there any way to approach this married 

the second part of your your

 

well as a second or third quarter of your lecture to law school too 

the phone 

and 

coulomb interactions 

probably possible i'm in the in a a a 

interaction is alleged this is a crowded 

you have to take it out ovation idiots 

a introduction of 

for a repulsion is not at a to b. f. 

i'm in 

i don't know either i don't know i'm in the funds if you can have super connectivity in journal of isn't going to be real 

angular momentum this once it is a known fact than in but the 

um 

it was a very instructive mature 

the story both holes best 

both host 

ah yes 

that's one big no no on whenever i speak of super convicted you 

just make sure that coming on this is not the only person 

but i mean it was quite a few people who you mentioned cameroon gonna sometime in 

also of organs a lot was done actually in one of the slide it was a guy who was a 

ah 

responsible for all equipment and so on and so on
