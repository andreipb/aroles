VL-kolkabsu 4.71 7.00 s0001 SOMETHING INVOLVED 
VL-kolkabsu 7.00 8.75 s0001 MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT 
VL-kolkabsu 8.75 10.36 s0001 AND 
VL-kolkabsu 10.36 12.53 s0001 MICHAEL YOU'LL ENJOY 
VL-kolkabsu 12.53 14.10 s0001 A LITTLE BIT 
VL-kolkabsu 14.38 16.15 s0001 AT LEAST JUST PART 
VL-kolkabsu 16.48 17.88 s0001 SO AH 
VL-kolkabsu 17.88 19.74 s0001 MY INTEREST SO 
VL-kolkabsu 19.74 21.60 s0001 FOR CONVICT ELITIST ANSWER 
VL-kolkabsu 21.60 24.14 s0001 WHEN I WAS GRADUATE STUDENT THE 
VL-kolkabsu 24.14 25.49 s0001 STUDENT 
VL-kolkabsu 25.49 27.18 s0001 THE COHERENT 
VL-kolkabsu 27.18 32.07 s0001 IN RUSSIA'S A SYSTEM FOR EDUCATION IS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF SEVERE YOU COULD CHOOSE 
VL-kolkabsu 32.68 35.91 s0001 SUBJECT MODERN HAVE SUBJECT ISSUE OF 
VL-kolkabsu 35.91 37.43 s0001 SPECIALISED AND 
VL-kolkabsu 37.43 39.96 s0001 OUR TEACHER IN QUANTUM MECHANICS 
VL-kolkabsu 40.32 41.78 s0001 OTHERWISE ME 
VL-kolkabsu 41.78 43.43 s0001 TO TRY SUPER CAN THAT EAT 
VL-kolkabsu 43.43 44.76 s0001 THE TIME 
VL-kolkabsu 44.76 47.28 s0001 AND BUTTON TOES FORM 
VL-kolkabsu 47.28 50.86 s0001 ESTABLISHED TO THESE UNIVERSITIES PROBABLY IS ONLY ONE 
VL-kolkabsu 50.86 53.89 s0001 IN THE WORLD DEPARTMENT OF SUPERCONDUCTING EIGHTEEN 
VL-kolkabsu 53.89 55.26 s0001 WELL 
VL-kolkabsu 55.26 59.11 s0001 THE MAIN PURPOSE WAS TO 
VL-kolkabsu 59.90 61.47 s0001 EDUCATE 
VL-kolkabsu 61.47 64.27 s0001 SUFFICIENT EASTERN SUPERCONDUCTING TO BECAUSE 
VL-kolkabsu 64.27 65.93 s0001 AT THE TIME OR ENERGY 
VL-kolkabsu 65.93 68.49 s0001 HE SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS 
VL-kolkabsu 69.63 71.99 s0001 THEY WANT TO USE IT FOR 
VL-kolkabsu 71.99 74.25 s0001 IN DIFFERENT AREAS LIKE I DUNNO 
VL-kolkabsu 74.25 75.88 s0001 ACCELERATORS 
VL-kolkabsu 75.88 78.24 s0001 AND THE SUSPICION BEFORE 
VL-kolkabsu 78.24 80.22 s0001 FUSION BOOKMARKS 
VL-kolkabsu 80.22 86.85 s0001 AND THE BASE FOR OR OR STUDIES OF SUPERCONDUCTING TO BASE HIS DIGITAL SWITCH OF INSTITUTE 
VL-kolkabsu 87.75 93.51 s0001 SO THAT'S HOW I BECOME AWARE OF BOTH SUPERCONDUCTING IT IS OF COURSE SAYING YOU A LITTLE BIT BEFORE BUT 
VL-kolkabsu 93.51 94.74 s0001 THAT'S 
VL-kolkabsu 94.74 95.83 s0001 OKAY 
VL-kolkabsu 95.83 97.13 s0001 SONG 
VL-kolkabsu 97.13 98.80 s0001 MY TALK WILL BE 
VL-kolkabsu 98.80 100.13 s0001 MOSTLY 
VL-kolkabsu 100.13 102.88 s0001 HISTORICAL OVERVIEW AND THEM 
VL-kolkabsu 102.88 105.99 s0001 I'M STILL A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR DEPARTMENT 
VL-kolkabsu 107.97 109.41 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 109.41 111.09 s0001 AS YOU KNOW YOU'RE WRONG 
VL-kolkabsu 111.09 117.24 s0001 LAST YEAR IT WAS KIND OF INDIA'S OF IT EARLIER SCENARIO OF SCHOLARS WHO CAN THAT IT 
VL-kolkabsu 117.24 120.83 s0001 WHICH WAS DONE BY CAMERON COME ON THIS IN 
VL-kolkabsu 120.83 122.40 s0001 A LION 
VL-kolkabsu 122.40 126.73 s0001 A LABOR OF LIGHT LIGHT IN A UNIVERSITY 
VL-kolkabsu 126.73 128.06 s0001 IN A 
VL-kolkabsu 128.06 129.81 s0001 A NEVERLAND 
VL-kolkabsu 129.81 131.42 s0001 AND THE 
VL-kolkabsu 131.42 136.07 s0001 OF COURSE BEFORE DISCOVERED SUPER CONNECTIVITY HE TOAST 
VL-kolkabsu 136.07 137.95 s0001 OR A BIG IF I 
VL-kolkabsu 137.95 139.64 s0001 LINCOLN P. ROOM 
VL-kolkabsu 139.64 141.38 s0001 IN 
VL-kolkabsu 141.51 143.21 s0001 NINETEEN OH EIGHT 
VL-kolkabsu 143.21 144.78 s0001 SO THAT MEANS OF 
VL-kolkabsu 144.78 148.81 s0001 WELL LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS AS IT IS IT STUFF THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 149.46 151.44 s0001 THREE YEARS BEFORE 
VL-kolkabsu 152.85 157.04 s0001 PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SOMETHING IN PART FULL TEMPERATURE PHYSICS IS 
VL-kolkabsu 157.04 158.74 s0001 SUPER CONNECTIVITY 
VL-kolkabsu 158.76 161.38 s0001 SO MANY KICK LEFT OF DISCOVERY OF 
VL-kolkabsu 161.38 163.66 s0001 A SUPER CONNECTIVITY HE 
VL-kolkabsu 163.66 165.15 s0001 GOT MOMENT PRICE 
VL-kolkabsu 165.15 168.07 s0001 IT WAS THE FIRST MOMENT BRYSON SUPER CAN THE COMMUNITY 
VL-kolkabsu 168.07 169.34 s0001 IN TOTAL 
VL-kolkabsu 169.34 175.62 s0001 A FEW SUPER CONNECTIVITY IT WELL LET'S SAY SUPER CONVICT IN AGAIN AND SUPER FREED 
VL-kolkabsu 175.62 177.64 s0001 IT WAS AWARDED 
VL-kolkabsu 177.64 179.22 s0001 SEVEN OF THE PRICES 
VL-kolkabsu 179.22 183.72 s0001 FIVE IN SUPER CONNECTIVITY AND FIRE THE TWO IN 
VL-kolkabsu 183.72 185.89 s0001 THE FIELD OF SUPER FRUIT EATING 
VL-kolkabsu 186.16 187.61 s0001 AND THE 
VL-kolkabsu 187.61 188.66 s0001 THE LOST 
VL-kolkabsu 188.66 189.75 s0001 SIX OF THEM 
VL-kolkabsu 189.75 193.24 s0001 OF COURSE THE WATER TINS THE LAST FORTY YEARS 
VL-kolkabsu 193.24 197.41 s0001 SO STARTING FROM B. C. S. WHICH WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED TO WHOM 
VL-kolkabsu 197.41 199.15 s0001 JOSEPH'S OWN 
VL-kolkabsu 199.15 201.19 s0001 BRIAN JONES OF SOME VALIDITY IN 
VL-kolkabsu 201.19 202.93 s0001 SO IN TWO THREE AND THEM 
VL-kolkabsu 202.93 204.10 s0001 IT'S UM 
VL-kolkabsu 204.10 206.74 s0001 FIRST DISCOVERED OF SUPER MEDIUM 
VL-kolkabsu 207.01 208.44 s0001 AND 
VL-kolkabsu 208.44 210.64 s0001 I'LL KILL LATER 
VL-kolkabsu 210.64 212.06 s0001 ABOUT THIS 
VL-kolkabsu 212.06 214.32 s0001 SO TRUE 
VL-kolkabsu 214.39 216.42 s0001 THE 
VL-kolkabsu 221.20 223.62 s0001 YOU ALREADY INTEREST TO 
VL-kolkabsu 223.62 226.52 s0001 COX WORLD SCHOLARSHIP IN THAT PERIOD 
VL-kolkabsu 226.52 229.41 s0001 AND THEN WHEN YOU READ ABOUT IT AND FROM EUROPE 
VL-kolkabsu 229.41 233.34 s0001 LOOK WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS THEY SAID TO SOLVE THE PLAN 
VL-kolkabsu 233.34 236.18 s0001 IT'S MEAN REALLY 
VL-kolkabsu 236.18 237.89 s0001 MOM VIDEO BECAUSE 
VL-kolkabsu 237.89 240.15 s0001 FIRST OF ALL IT WAS NO HELIUM 
VL-kolkabsu 240.35 241.75 s0001 FOUR 
VL-kolkabsu 241.75 245.82 s0001 THESE SMALL OF WORK AS A GIFT TO GET SOMEWHERE HERE YOU'LL 
VL-kolkabsu 246.84 251.35 s0001 IF YOU LOOK OZ A BOOK YOU GUESSED HE DOING IT 
VL-kolkabsu 251.35 253.35 s0001 IT'S A NEW 
VL-kolkabsu 253.35 255.67 s0001 VERY INTERESTING STARTED BECAUSE A 
VL-kolkabsu 255.67 259.85 s0001 FIRST OF ALL TO TRY TO GET HELIUM FROM STONES FROM ICELAND 
VL-kolkabsu 259.85 261.88 s0001 JUST BREAK STONES 
VL-kolkabsu 261.88 264.16 s0001 AND TRY TO COLLECT ENOUGH OF HELIUM 
VL-kolkabsu 264.16 266.34 s0001 NO WAY IT DIDN'T WORK 
VL-kolkabsu 266.34 268.11 s0001 SO THEY COLLECTED 
VL-kolkabsu 268.11 271.56 s0001 THICK AND THIN SIXTY NEED HELIUM GAS 
VL-kolkabsu 271.56 273.72 s0001 ONLY AFTER A 
VL-kolkabsu 273.72 274.87 s0001 THE 
VL-kolkabsu 274.87 276.36 s0001 THE 
VL-kolkabsu 276.36 281.80 s0001 IT'S SOME ADDITIONAL SALES FROM NORSE CAROLINA ARRIVED 
VL-kolkabsu 281.80 288.43 s0001 AND YOU CAN DIMENSIONS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ACRES OF HUMANS ARE JUST JUST HAVE 
VL-kolkabsu 288.43 296.68 s0001 AND AH FOR MANY YEARS SLIDE RULE THE WORLD WAS JUST ONE LEVEL THAT IMAGE HAD LEAGUE Q. THEREFORE FOR EXAMPLE 
VL-kolkabsu 296.68 298.84 s0001 IN THE FIRST TWENTY YEARS 
VL-kolkabsu 298.84 305.48 s0001 I MEAN VAST MAJORITY OF PUBLICATIONS OF FLOW ALL ON THE SUBJECT AFLOAT AND WHICH IS JUST COME FROM HIS WALLET 
VL-kolkabsu 305.48 313.60 s0001 THAT'S THE REASON WHY MOST DISCOVERED THIS IN THIS FIELD INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE LIKE A QUANTUM OSCILLATIONS BUT IT'S JUST 
VL-kolkabsu 313.60 315.31 s0001 EVERYTHING FROM HERE 
VL-kolkabsu 316.18 318.70 s0001 AND A FAN 
VL-kolkabsu 318.70 327.80 s0001 THE MAIN PROBLEM WHICH THE MOST SINCE THE FEEL THE SUPER IN DO SO LET'S SEE SORT OF STATE PHYSICS OR LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS FLAWS 
VL-kolkabsu 327.80 328.92 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 328.92 332.39 s0001 A HOUSE IS DUE TO BE HERE IN THAT LOW TEMPERATURE 
VL-kolkabsu 332.39 333.74 s0001 WHAT IS IT 
VL-kolkabsu 333.74 335.97 s0001 START TO ROLL START TO 
VL-kolkabsu 335.97 337.27 s0001 DRAW OR 
VL-kolkabsu 337.27 338.83 s0001 MEAN CONSTANT 
VL-kolkabsu 338.83 346.51 s0001 THEREFORE THE FIRST TYPE OF MEASUREMENT THEY DECIDED TO GOOD USE AS A MEASUREMENTS OF WAS DELETED FROM A SIMPLE MEASUREMENTS OF COURSE 
VL-kolkabsu 346.51 348.15 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 348.15 352.46 s0001 CAN LINK ONCE KEPT HIS OWN AGENDA THERE WOULD SAY HE 
VL-kolkabsu 352.68 355.40 s0001 HAVE A IDEAS 
VL-kolkabsu 355.40 358.24 s0001 AND HE'S SORT OF EACH HEAP UNIFY 
VL-kolkabsu 358.24 359.71 s0001 WELL MATERIALS 
VL-kolkabsu 359.71 361.67 s0001 THEY BECOME SUPERCONDUCTING 
VL-kolkabsu 361.67 365.09 s0001 THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU START THIS PLATINUM GOLD 
VL-kolkabsu 366.55 371.00 s0001 HE DID MEASUREMENTS NO SUPERCOMPUTING NOTHING WAS FOUNDED JUST 
VL-kolkabsu 371.00 375.96 s0001 THE SUPER TO THE A. IS DUE TO DOING A LITTLE CONSTANT 
VL-kolkabsu 375.96 378.47 s0001 THEY DECIDED TO 
VL-kolkabsu 378.47 380.49 s0001 THE MEASUREMENTS ONLY OKAY 
VL-kolkabsu 380.49 382.44 s0001 THAT'S VERY LARGE DECISION 
VL-kolkabsu 382.44 386.39 s0001 BUT THE ARGUMENTS WISELY CHOOSE MEDICAL UNIVERSE 
VL-kolkabsu 386.39 389.81 s0001 REGIONAL JAIL BECAUSE IT WAS VERY EASY TO BEAUTIFUL RIGHT 
VL-kolkabsu 390.50 392.96 s0001 MUCH MORE REASON SOME OTHER 
VL-kolkabsu 392.96 394.51 s0001 MATERIALS 
VL-kolkabsu 394.57 396.11 s0001 SO LIKE WAS 
VL-kolkabsu 396.11 397.63 s0001 BECAUSE 
VL-kolkabsu 397.82 405.27 s0001 YOU KNOW NOVELS OF CRITICAL TEMPERATURE FOR AMERICA IS VERY CLOSE TO WOMAN PARENTAL FOR OF LAW 
VL-kolkabsu 405.27 406.81 s0001 HE DO SO 
VL-kolkabsu 406.81 411.35 s0001 IT COULD GO TEMPERATURE MADE TREES ABOUT A FOUR POINT FIFTEEN KELLEN 
VL-kolkabsu 411.35 417.01 s0001 AND FOR BONE AND POINT IS A WORLD THOUGH ISSUES ABOUT FOUR POINT TWO 
VL-kolkabsu 418.44 419.84 s0001 SO UM 
VL-kolkabsu 419.84 421.55 s0001 THEY DID JUST MEASUREMENTS 
VL-kolkabsu 421.55 423.84 s0001 AND TO ME BECAUSE I FOUND THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 423.84 424.89 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 424.89 426.47 s0001 HIS DUTIES YOU KNOW 
VL-kolkabsu 426.47 432.80 s0001 NO WAY IT IS A SHORT CIRCUIT IN THOSE IN OUR SO KRAUSE TOUGHER 
VL-kolkabsu 432.80 436.90 s0001 HAS ANYBODY COULD REPEATEDLY PLEADED MEASUREMENTS MANY MANY PANTS 
VL-kolkabsu 436.90 438.28 s0001 BUT 
VL-kolkabsu 438.28 440.61 s0001 I MEAN DO 
VL-kolkabsu 440.84 446.07 s0001 A SAMPLES A USELESS IN SUCH A YOU SHOULD ADJUST POOR 
VL-kolkabsu 446.07 449.72 s0001 THEM AND CLEAN IT IT WAS TO APPLY TO LIVE SONS A MEASURE 
VL-kolkabsu 449.72 451.28 s0001 THIS IS DUE TO EXIT 
VL-kolkabsu 451.28 452.72 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 452.72 457.13 s0001 TO AVOID SURE SURE SURE CHECK IT WAS A 
VL-kolkabsu 457.13 460.35 s0001 CHANGE THE SHAPE OF THE SAMPLE SURVEY 
VL-kolkabsu 460.35 462.89 s0001 MADE IN THE DEVIL IN THE SHAPE 
VL-kolkabsu 462.89 464.64 s0001 BUT IT DIDN'T HELP 
VL-kolkabsu 464.64 467.67 s0001 THE MEASUREMENTS OREGON I SNEEZE A FULLER LATE 
VL-kolkabsu 467.67 470.75 s0001 THEY KEEP ALL THIS PRESSURE IN THE CREST OF 
VL-kolkabsu 470.75 472.85 s0001 BELOW ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE 
VL-kolkabsu 473.18 475.78 s0001 BECAUSE HE WAS EXPENSIVE 
VL-kolkabsu 476.48 478.26 s0001 SO AH 
VL-kolkabsu 478.26 487.24 s0001 AND OF COURSE THE INCOMING OXYGEN AND NITROGEN JUST POOR ALSO PAULSON'S A CRUST UP FILMS A CITIZEN RISE AGAIN WAS A HUGE ROOM 
VL-kolkabsu 487.47 488.95 s0001 BUT SINCE 
VL-kolkabsu 488.95 490.63 s0001 PRESSURE WAS LOW 
VL-kolkabsu 490.63 493.97 s0001 I WON'T GO INTO A WENT DOWN 
VL-kolkabsu 493.97 496.74 s0001 AND THE A BOMB 
VL-kolkabsu 497.40 502.75 s0001 AS IT IS ALSO ALL THIS MEASUREMENTS AMERICAN IT WAS ALWAYS 
VL-kolkabsu 502.75 506.54 s0001 UNDER CRITICAL TEMPERATURE SERVICES TO DOZIER 
VL-kolkabsu 507.97 509.55 s0001 JUST ACCIDENT 
VL-kolkabsu 509.55 511.03 s0001 FILLED THEM SO 
VL-kolkabsu 511.03 514.38 s0001 KIND OF A FINANCIAL SYSTEM 
VL-kolkabsu 514.38 520.77 s0001 ONCE DO THEY USE A U. STUDENT TO KEEP WHERE WERE A LOW PRESSURE VISITORS A SHOULD FURTHER 
VL-kolkabsu 520.77 526.00 s0001 FALL WE TOOK A LITTLE OF FOR SOME OIL IN SOME DEVICE 
VL-kolkabsu 526.00 531.55 s0001 AND FOR SOME REASON ONE STUDENT WAS NOT CAREFUL ENOUGH AND PER SE START TO GROW 
VL-kolkabsu 531.55 535.67 s0001 AND HE WAS INVITED ALONG COMES A CHILD 
VL-kolkabsu 535.67 539.75 s0001 BUT IT CAN ALSO MEASUREMENTS WAS DONE BY HOLES GILES HOST NOT 
VL-kolkabsu 539.75 542.88 s0001 THE MIDDLE AS BEING DOING MEASUREMENTS 
VL-kolkabsu 542.88 547.48 s0001 EVERY SINGLE NUMBERS IS HE WAS A SOURCE WHO MISSED SUPERCOMPUTING 
VL-kolkabsu 547.48 548.98 s0001 RESISTANCE 
VL-kolkabsu 549.09 552.15 s0001 HE WAS IN THE IN ROOM MADE LIVING ROOM 
VL-kolkabsu 552.22 556.22 s0001 AND STUDENT REPORTED SUPPRESSION OF MY 
VL-kolkabsu 556.22 560.80 s0001 IT SHOULDN'T WENT UP AND HE IMMEDIATELY SAW IT IN YEARS 
VL-kolkabsu 562.23 565.53 s0001 SO THAT'S HOW IT WAS 
VL-kolkabsu 565.53 566.82 s0001 DISCOVERED 
VL-kolkabsu 566.82 569.98 s0001 A WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 570.01 571.76 s0001 YEAH 
VL-kolkabsu 571.92 574.22 s0001 IN ALL PUBLICATIONS 
VL-kolkabsu 574.64 576.42 s0001 IT WAS ONLY ONE ALSO 
VL-kolkabsu 576.42 577.72 s0001 KIND OF INCONTINENCE 
VL-kolkabsu 577.72 579.65 s0001 NO MENTIONING OF 
VL-kolkabsu 579.83 581.31 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 581.31 585.38 s0001 I MEAN GREAT HE'S HE'S HE WAS A PHILIPS AFTERWARDS 
VL-kolkabsu 585.38 587.22 s0001 BUT NO ILL 
VL-kolkabsu 587.22 589.04 s0001 THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
VL-kolkabsu 589.39 591.28 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 591.28 593.12 s0001 AS A 
VL-kolkabsu 593.12 594.99 s0001 A ARCHIVING OF A NEWBORN 
VL-kolkabsu 594.99 599.64 s0001 USUALLY TWO HUNDRED LINES FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL CONCLUSION 
VL-kolkabsu 599.64 602.76 s0001 PHILOSOPHICAL CONCLUSION IS NOT ONLY EARTH 
VL-kolkabsu 602.76 605.41 s0001 AH THE THE 
VL-kolkabsu 605.41 611.89 s0001 NO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS AGO BUT ALSO SOME CHANGES IN THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 611.89 613.24 s0001 POOR SO FULL SESSION 
VL-kolkabsu 613.24 614.59 s0001 SOMETIMES NOW 
VL-kolkabsu 614.59 616.47 s0001 WHAT DOES A 
VL-kolkabsu 616.47 621.05 s0001 BECOME AWARE THAT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF SOME PAPER JUST AFTER PAPERS PUBLISHED 
VL-kolkabsu 621.05 625.80 s0001 ESPECIALLY AS A AS FAR AS THE SAMPLE GROSSES CONSOLED 
VL-kolkabsu 626.15 628.88 s0001 AND SOMETIMES A LIST OF PROJECT 
VL-kolkabsu 628.88 632.36 s0001 AND THEY'RE SAYING NO NO I HAVE NOTHING TO DO IS IS IF 
VL-kolkabsu 632.36 635.29 s0001 THAT'S CHRISTOPHER TOLD MISSUS EXAMPLE ONCE 
VL-kolkabsu 635.59 637.37 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 637.38 641.73 s0001 BUT IT'S NOT A DISCOVERY SUPERCONDUCTING EIGHTY IN MEDICAL 
VL-kolkabsu 641.73 644.83 s0001 IT WAS DISCOVERED IS DUE TO MING OTHER SAMPLES 
VL-kolkabsu 644.83 647.52 s0001 INCLUDING TEAM AND LEAD 
VL-kolkabsu 648.26 649.65 s0001 HMMM ALSO 
VL-kolkabsu 649.65 651.50 s0001 I SHOULD MENTION THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 651.62 655.67 s0001 THIS LEVEL THAT IT WAS VERY CLOSE TO DISCOVER FOR MYSELF 
VL-kolkabsu 655.67 657.44 s0001 MY STATE OF SOMETHING 
VL-kolkabsu 658.34 661.09 s0001 THEY AGAIN BECAUSE IT WAS VERY IT 
VL-kolkabsu 661.09 663.04 s0001 LITTLE OF HELIUM 
VL-kolkabsu 663.04 665.63 s0001 IT'S A DEEP MEASUREMENTS OLDER 
VL-kolkabsu 665.63 666.74 s0001 CALL OH 
VL-kolkabsu 666.74 672.30 s0001 A RACING IF SEEING A WHOLE A SAMPLE OF FUR SUPER CONDUCTOR 
VL-kolkabsu 672.30 673.98 s0001 AND IT IS KNOWN THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 673.98 675.17 s0001 WELL THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 675.17 681.01 s0001 HERE IS BECAUSE VERY SINGLE NOBLES THERE IS A SPECIAL GERMAN OF CURRENTS 
VL-kolkabsu 681.01 684.39 s0001 WHICH IT REDUCES REDSTONE WHO MY STATISTIC 
VL-kolkabsu 684.39 685.78 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 685.78 691.79 s0001 JUST BECAUSE AS YOU SIX OF THEM THEY DIDN'T DISCUSS A MAESTRO SOMETHING THAT IT 
VL-kolkabsu 691.79 692.95 s0001 BUT ER 
VL-kolkabsu 692.95 698.79 s0001 THEY DISCOVERED MANY SINKS LIKE THE USE OF THE RESERVE MY AS A MEASURE 
VL-kolkabsu 698.79 699.84 s0001 AND 
VL-kolkabsu 699.84 704.01 s0001 MISTER A SUPERCOMPUTER SO THEY INTRODUCE CRITICAL CURRENTLY INTERVIEWS 
VL-kolkabsu 704.01 708.71 s0001 CRITICAL FIELDS OF THESE ARE SO TO MAGNETIC FIELD USED TO PUT IN THE FUTURE 
VL-kolkabsu 708.71 710.73 s0001 AND WHAT IS INTERESTING 
VL-kolkabsu 710.73 712.15 s0001 THAT'S A 
VL-kolkabsu 712.51 714.41 s0001 RAWNESS 
VL-kolkabsu 714.41 716.31 s0001 HE BELIEVED THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 716.31 717.52 s0001 STEELE 
VL-kolkabsu 717.52 718.85 s0001 IF WE MAKE 
VL-kolkabsu 718.85 720.78 s0001 MIDDLE'S CUTE ENOUGH 
VL-kolkabsu 720.78 722.43 s0001 LINGERED SUPERCONDUCTING 
VL-kolkabsu 722.43 724.89 s0001 SO IN HIS NOMINAL EACH HE SAID THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 724.89 726.02 s0001 YEAH 
VL-kolkabsu 726.02 728.16 s0001 HE'S NO ADULTS THAT EVE 
VL-kolkabsu 728.16 729.75 s0001 PLATINUM AND 
VL-kolkabsu 729.75 730.90 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 730.90 732.22 s0001 A GOLD 
VL-kolkabsu 732.22 734.18 s0001 A FEW OF THESE 
VL-kolkabsu 734.67 736.46 s0001 MADE A 
VL-kolkabsu 736.46 737.70 s0001 CLEAN ENOUGH 
VL-kolkabsu 737.70 739.33 s0001 THEY HAVE A SUPER CONDUCTOR 
VL-kolkabsu 739.62 741.30 s0001 THE NEXT STAGE 
VL-kolkabsu 741.30 743.19 s0001 COMES A 
VL-kolkabsu 743.19 744.66 s0001 IN SODAS 
VL-kolkabsu 744.66 745.82 s0001 WHEN 
VL-kolkabsu 745.82 749.64 s0001 MY SNIFF IT WAS DISCOVERED MUST IF IT MEANS THAT THE 
VL-kolkabsu 749.64 751.15 s0001 SUPER CONDUCTORS ARE 
VL-kolkabsu 751.15 752.51 s0001 IDEAL 
VL-kolkabsu 752.51 754.64 s0001 OBAMA MEDICS IS A 
VL-kolkabsu 754.64 755.87 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 755.87 757.10 s0001 HOW TO SAY YEAH 
VL-kolkabsu 757.10 758.33 s0001 THEY DON'T LIKE 
VL-kolkabsu 758.33 762.17 s0001 MAGNETIC FIELD IN A HAVANA 
VL-kolkabsu 762.17 764.65 s0001 A BOARDROOM THEY FEEL IT 
VL-kolkabsu 765.14 767.01 s0001 SO AH 
VL-kolkabsu 767.01 769.34 s0001 THIS EFFECT WAS DISCOVERED 
VL-kolkabsu 769.34 772.56 s0001 AND BECAUSE AND THEY MIGHT AFFECT AND NOW 
VL-kolkabsu 772.56 776.08 s0001 WHEN WE DO ANY MEASUREMENT SOME SUPER CONDUCTORS 
VL-kolkabsu 776.08 781.22 s0001 IF YOU VOTE APPROVES THIS IS A VIEW SUPER CONDUCTOR SWITCH TO SHORE TO SINKS 
VL-kolkabsu 781.22 782.63 s0001 ONE THINK EASIER 
VL-kolkabsu 782.63 786.42 s0001 OBAMA NUDISM HAVE TO SHOW OF THE CO FOR WHEN IT IS ANCIENT 
VL-kolkabsu 786.42 790.11 s0001 AND JUST TO SHOW BECAUSE OF HIS ESTATE IS IN RESISTANCE 
VL-kolkabsu 790.11 791.90 s0001 AND MY STATISTIC 
VL-kolkabsu 792.07 794.27 s0001 AH AND THE 
VL-kolkabsu 794.27 797.81 s0001 IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT IS DIFFERENT FROM A 
VL-kolkabsu 797.81 799.83 s0001 THE IDEAL METALS 
VL-kolkabsu 799.83 801.37 s0001 AND AH 
VL-kolkabsu 801.37 803.17 s0001 TRACING SCIENCE LOAN THEM 
VL-kolkabsu 803.17 806.04 s0001 THEY ROLLED IN LOGICAL EQUATION 
VL-kolkabsu 806.42 809.70 s0001 IN THIRTY SIX OR SEVENTY EIGHT 
VL-kolkabsu 809.70 811.84 s0001 AH AH 
VL-kolkabsu 811.94 816.10 s0001 BECAUSE HE SECRETIONS ACTUALLY PRETTY SIMPLE 
VL-kolkabsu 816.10 818.42 s0001 IF I JUST ASSUMED THAT FLOW 
VL-kolkabsu 818.42 819.94 s0001 MY SUPER FRUIT 
VL-kolkabsu 819.94 821.14 s0001 BUT UM ONE 
VL-kolkabsu 821.14 827.56 s0001 TOUCHE SUPERCONDUCTING COMPONENTS OF THESE OLDER EQUATION IT MEANS OF IDEAL FLOOR 
VL-kolkabsu 827.56 833.30 s0001 THEY'RE ON A LONDON ACCRETION MEANS THAT I DON'T HAVE A VARIETY CITY 
VL-kolkabsu 833.30 835.83 s0001 SO NOTICE IN THE FLOW 
VL-kolkabsu 835.83 837.86 s0001 MEANS SLOAN IMMIGRATION 
VL-kolkabsu 837.86 839.18 s0001 JUST 
VL-kolkabsu 839.18 846.15 s0001 SIMPLE RIGHT INTO FOR OWNER EQUATIONS YOU CAN SEE THAT IF IT WAS OF THESE PER PHYSICAL TO DO THIS EXACTLY 
VL-kolkabsu 846.15 849.81 s0001 AS THE SAME AS ON THE CREATION 
VL-kolkabsu 849.81 853.32 s0001 SOME OF THE RESULTS APPEARED FIRST 
VL-kolkabsu 853.32 855.43 s0001 FROM THE MENTAL CONTINUES TO COME FROM 
VL-kolkabsu 855.43 862.28 s0001 A MICROSCOPIC PROPERTIES OF SUPER CONDUCTORS HIS AVANT AND INNOVATION THAT IT MEANS THAT MAGNETIC FIELD MANIPULATORS 
VL-kolkabsu 862.28 863.47 s0001 SUPER CONDUCTOR 
VL-kolkabsu 863.47 864.62 s0001 THEN IT'S 
VL-kolkabsu 864.62 866.08 s0001 TWO 
VL-kolkabsu 866.08 868.36 s0001 SUPERCONDUCTING BODY ONLY 
VL-kolkabsu 868.36 872.85 s0001 ON THE SODA LENGTH SCALE WHICH IS CALLED LONG AND INNOVATION TYPES 
VL-kolkabsu 873.93 877.77 s0001 WHICH IS OF COURSE MEASURE OF SUPER FRUIT DENSITY 
VL-kolkabsu 879.17 881.20 s0001 THEN THE NEXT 
VL-kolkabsu 881.20 883.27 s0001 A A 
VL-kolkabsu 883.27 885.42 s0001 MILESTONE IN THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 885.42 889.82 s0001 THE RESEARCH OF SUPER CAN THAT INTO US V. 
VL-kolkabsu 889.82 892.48 s0001 DISCOVERY A NON DISCOVERED ABOUT 
VL-kolkabsu 892.48 896.53 s0001 CONSTRUCTION CONDEMNING LOGICAL THEORY OF A A 
VL-kolkabsu 896.53 898.30 s0001 HIS BOOK AND LANDAU 
VL-kolkabsu 898.45 900.28 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 900.28 901.74 s0001 OH 
VL-kolkabsu 901.74 903.11 s0001 I MEAN 
VL-kolkabsu 903.11 906.44 s0001 AMONG RESEARCHERS THAT IS DIFFERENT OPINIONS 
VL-kolkabsu 906.44 907.74 s0001 BUT FOR EXAMPLE 
VL-kolkabsu 907.74 910.26 s0001 I JUST THE INCAN QUARTS OF 
VL-kolkabsu 910.26 913.01 s0001 A MILE FROM THESE NEW 
VL-kolkabsu 913.01 916.83 s0001 COOL GAVE A TALK IN ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO 
VL-kolkabsu 916.83 919.26 s0001 IN THE ESTIMATE HE SAID THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 919.26 921.58 s0001 BEGINS WORK ON THOSE YOUR REASON 
VL-kolkabsu 921.87 923.27 s0001 ONE OF THEM 
VL-kolkabsu 923.27 926.28 s0001 GREAT A THEORY OF TWO INCHES CENTURY 
VL-kolkabsu 926.28 928.46 s0001 PERSONALLY I SHARE THIS OPINION 
VL-kolkabsu 928.46 929.87 s0001 BECAUSE I LIKE IT 
VL-kolkabsu 929.87 934.69 s0001 NOW YOU ANTAGONISTS ALWAYS SAYING THAT IT IS JUST A LITTLE EXPUNGED 
VL-kolkabsu 934.70 938.10 s0001 YOU TO DO A LOT OF FUNCTIONS 
VL-kolkabsu 938.81 940.40 s0001 SO UM 
VL-kolkabsu 940.40 943.86 s0001 THIS STORY ALSO TOOK FROM MARKET IN A MINUTE 
VL-kolkabsu 943.86 947.69 s0001 A COOL WAS ACTUALLY A ITALY 
VL-kolkabsu 947.69 950.42 s0001 HIS WORK WAS HIS A. P. Z. ADVISER 
VL-kolkabsu 950.42 951.52 s0001 AND 
VL-kolkabsu 951.52 953.17 s0001 A KEEN 
VL-kolkabsu 953.17 955.51 s0001 TOLD THE STORY HOW OR 
VL-kolkabsu 955.51 957.57 s0001 HIS BOOK ARRIVE SO 
VL-kolkabsu 957.57 959.17 s0001 THESE DISCOVERIES 
VL-kolkabsu 959.17 964.66 s0001 HE ACTUALLY WANTED TO HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY ALONG THOSE WHO HAVE SUCCUMBED TO THE FIRST INCISION 
VL-kolkabsu 964.66 966.44 s0001 AND HE WANTED TO GO 
VL-kolkabsu 966.44 969.11 s0001 APPLIED THIS UNIT TO A 
VL-kolkabsu 969.11 970.74 s0001 TWO PROOFREADING 
VL-kolkabsu 970.74 973.04 s0001 IT WAS DISCOVERED IN THIRTY EIGHT 
VL-kolkabsu 973.27 974.88 s0001 AND THEN 
VL-kolkabsu 974.88 978.08 s0001 KILLING ASSAULT WHAT THESE ARE ALL OF THE PLANET 
VL-kolkabsu 978.08 986.34 s0001 BECAUSE THEY ORIGIN USE IT SUPERFICIALLY DENSITIES IT'S A THAT SOME OTHER PLANET THAT'S WHAT APPEARS BELOW T. C. 
VL-kolkabsu 986.34 987.72 s0001 UM THE POINT 
VL-kolkabsu 987.72 989.14 s0001 BUT YEAH 
VL-kolkabsu 989.14 995.20 s0001 THE PROBLEM WAS A SUPER FLUID DENSITY CAN LOBBY ON ALL THE TIME BECAUSE IT IS ALL OF THIS 
VL-kolkabsu 995.20 996.88 s0001 TAYLOR AND IT SHOULD BE 
VL-kolkabsu 996.88 999.05 s0001 IN SQUARE AND LANDAU THEORY 
VL-kolkabsu 999.05 1003.02 s0001 IT CANNOT BE MEAN YOU SUCK KILLED A SOCCER BALL SQUARE DON'T OF 
VL-kolkabsu 1003.02 1005.11 s0001 SUPER THROUGH DENSITY 
VL-kolkabsu 1005.30 1008.81 s0001 BUT SCRIBBLED HIS CELLPHONE LOOKS VERY GOOD 
VL-kolkabsu 1008.81 1015.36 s0001 AND OF COURSE CAN USE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS OF DENSITY IS A SQUARE OBSERVE FUNCTION 
VL-kolkabsu 1015.36 1018.30 s0001 AND THIS IS A VIEW HE CAME TO ONE NOW 
VL-kolkabsu 1018.42 1024.36 s0001 AND THAT'S HOW WAS A PIECE A TUNA 
VL-kolkabsu 1024.36 1025.89 s0001 OR STATIC 
VL-kolkabsu 1026.17 1029.28 s0001 SO I MEAN IT WAS A LOT OF UM 
VL-kolkabsu 1029.28 1030.79 s0001 DETAILS 
VL-kolkabsu 1030.79 1037.01 s0001 A VOTE IS A A THEORY I JUST FILL YOU ONLY ONE 
VL-kolkabsu 1037.01 1042.95 s0001 AS YOU I MEAN IN CONTEMPORARY FORMULATION CAN ALL BECAUSE OF THIS IS THE CHALLENGE 
VL-kolkabsu 1042.95 1046.92 s0001 BECAUSE ALL THE PLANET IS COUPLED TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD 
VL-kolkabsu 1046.92 1049.74 s0001 AND THAT'S WHERE THE QUANTUM MECHANICS A SCUM 
VL-kolkabsu 1049.74 1052.78 s0001 THIS IS A SERIES PURE QUANTUM MECHANICAL BECAUSE 
VL-kolkabsu 1052.78 1056.25 s0001 YOU CANNOT AVOID EACH IN SERIE AGE BAR 
VL-kolkabsu 1056.25 1057.44 s0001 HE'S COME IN 
VL-kolkabsu 1057.44 1064.96 s0001 EITHER YOU CAN WRITE IT LIKE FEEL LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT HERE OR YOU CAN YOU CAN LOOK AVOIDED THAT SHOULD BE IN THE FLUX PLANT 
VL-kolkabsu 1064.96 1066.81 s0001 BUT SPUN AGE BAR 
VL-kolkabsu 1066.81 1068.28 s0001 IT'S QUANTUM 
VL-kolkabsu 1068.39 1070.34 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 1070.34 1072.20 s0001 WELL JEEZ CHAD 
VL-kolkabsu 1072.20 1073.38 s0001 OF COURSE 
VL-kolkabsu 1073.38 1075.13 s0001 THEY SORT IS 
VL-kolkabsu 1075.13 1077.21 s0001 EAT OR NOT EAT 
VL-kolkabsu 1077.69 1080.11 s0001 AND AND ALSO AN ARGUMENT 
VL-kolkabsu 1080.32 1083.86 s0001 ARGUMENT WAS EVEN ICE USE OF THE BOOK EAT 
VL-kolkabsu 1083.86 1087.92 s0001 IT MEANS THAT I JUST US YOU'LL THAT IT MIGHT BE SPATIAL DEPENDENT 
VL-kolkabsu 1087.92 1090.53 s0001 BUT SPATIAL DEPENDENCE BREAKS 
VL-kolkabsu 1090.53 1092.84 s0001 ENGAGE ADVANCES THIS EQUATION 
VL-kolkabsu 1092.84 1095.00 s0001 THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE EASY 
VL-kolkabsu 1095.05 1099.00 s0001 SO ZEROTH EAST I'M IN THEIR HEAD 
VL-kolkabsu 1099.00 1100.15 s0001 A A 
VL-kolkabsu 1100.15 1103.02 s0001 PUBLICATIONS BUT I COULDN'T FIND IN THE LIBRARY 
VL-kolkabsu 1103.02 1106.20 s0001 WHEN A GROUP OF JUST COULDN'T FIND THE ORIGINAL PAPER 
VL-kolkabsu 1106.20 1107.34 s0001 FOR SOME REASON 
VL-kolkabsu 1107.34 1108.99 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 1108.99 1110.16 s0001 THIS 
VL-kolkabsu 1110.16 1112.94 s0001 ISSUE IS ABSENT FROM OUR 
VL-kolkabsu 1112.94 1114.30 s0001 EVERYTHING 
VL-kolkabsu 1114.30 1115.68 s0001 I'M IN 
VL-kolkabsu 1115.68 1118.17 s0001 AND ZEROS A UM 
VL-kolkabsu 1118.17 1119.81 s0001 IT SHOULD BE IN 
VL-kolkabsu 1120.92 1126.04 s0001 HE STARTED BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS DIFFERENT FROM EAT 
VL-kolkabsu 1126.04 1130.00 s0001 IN REALITY OF COURSE AFTER THIS PERIOD OF HIS PARENTS OWN 
VL-kolkabsu 1130.00 1131.86 s0001 YOU KNOW THAT IT IS TO EAT 
VL-kolkabsu 1133.23 1141.19 s0001 AND IN A MOMENT OF COURSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE SECOND HIS WORK ON THE QUESTION OF IS THE SAME AS A LITTLE AGGRESSION IF YOU FORGET ABOUT 
VL-kolkabsu 1141.19 1142.63 s0001 THIS PART OF KARMA 
VL-kolkabsu 1142.63 1144.90 s0001 WE JUST CALLED OUR MAGNETIC BUT 
VL-kolkabsu 1144.90 1148.08 s0001 CURRENTLY ONLY USER THEM ADMIT IT CAN 
VL-kolkabsu 1148.08 1149.67 s0001 IF IF LONG IMMIGRATION 
VL-kolkabsu 1149.67 1153.91 s0001 YES WE HAVE TWO MEMBERS OF HER CURRENT IS EQUAL TO A 
VL-kolkabsu 1153.91 1155.72 s0001 THE CONTROL OF THEM 
VL-kolkabsu 1155.72 1157.14 s0001 EACH 
VL-kolkabsu 1158.84 1160.82 s0001 THE NEXT POINT 
VL-kolkabsu 1161.23 1163.36 s0001 ALSO VERY INTERESTING 
VL-kolkabsu 1163.36 1164.63 s0001 USER 
VL-kolkabsu 1164.63 1167.77 s0001 DISCOVERY OF PRACTICE OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING 
VL-kolkabsu 1168.34 1170.25 s0001 THIS IS A 
VL-kolkabsu 1170.42 1174.84 s0001 ACTUALLY DURING HIS STAY IN A LIGHT AND LABOR 
VL-kolkabsu 1174.84 1176.12 s0001 YEAH NICK OF 
VL-kolkabsu 1176.12 1177.22 s0001 ORGY 
VL-kolkabsu 1177.22 1180.10 s0001 PUBLISHER PAPERS AS THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT 
VL-kolkabsu 1180.10 1181.98 s0001 TYPE OF SUPER CONDUCTORS 
VL-kolkabsu 1181.98 1183.44 s0001 MAGNETIC 
VL-kolkabsu 1183.44 1186.20 s0001 A A MOMENT OF THEM IS 
VL-kolkabsu 1186.20 1190.60 s0001 STRONGLY DEPENDS ON THE TWENTY TWO PISTOL YOU DIFFERENT 
VL-kolkabsu 1190.60 1192.20 s0001 OF COURSE 
VL-kolkabsu 1192.33 1194.78 s0001 HE COULDN'T THROW A 
VL-kolkabsu 1194.78 1198.87 s0001 CLASS MAKE A CLASSIFICATION CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES KING LATER 
VL-kolkabsu 1198.87 1199.92 s0001 BUT 
VL-kolkabsu 1199.92 1202.52 s0001 IN GIVES ONE THOUSAND IS ANOTHER 
VL-kolkabsu 1202.52 1205.30 s0001 LENGTH SCALE WHICH IS EXCITING AND THAT IS IT 
VL-kolkabsu 1205.30 1206.91 s0001 YOU MENTIONED THIS PARAMETER 
VL-kolkabsu 1206.91 1209.69 s0001 EACH IS A RATIO OF THESE TWO LENGTH SCALE 
VL-kolkabsu 1209.69 1211.64 s0001 HE JUST CALLED ER 
VL-kolkabsu 1211.64 1213.09 s0001 HE'S WORKED ON THE PLANET 
VL-kolkabsu 1213.09 1216.21 s0001 CAN BE MORE SOME PLOT OF UH SQUARES OF TWO 
VL-kolkabsu 1216.21 1219.19 s0001 THEREFORE ALL THE POTENTIAL FOR THE COURSE OF 
VL-kolkabsu 1219.25 1220.65 s0001 COOL 
VL-kolkabsu 1220.65 1223.03 s0001 AND SEE THAT SUCH A SITUATION LOSS 
VL-kolkabsu 1223.03 1224.78 s0001 CAME TO CRITICISE 
VL-kolkabsu 1225.02 1226.76 s0001 AND 
VL-kolkabsu 1226.76 1232.21 s0001 AND AT LEAST AS IT IS AND IT CAN ENDEAR BECAUSE A PHONE NUMBER PRESS NATURE 
VL-kolkabsu 1232.21 1233.41 s0001 HE 
VL-kolkabsu 1233.41 1235.64 s0001 BECOME SEEK AND HER 
VL-kolkabsu 1235.64 1239.61 s0001 WHEN STILL CLOSE BUT UNTIL NOW DECIDED TO VISIT HIM 
VL-kolkabsu 1239.61 1242.52 s0001 AT ONE POINT HE NOTICES 
VL-kolkabsu 1242.52 1243.99 s0001 IAN 
VL-kolkabsu 1246.08 1253.82 s0001 TABLE TO TABLE IT WAS AN OLD BOOK OF RECORDS OF WERE IT WAS LONG AND THE QUESTION IS A FUNCTIONAL INSIDE 
VL-kolkabsu 1253.82 1255.30 s0001 SO IT IS 
VL-kolkabsu 1255.82 1258.55 s0001 COLORED EQUATION FOR A VORTEX 
VL-kolkabsu 1259.58 1261.85 s0001 HE SAID FOR HIM OKAY 
VL-kolkabsu 1261.85 1264.70 s0001 YEAH SEEK NOW BUT WHEN THEY BECOME 
VL-kolkabsu 1264.70 1266.02 s0001 I 
VL-kolkabsu 1266.02 1271.98 s0001 THE YOU KNOW WHETHER WE TALK ABOUT IT AND I'M APPEARED THE PAPER OF FINE MUM 
VL-kolkabsu 1271.98 1273.27 s0001 WHERE HE DISCUSS 
VL-kolkabsu 1273.27 1275.22 s0001 FORTY SHE'S IN A 
VL-kolkabsu 1275.22 1276.77 s0001 HE COULD HE DO 
VL-kolkabsu 1276.77 1279.09 s0001 THEN UNDOUBTEDLY IN 
VL-kolkabsu 1279.09 1280.64 s0001 HIS FATHER 
VL-kolkabsu 1280.64 1281.80 s0001 GORGON'S IT

VL-kolkabsu 1285.34 1288.59 s0001 YOU'D GONE DON'T CREATION AND SENDING IT TO FLY CHAPTER 
VL-kolkabsu 1288.59 1293.41 s0001 AND HOUSES THEORY OF THE SECOND A SECOND THAT TO SUPERCONDUCTING IT IS YES 
VL-kolkabsu 1293.41 1296.56 s0001 SO WHAT IS IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU APPLY MAGNETIC FIELD 
VL-kolkabsu 1296.56 1298.43 s0001 THE TYPE TWO SUPER CONDUCTORS 
VL-kolkabsu 1298.43 1300.12 s0001 THEY CANNOT RATES 
VL-kolkabsu 1300.12 1301.22 s0001 COOL 
VL-kolkabsu 1301.22 1302.54 s0001 BULK 
VL-kolkabsu 1302.54 1304.68 s0001 AS A 
VL-kolkabsu 1304.84 1309.24 s0001 SINGLE CORTICES IT'S LIKE CUBISM MAGNETIC FIELD 
VL-kolkabsu 1311.59 1313.09 s0001 HALL SOME 
VL-kolkabsu 1313.09 1314.49 s0001 HOW 
VL-kolkabsu 1314.50 1317.03 s0001 NEXT STEP WAS A 
VL-kolkabsu 1317.55 1321.41 s0001 THIS GIRL I'M IN THE CREATION OF THEIR 
VL-kolkabsu 1321.41 1322.55 s0001 ANOTHER 
VL-kolkabsu 1322.55 1326.75 s0001 TINA OF THING TO CENTURY IS THIS YOUR THEORY WHICH 
VL-kolkabsu 1326.75 1329.30 s0001 OF GOOD NUMBER PRICE 
VL-kolkabsu 1329.30 1331.09 s0001 FIFTEEN YEARS LATER ON 
VL-kolkabsu 1331.09 1332.89 s0001 THESE THREE YEAH 
VL-kolkabsu 1332.89 1334.73 s0001 BUT COULD POTENTIALLY FIFTH 
VL-kolkabsu 1334.73 1340.08 s0001 AND EVER SINCE STARTED THROWING GAME OWN LITTLE BIT MEAN PROBLEM 
VL-kolkabsu 1340.08 1344.13 s0001 WHO JUST CAN SEE THE TWO ELECTRONS FEATURE MORE GOING ON THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 1344.13 1351.30 s0001 JEREMY SURFACE JUSTIN'S OF MIXED UP OBJECTS MOVE IN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE EMBASSY AND 
VL-kolkabsu 1351.30 1357.74 s0001 IN EACH CASE AND A FRACTION THAT INS AND UNCONTROLLED IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE MOTION ON THE SURFACE THESE TWO DIMENSIONAL 
VL-kolkabsu 1357.74 1364.91 s0001 EVERY POTENTIAL SAYS A COLLECTIVE POTENTIALS HAS A LEVEL SO HE MADE IT CLEAR 
VL-kolkabsu 1364.91 1366.62 s0001 A FOLLOW THE 
VL-kolkabsu 1366.62 1368.26 s0001 THE V. A. 
VL-kolkabsu 1368.26 1371.28 s0001 HE IS A BONE STATE 
VL-kolkabsu 1372.28 1375.92 s0001 A A 
VL-kolkabsu 1375.92 1380.30 s0001 ESSENTIALLY PERIOD TO PERIOD THIS YEAR SEARING REACH 
VL-kolkabsu 1380.30 1381.86 s0001 I MEAN 
VL-kolkabsu 1381.86 1384.28 s0001 OKAY IT'S HE'S A 
VL-kolkabsu 1384.28 1385.80 s0001 SO IT'S UM 
VL-kolkabsu 1385.80 1390.37 s0001 OR THE PARAMETER OF EACH SHE'S OR A PROPORTIONAL TO HE'S GOT 
VL-kolkabsu 1390.37 1392.85 s0001 AND THE SPECTRUM BECOME GOT 
VL-kolkabsu 1392.85 1397.40 s0001 SPECTRUM OF BASED ON DO VICTIMS WAS GOING TO BE VERY NEAR MOVER 
VL-kolkabsu 1397.40 1400.71 s0001 HE'S A HE'S A FRAME OF A OF THE CURRENT 
VL-kolkabsu 1400.71 1406.79 s0001 AH I DON'T CARE FOR WOMEN TO TAKE SUFFICIENT SUSPENDED JUST THAT SHOULD NEVER CROSSES ERA 
VL-kolkabsu 1406.79 1410.41 s0001 SO IS IT'S NOT THE CASE FOR THE DUVET SUPER CONDUCTOR 
VL-kolkabsu 1410.58 1416.82 s0001 IN SO DOING SUPER CONDUCTOR IF I HAVE TO USE OF THE INFORMATION A 
VL-kolkabsu 1416.82 1418.71 s0001 A TWO THEY'RE MOVING FRAME 
VL-kolkabsu 1418.71 1420.00 s0001 I ALWAYS HE EVER 
VL-kolkabsu 1420.00 1422.69 s0001 Z. IT NEGATIVE BRANCHES OF SPECTRUM 
VL-kolkabsu 1422.69 1424.96 s0001 AND BECAUSE IT IS A QUESTION WAY 
VL-kolkabsu 1424.96 1428.04 s0001 AND YOU RE SUPERCONDUCTING SUPER CONDUCT 
VL-kolkabsu 1429.36 1431.87 s0001 SO I'M IN THIS SERIES 
VL-kolkabsu 1431.87 1435.14 s0001 REGIONAL KNOWN COMMUNITIES PUBLISHED IN THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 1435.14 1439.37 s0001 THIRTY PAGES OF THE PHYSICAL TO THE PHYSICAL OR YOU BE 
VL-kolkabsu 1439.37 1440.42 s0001 I MEAN 
VL-kolkabsu 1440.42 1442.34 s0001 BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW 
VL-kolkabsu 1442.85 1445.14 s0001 THOUSANDS OF CITATIONS 
VL-kolkabsu 1445.35 1446.75 s0001 THOUSANDS 
VL-kolkabsu 1446.75 1447.80 s0001 NOT THOUSANDS 
VL-kolkabsu 1447.80 1449.20 s0001 MANY THOUSANDS 
VL-kolkabsu 1449.22 1456.45 s0001 SO BASICALLY I'M IN A MAIN POINT OF THIS SERIES OF THESE ARE 
VL-kolkabsu 1456.45 1458.86 s0001 NOT PROPER BOUND STATE OF 
VL-kolkabsu 1458.86 1460.00 s0001 WILL ENTRANCE 
VL-kolkabsu 1460.00 1463.43 s0001 THE REASON FOR THAT ARE UNDER WHICH MAKES SPIT DUCKED 
VL-kolkabsu 1463.59 1465.34 s0001 AND 
VL-kolkabsu 1465.72 1467.12 s0001 SECOND 
VL-kolkabsu 1467.12 1469.42 s0001 POINT IS THAT IF I APPLY 
VL-kolkabsu 1469.42 1470.64 s0001 EXTENDS ALL 
VL-kolkabsu 1470.64 1471.86 s0001 FIELD OR 
VL-kolkabsu 1471.86 1472.98 s0001 I 
VL-kolkabsu 1472.98 1476.92 s0001 THE CURRENT FLOW OF HIS OBSERVATION BECAUSE OF LONG OKAY 
VL-kolkabsu 1479.29 1481.95 s0001 OF COURSE A 
VL-kolkabsu 1481.95 1483.30 s0001 IT WAS 
VL-kolkabsu 1483.30 1484.54 s0001 THEORY 
VL-kolkabsu 1484.54 1490.84 s0001 WHEN YOU WILL DEVELOP MEDICATING THE TEN YEARS AFTER DISCOVERED OF SUPER CAN THE KENNEDY SAID THE 
VL-kolkabsu 1490.84 1493.10 s0001 ALL POSSIBLE 
VL-kolkabsu 1493.10 1498.04 s0001 GRATION SWITCH WE USE IN HOW LIKE AVAILABLE VISION EQUATIONS 
VL-kolkabsu 1498.04 1500.83 s0001 UH GET GO FOR CREATIONS THE 
VL-kolkabsu 1500.83 1506.59 s0001 GAZA CLASSICAL EQUATIONS SCHOOLS OF THEN AND THE ALIEN BED AGREE EVERYTHING WAS DONE 
VL-kolkabsu 1507.32 1508.72 s0001 AND THE 
VL-kolkabsu 1508.72 1516.33 s0001 SHARM AND REDDISH OF DISCUSSIONS WAS AND SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES AS FAR AS A HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING THAT IS CANCER 
VL-kolkabsu 1516.33 1517.92 s0001 SO THE TIME 
VL-kolkabsu 1517.92 1520.49 s0001 I ALREADY REMEMBER MYSELF 
VL-kolkabsu 1520.49 1521.90 s0001 OF THE TIME 
VL-kolkabsu 1521.90 1525.54 s0001 HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPER CONDUCTORS WAS A FIFTEEN SUPER COMBATED 
VL-kolkabsu 1525.54 1527.91 s0001 THE COMPOUNDS SUPER CONDUCTOR 
VL-kolkabsu 1527.91 1529.52 s0001 SNAIL ROOM 
VL-kolkabsu 1529.52 1530.65 s0001 HE 
VL-kolkabsu 1530.65 1535.11 s0001 THE TEAM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS A CRITICAL TEMPERATURE BOAST TWENTY KELVIN 
VL-kolkabsu 1535.11 1538.23 s0001 THEY CONSIDERED TO BE OF ANY YEAH 
VL-kolkabsu 1539.43 1546.73 s0001 THESE HIGH PROBABILITY OF PUBLICATION IN A A A TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS LET'S SEE 
VL-kolkabsu 1547.60 1555.10 s0001 AND FOR EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE DID SAID THAT FAMILY ROLLERS INVESTIGATE HOW OF BE 
VL-kolkabsu 1555.10 1560.74 s0001 THERE'S THIS TYPE OF SUPER CONDUCTORS ARE SENSITIVE TOOL FOR EXAMPLE EXTEND OR A DEVIATION 
VL-kolkabsu 1560.74 1564.92 s0001 BECAUSE WHEN YOU MORE WITH TWO BUCKS IN THE RADAR OR WHATEVER 
VL-kolkabsu 1564.92 1566.37 s0001 THERE IS THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 1566.37 1572.16 s0001 CERTAIN TYPE OF ADDITION AND IT MIGHT DAMAGE SUPERCONDUCTING LIKE A FIFTEEN COMPOUNDED 
VL-kolkabsu 1572.16 1573.82 s0001 IN GIVES IT IS QUITE A SHOT 
VL-kolkabsu 1573.82 1576.55 s0001 BECAUSE OF CRITICAL TEMPERATURE BECAUSE OF THIS IT 
VL-kolkabsu 1576.84 1578.59 s0001 AND 
VL-kolkabsu 1579.35 1585.20 s0001 SOME SOMEBODY CAN SAY IS THAT IT IS DISASTER SOMEBODY SINCE THE GREAT DISCOVERED IT 
VL-kolkabsu 1585.20 1586.46 s0001 IF YOU CAN 
VL-kolkabsu 1586.46 1589.30 s0001 AND OF A TO SWIM AND 
VL-kolkabsu 1589.34 1594.59 s0001 YOU'RE NOT AND ALEX MILLER DISCOTHEQUE AND WHICH SUPER CONDUCTORS 
VL-kolkabsu 1594.59 1596.21 s0001 AS A BANK 
VL-kolkabsu 1596.29 1598.59 s0001 NOW I'M IN A 
VL-kolkabsu 1598.59 1600.08 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 1600.30 1601.84 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 1601.84 1603.98 s0001 IT WAS REALLY 
VL-kolkabsu 1603.98 1605.38 s0001 I'M IN 
VL-kolkabsu 1605.38 1607.52 s0001 VERY ESSENTIAL AMOUNT 
VL-kolkabsu 1607.52 1613.98 s0001 BECAUSE EVERYONE SORT CERTIFICATE SUPER CONDUCTOR SIR BUFFER BIG NITROGEN POINT 
VL-kolkabsu 1613.98 1616.38 s0001 IT WILL BE WIDELY USED 
VL-kolkabsu 1616.38 1619.37 s0001 OR IN A DAY 
VL-kolkabsu 1619.37 1620.84 s0001 AT HOME 
VL-kolkabsu 1620.84 1623.86 s0001 WHAT WAS SECTION IN NORTH 
VL-kolkabsu 1623.86 1625.49 s0001 SO SIMPLE 
VL-kolkabsu 1625.49 1627.39 s0001 I'M AM I HERE FOR 
VL-kolkabsu 1627.39 1628.96 s0001 COMBING ALL 
VL-kolkabsu 1628.96 1633.37 s0001 SO IT WILL BE THIRTY YEARS OF THE DISCOVERY OF BUT IT'S STILL NOT LETTING 
VL-kolkabsu 1633.37 1634.78 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 1635.04 1636.64 s0001 MANY 
VL-kolkabsu 1636.64 1637.92 s0001 DEVICE 
VL-kolkabsu 1637.92 1639.09 s0001 THAT YOU HEAR 
VL-kolkabsu 1639.09 1640.54 s0001 THE MARKET 
VL-kolkabsu 1640.54 1642.17 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 1642.60 1648.55 s0001 IN CHILE FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR DEPARTMENT WAS A GROUP OR WHICH WAS WORKING ON THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 1648.55 1649.87 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 1649.87 1654.06 s0001 BUT I SOON BY REAL MUM LEAD OXIDES 
VL-kolkabsu 1654.06 1655.48 s0001 WHICH IS 
VL-kolkabsu 1655.48 1656.64 s0001 FOR MONEY 
VL-kolkabsu 1656.64 1659.16 s0001 BELONGS TO THE SAME CLASS OF MATERIALS 
VL-kolkabsu 1659.16 1662.68 s0001 AND ONE JUST A PORTAL FOR A A 
VL-kolkabsu 1662.68 1664.68 s0001 THE NORTON NEAR APPEARED 
VL-kolkabsu 1664.68 1669.13 s0001 THIS WAS VERY QUICKLY SYNTHESIZED AN HOUR OF WORK TO DO SO 
VL-kolkabsu 1669.13 1672.82 s0001 OUR LABORERS WHO WAS ALMOST THE FIRST OF THE SOVIET UNION WHICH HAVE THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 1672.82 1674.51 s0001 HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING 
VL-kolkabsu 1674.51 1676.22 s0001 PICTURE THAT'S A SORT OF 
VL-kolkabsu 1676.22 1678.30 s0001 YOU KNOW HIM OR HER 
VL-kolkabsu 1681.08 1683.27 s0001 NOW LET ME 
VL-kolkabsu 1684.00 1685.75 s0001 COME DO 
VL-kolkabsu 1685.90 1687.66 s0001 WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
VL-kolkabsu 1687.66 1689.12 s0001 IN OUR LUCK 
VL-kolkabsu 1689.12 1693.35 s0001 FIRST OF ALL I WOULD SAY THAT IF WE DIVIDE 
VL-kolkabsu 1693.35 1695.41 s0001 ALL THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY 
VL-kolkabsu 1695.41 1696.65 s0001 YEAH 
VL-kolkabsu 1696.65 1698.70 s0001 WHICH I WORK IN IN 
VL-kolkabsu 1698.70 1704.14 s0001 THE FIELD OF SUPERCOMPUTING TWO PARTS OF THE FIRST PART ISN'T LET'S SAY 
VL-kolkabsu 1704.14 1711.49 s0001 PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED MECHANISM SHOULD AND THAT IT IS US IN LAW ON A MECHANISM IS SOMETHING WHICH YOU NEVER CAN DETERMINE 
VL-kolkabsu 1711.49 1715.93 s0001 THERE IS SO LITTLE OF EXPERIMENTS WHICH WE CAN DESIGN 
VL-kolkabsu 1715.93 1723.44 s0001 A AND DO WHAT MEANS FOR MONTHS OR MORE FORMAL SCHOOLING TOO GOOD TO SUPER CONVICTED OF CAN BE DETERMINED EXPERIMENTALLY 
VL-kolkabsu 1723.44 1724.59 s0001 DIFFICULT 
VL-kolkabsu 1724.59 1729.65 s0001 THERE IS NO ALL YES AND NO EXTENSIONS OF FIELD SO LET US NOT TO DO INNOCENT 
VL-kolkabsu 1729.65 1736.33 s0001 AND HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPER CONDUCTORS FOR ME IS NOTHING ELSE THAN SUPER CONDUCTOR WERE THE BY TEMPERATURE IS NOT 
VL-kolkabsu 1736.33 1739.76 s0001 SO DIFFERENT FROM CRITICAL TEMPERATURES THERE'S ONLY DIFFERENT 
VL-kolkabsu 1740.04 1743.17 s0001 THAT'S YEAH I COULD SUCH AN OPINION 
VL-kolkabsu 1743.17 1746.91 s0001 ANOTHER THE GROWTH BY FAR THE BIGGEST 
VL-kolkabsu 1746.91 1749.42 s0001 ON THEIR CENTER NOT NOW 
VL-kolkabsu 1749.42 1753.42 s0001 EVEN IF IT IS VERY DIFFICULT BUT WE STILL WOULD LIKE TO FISH 
VL-kolkabsu 1753.42 1755.40 s0001 IN THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 1757.41 1759.15 s0001 YOU KNOW IN 
VL-kolkabsu 1759.15 1761.01 s0001 YEAH 
VL-kolkabsu 1761.01 1762.78 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 1762.78 1767.82 s0001 A FUN OF THE COMMUNITY REACH IS A UM A 
VL-kolkabsu 1767.82 1770.19 s0001 AND LET'S SEE ALSO 
VL-kolkabsu 1770.19 1773.18 s0001 QUITE WELL KNOWN ISN'T A 
VL-kolkabsu 1773.44 1776.38 s0001 IT'S NOT NECESSARILY FORM BASED 
VL-kolkabsu 1776.38 1779.13 s0001 IT'S BORN WASN'T BASED SO IT MEANS OF 
VL-kolkabsu 1779.13 1782.48 s0001 THE BINOCULARS BECAUSE OF EXCHANGE OF BALLS ON 
VL-kolkabsu 1782.48 1786.03 s0001 IN THIS ERA OF COURSE WAS SO STEEP CAN BUY IT AT A VERY 
VL-kolkabsu 1786.03 1787.32 s0001 IN 
VL-kolkabsu 1787.32 1788.52 s0001 SIXTIES 
VL-kolkabsu 1788.52 1790.12 s0001 AND AH 
VL-kolkabsu 1790.12 1791.54 s0001 IT'S 
VL-kolkabsu 1791.54 1793.18 s0001 THREE TO FOUR FORMS 
VL-kolkabsu 1793.18 1797.33 s0001 SO MY IN A IN GRAD INSULZA SCENERY ARE A 
VL-kolkabsu 1797.33 1799.64 s0001 QUITE SIMPLE SO 
VL-kolkabsu 1799.64 1802.34 s0001 HE PERMITS RISES V. 
VL-kolkabsu 1802.34 1803.49 s0001 RELATIONS 
VL-kolkabsu 1803.49 1806.78 s0001 SO APOSTLES TWO ELECTRODES IN TERMS OF COOLANT OF THE POTENTIAL 
VL-kolkabsu 1806.78 1813.47 s0001 ALL OF THE SUPER CONDUCTOR SIR THE TIME WAS JUST THE MEDALS OF COURSE IS A LIGHT SHADE OF THE SURFACE 
VL-kolkabsu 1813.47 1814.94 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 1814.94 1818.63 s0001 LAUNCHES A POTENTIAL ASSUME TO BE NOT BIG ENOUGH 
VL-kolkabsu 1818.63 1821.59 s0001 TO CAUSE INSTABILITY JUST SEVENTEEN 
VL-kolkabsu 1822.13 1823.58 s0001 AND 
VL-kolkabsu 1823.58 1828.71 s0001 IT WAS A INTERESTING MOMENTS IN THIS ERA OF THE EARTH 
VL-kolkabsu 1828.71 1831.86 s0001 WELL AS FAR AS THAT IS CONCERNED 
VL-kolkabsu 1832.40 1835.33 s0001 COOL THAT HAVE ALSO IS A 
VL-kolkabsu 1835.33 1836.70 s0001 STONE HAD USED 
VL-kolkabsu 1836.70 1838.84 s0001 BECAUSE OF LITIGATION 
VL-kolkabsu 1838.84 1844.29 s0001 SO IT MEANS A LITTLE INFORMAL LONG CALL IS CREATED 
VL-kolkabsu 1844.29 1850.64 s0001 THE SECOND TO LIFT THEM AS SECURE FAR AWAY FROM THAT ONE SAW THAT MEANS THAT IT IS ADDITIONAL 
VL-kolkabsu 1850.64 1852.79 s0001 A RANGE EVEN OR 
VL-kolkabsu 1852.79 1854.52 s0001 THINK INSIDIOUS SO 
VL-kolkabsu 1854.52 1856.55 s0001 THESE ARE 
VL-kolkabsu 1856.67 1859.42 s0001 COOL TO THE POTENTIAL IS USED 
VL-kolkabsu 1859.42 1860.75 s0001 TWO NEW STAR 
VL-kolkabsu 1860.75 1862.07 s0001 AND NEW STAR 
VL-kolkabsu 1862.07 1864.61 s0001 THISTLE THAT IF MIZ USUALLY COLD THOUGH 
VL-kolkabsu 1864.61 1867.74 s0001 BUT DIFFERENT THE PEOPLE WHO WENT OF HIS BOOK 
VL-kolkabsu 1867.74 1874.70 s0001 WHERE OFTEN WITH THIS CALLED THE MORAL AND OTHER CELEBRITIES WHO BUT THE NATIONAL EDITION THAT'S CALLED DO MUCH OF ANYTHING BECAUSE 
VL-kolkabsu 1874.70 1876.03 s0001 IT WAS A CHILLING 
VL-kolkabsu 1876.03 1880.99 s0001 HE IS BEFORE MORAL AND UNDER SOME PAPERWORK HE INVENTED 
VL-kolkabsu 1881.31 1888.88 s0001 THIS IS FROM THE LUO SCHOOL I DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT WORK OF A GLOBAL FROM THAT IS RUN IN THIS IS A SEPARATE SUBJECT 
VL-kolkabsu 1888.88 1890.40 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 1890.56 1897.66 s0001 THAT IS A PROBLEM OF THE SEAT OF COURSE WHEN YOU WANT TO CHECK HERE IN EXPERIMENTAL LOOKED IF INDEPENDENT 
VL-kolkabsu 1897.66 1902.72 s0001 ESTIMATES OF DIFFERENT PLANET US UH FROM DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS 
VL-kolkabsu 1902.72 1904.52 s0001 THESE GUYS THIS TIME 
VL-kolkabsu 1904.52 1907.44 s0001 HE IS ONLY INS A SUPERCONDUCTING EIGHTY SERIES 
VL-kolkabsu 1907.44 1910.57 s0001 SO THAT MEANS THAT IF A RIGHT HE IS EQUAL 
VL-kolkabsu 1910.57 1914.85 s0001 SOME FUNCTION OF FAILING TO PHONE COUPLING CONSTANT THAN A STAR 
VL-kolkabsu 1914.85 1917.33 s0001 IT MEANS THAT I I SAY NOTHING 
VL-kolkabsu 1917.33 1919.43 s0001 I CAN GET IT RIGHT 
VL-kolkabsu 1919.43 1921.68 s0001 I COULD NOT MISSUS MISTER 
VL-kolkabsu 1922.16 1930.74 s0001 SO USUALLY PEOPLE USE SUN ANALOGY LET'S TAKE FROM CERTAIN ASSUMES THAT IT IS THE SAME FOR ANOTHER AND 
VL-kolkabsu 1930.74 1932.17 s0001 IT'S 
VL-kolkabsu 1932.17 1933.63 s0001 SOME 
VL-kolkabsu 1933.63 1935.31 s0001 SOME BUSINESS LINES 
VL-kolkabsu 1935.64 1937.16 s0001 IN OTHER 
VL-kolkabsu 1937.16 1941.60 s0001 QUANTITY OF EACH COMES TO SERIES OF CIRCLES AND FUNCTION 
VL-kolkabsu 1941.60 1944.25 s0001 EACH PLANET EYES IN A TELEPHONE SUCTION 
VL-kolkabsu 1944.25 1949.70 s0001 SO AS YOU KNOW ELECTRONS AND FORMER MODEL IN THAT IS A INTERNET TO WANT TO EACH OTHER 
VL-kolkabsu 1949.70 1952.76 s0001 SO HE INTRODUCED SUCH A SPECTRAL FUNCTION 
VL-kolkabsu 1952.76 1954.68 s0001 WHICH CHARACTERISES 
VL-kolkabsu 1954.93 1959.02 s0001 UPON PRODUCTION THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS 
VL-kolkabsu 1959.82 1966.70 s0001 IT DEPENDS ON ENERGY ON FOLLOW NUISANCE ENSEMBLE THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL SIMPLIFICATION 
VL-kolkabsu 1966.70 1967.93 s0001 BECAUSE 
VL-kolkabsu 1967.93 1972.76 s0001 ALL THIS ELECTRONIC IMAGES OF A SEMI AND MANAGES ELECTION MIDDLE 
VL-kolkabsu 1972.76 1976.06 s0001 THEREFORE YOU CAN AH 
VL-kolkabsu 1976.06 1977.63 s0001 COLD 
VL-kolkabsu 1977.63 1978.89 s0001 JUST 
VL-kolkabsu 1978.89 1979.99 s0001 THIS FUNCTION 
VL-kolkabsu 1979.99 1981.88 s0001 SIGH EQUAL TO MANAGE 
VL-kolkabsu 1981.88 1985.15 s0001 IF YOU COUNTED FROM CAN MANAGE EVENING AS ZERO 
VL-kolkabsu 1985.15 1991.25 s0001 AND AS A RESULT I RISE TO HIS STATE OF FUNCTIONING MEMBER FUNCTION 
VL-kolkabsu 1991.25 1995.89 s0001 NOW OF COURSE IT'S A QUESTION IS HOW TO DEAL WAS THAT I MEAN 
VL-kolkabsu 1995.89 1999.74 s0001 THIS FUNCTION IS USED IN PRINCIPLE MEASURABLE 
VL-kolkabsu 1999.74 2003.71 s0001 IF I SEE IF ELASTIC NEWTON SCANDINAVIA CAN MEASURE 
VL-kolkabsu 2003.71 2007.53 s0001 EVERY FORM ONLINE OF ITS IF I CAN SEPARATE 
VL-kolkabsu 2007.53 2010.15 s0001 IN ELASTIC LAND IT'S FROM THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 2010.15 2016.47 s0001 A LINE IS IN USE BY HIS OTHER I MEASURE THAT THEY HAVE TO INTEGRATE TO DO A WHOLE RERUNS OF 
VL-kolkabsu 2016.47 2023.91 s0001 A LOT OF WORK NON HAS DONE IT BEFORE THE AND I DON'T THINK THAT SOMEBODY CAN DO IT 
VL-kolkabsu 2024.95 2026.40 s0001 AND 
VL-kolkabsu 2026.40 2030.02 s0001 BUT OF COURSE MOMENTS OF DYSFUNCTION THE FIRST MORMON 
VL-kolkabsu 2030.02 2031.98 s0001 YOU DON'T WANT LET'S SAY IT'S CALLED 
VL-kolkabsu 2031.98 2033.62 s0001 A COUPLE IN CONSTANT 
VL-kolkabsu 2033.62 2035.60 s0001 THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO MEASURE 
VL-kolkabsu 2037.51 2039.82 s0001 SO TO SUMMARISE 
VL-kolkabsu 2040.08 2042.02 s0001 THESE THEORY 
VL-kolkabsu 2042.02 2043.58 s0001 INTRODUCES 
VL-kolkabsu 2043.58 2048.90 s0001 SPECTRAL FUNCTION OF A LITTLE FORM INTERACTION OR ANY OTHER INTERACTION 
VL-kolkabsu 2048.90 2052.04 s0001 SHOULD ADJUST FREQUENCY DEPENDENT IT'S A BIT OUT OF THIS 
VL-kolkabsu 2052.04 2053.38 s0001 AND SECOND 
VL-kolkabsu 2053.38 2056.76 s0001 THERE IS A CALL TO THE POTENTIAL WHICH IS USED YOU DO 
VL-kolkabsu 2056.76 2058.35 s0001 OVATION 
VL-kolkabsu 2058.35 2059.98 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 2060.48 2062.20 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 2062.20 2063.73 s0001 WHAT IS IT 
VL-kolkabsu 2063.73 2066.69 s0001 ESSENTIAL INVASION THEORY IS THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 2066.69 2067.88 s0001 IF I 
VL-kolkabsu 2067.88 2070.02 s0001 SO ALL THE CREATION 
VL-kolkabsu 2070.02 2072.20 s0001 I WILL IMMEDIATELY REALISE THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 2072.20 2076.04 s0001 THERE IS NOT A CONSTANT IT'S A FUNCTION OF FREQUENCY 
VL-kolkabsu 2076.04 2079.37 s0001 IT MEANS OF EVE I DO FOR EXAMPLE 
VL-kolkabsu 2079.37 2084.77 s0001 A OPTICAL CONNECTIVITY MEASUREMENT OR A MORE A 
VL-kolkabsu 2084.77 2086.38 s0001 FINALLY THEY TURN 
VL-kolkabsu 2086.90 2093.47 s0001 DO CERTAINTY THAT IF MY CANDLES TO DO SIX I CAN SEE CIRCLES CROUCHING IN THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 2093.47 2095.32 s0001 AND A LOT OF 
VL-kolkabsu 2095.32 2102.86 s0001 PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN SUCH A SPECTROSCOPY SOLELY SEES A PEAK CINNAMON CANDLES PHYSICS USUALLY DO SECOND DERIVATIVE 
VL-kolkabsu 2102.86 2106.24 s0001 THEY COMPARED TO SOME MUTE INVADER 
VL-kolkabsu 2106.24 2110.41 s0001 OKAY I SEASON A FOURTEEN ELECTRON VOLTS PEAK IN VERY 
VL-kolkabsu 2110.41 2114.32 s0001 A HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING THAT MEANS THAT IT IS MAGNETIC 
VL-kolkabsu 2114.32 2115.48 s0001 INTERACTIONS 
VL-kolkabsu 2115.48 2118.10 s0001 THAT'S A TYPICAL A 
VL-kolkabsu 2118.10 2119.16 s0001 LETS ME 
VL-kolkabsu 2119.16 2120.23 s0001 STATEMENT OF 
VL-kolkabsu 2120.23 2121.76 s0001 SOME PAPERS 
VL-kolkabsu 2121.76 2123.05 s0001 AND THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 2123.05 2126.23 s0001 IN OUR LAB SUCCESS ANOTHER TECHNIQUE 
VL-kolkabsu 2127.05 2128.77 s0001 EACH 
VL-kolkabsu 2128.77 2132.55 s0001 A USES AIR BE UM 
VL-kolkabsu 2132.55 2134.01 s0001 AND AH 
VL-kolkabsu 2134.58 2136.28 s0001 OR A SHORT 
VL-kolkabsu 2136.28 2138.07 s0001 LASER PULSES 
VL-kolkabsu 2138.07 2143.37 s0001 YOU EXCITE A LITTLE HOLE THERE AND YOU CAN MONITOR CALLS IT LOOKS ISSUE A CAR 
VL-kolkabsu 2143.37 2146.16 s0001 WHEN YOU KNOW MONITORS AND WHAT'S ISSUE 
VL-kolkabsu 2146.16 2154.24 s0001 ACCESSION EASE NOTHING NAILS AND ANNEXATION INTO A FAMILY COULD YOU DISCUSS NORMAL STATE I DISCUSS ON THE NORMAL STATE 
VL-kolkabsu 2154.42 2157.99 s0001 SO YOU CAN DETERMINE WHAT STATION TIME 
VL-kolkabsu 2157.99 2163.54 s0001 YOU STILL EXHIBITION TIMES THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON THEIR INTERACTION AND THE SYSTEM THEREFORE 
VL-kolkabsu 2163.54 2164.83 s0001 WHY 
VL-kolkabsu 2164.83 2171.27 s0001 YOU KNOW CERTAIN ANALYSIS OF KINETIC EQUATIONS YOU CAN JUDGE ABOUT CERTAIN MOMENTS OF THE AIR 
VL-kolkabsu 2171.27 2174.72 s0001 YEAH BUT FUNCTION IN IN GENERAL THEY CAN MEASURE A 
VL-kolkabsu 2174.72 2178.41 s0001 NOW A KOSHER THE POTENTIAL 
VL-kolkabsu 2178.41 2182.84 s0001 NEVER DONE MUCH IN PRINCIPLE YES IF YOU CAN IS ALL THAT IF YOU CONCEIVE 
VL-kolkabsu 2182.84 2185.09 s0001 IT IS IN PRINCIPLE POSSIBLE 
VL-kolkabsu 2185.09 2186.80 s0001 NOW WHAT SHALL 
VL-kolkabsu 2186.80 2188.14 s0001 THE 
VL-kolkabsu 2188.14 2190.66 s0001 THIS STUFF WHICH WAS A 
VL-kolkabsu 2190.66 2192.52 s0001 NONE IN OUR LOVE AND 
VL-kolkabsu 2192.52 2194.31 s0001 MOSTLY WAY EAST OF 
VL-kolkabsu 2194.31 2196.09 s0001 NOW THAT MY AND THE 
VL-kolkabsu 2196.09 2197.55 s0001 IT WAS A SHAM 
VL-kolkabsu 2197.55 2198.82 s0001 MEASUREMENTS WAS NOT 
VL-kolkabsu 2198.82 2202.56 s0001 IN A OF MILAN ALSO 
VL-kolkabsu 2202.56 2206.06 s0001 A PARTIAL PARTIALLY IN OUR WORK 
VL-kolkabsu 2206.11 2207.64 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 2207.64 2216.73 s0001 JUST MEASURED ENOUGH ELECTRICIAN TIME IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU CAN DETERMINE A IDENTIFIES A PROCESS THAT YES IT IS AN INFORMED ELECTRICIAN 
VL-kolkabsu 2216.73 2217.81 s0001 HOW YOU DO IT 
VL-kolkabsu 2217.81 2227.59 s0001 CUSTOMERS THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE YOU HAVE TO MEASURE INTENSITY DEPENDENCE OF RELAXATION TIME AND USE AS A MORAL A SIMILAR VISIT LOOK PUNY PREDICTS YOU CAN AS HUMANS THEY ARE 
VL-kolkabsu 2227.59 2231.38 s0001 AND THAT'S A RESULT THAT'S FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING 
VL-kolkabsu 2231.38 2233.77 s0001 NOW IT IS BUT ONE 
VL-kolkabsu 2234.29 2236.02 s0001 ALSO A 
VL-kolkabsu 2236.02 2241.72 s0001 AH I TOOK THE DATA FROM A A IN OTHER PAPER WHICH IS NONE FOR ME THANKS 
VL-kolkabsu 2241.72 2244.21 s0001 AND FOR ME THAT'S FOR EXAMPLE NUMBER ARE 
VL-kolkabsu 2244.21 2245.47 s0001 HER 
VL-kolkabsu 2245.47 2247.38 s0001 SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER 
VL-kolkabsu 2248.73 2250.48 s0001 AND THE 
VL-kolkabsu 2250.48 2254.93 s0001 AH ACTUALLY YOU MEASURE NOT NOW HE WAS THE SECOND ONE 
VL-kolkabsu 2254.93 2256.02 s0001 OF THE 
VL-kolkabsu 2256.02 2257.63 s0001 YEAH FUNCTION 
VL-kolkabsu 2257.63 2259.14 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 2259.14 2261.13 s0001 NOW I'M ALMOST 
VL-kolkabsu 2263.12 2265.26 s0001 THAN RIGID OF 
VL-kolkabsu 2265.26 2267.21 s0001 DISCUSS THE LAST POINT OF 
VL-kolkabsu 2267.21 2271.78 s0001 MY TALK IS A SUPERCONDUCTING EIGHTY IS REPULSIVE FROM PRODUCTION 
VL-kolkabsu 2272.23 2276.25 s0001 SO AFTER WE SEE IF IT WAS

VL-kolkabsu 2294.81 2296.64 s0001 A VERY 
VL-kolkabsu 2296.64 2299.27 s0001 CAME TO THE PHYSICAL POSITION 
VL-kolkabsu 2299.27 2300.44 s0001 THE EVE 
VL-kolkabsu 2300.44 2301.93 s0001 YOU CAN SEE THAT 
VL-kolkabsu 2301.93 2304.00 s0001 THE PASTA FROM PRODUCTION 
VL-kolkabsu 2304.00 2305.61 s0001 WHICH IS 
VL-kolkabsu 2305.94 2307.90 s0001 THAT'S A SHORT RANGE 
VL-kolkabsu 2309.79 2311.19 s0001 WE CAN CARE FOR 
VL-kolkabsu 2311.19 2313.81 s0001 SUPERCOMPUTING SUPERCONDUCTING

VL-kolkabsu 2316.26 2317.73 s0001 JUST 
VL-kolkabsu 2318.03 2320.61 s0001 KEVIN SECTION REPULSION 
VL-kolkabsu 2320.61 2322.70 s0001 AND THE REASON IS VERY SIMPLE 
VL-kolkabsu 2322.70 2324.11 s0001 BECAUSE 
VL-kolkabsu 2324.17 2330.48 s0001 NOT ONLY HAVE REPULSION SECOND DIAGRAMS YOU HAVE A EXCHANGE 
VL-kolkabsu 2330.48 2331.52 s0001 IN THAT CASE 
VL-kolkabsu 2331.52 2333.61 s0001 AND EXCHANGE LINKS 
VL-kolkabsu 2333.61 2336.40 s0001 A SPATIAL DEPENDENCE OF THESE 
VL-kolkabsu 2336.64 2338.86 s0001 A INTERACTION

VL-kolkabsu 2341.50 2342.60 s0001 AH THIS 
VL-kolkabsu 2342.60 2344.27 s0001 FINALLY MOMENTUM 
VL-kolkabsu 2344.27 2345.72 s0001 YOU CAN HAVE 
VL-kolkabsu 2345.72 2347.42 s0001 ACTION 
VL-kolkabsu 2347.71 2356.00 s0001 AND THE OF COURSE ESTIMATES WAS NOT VERY PROMISING BECAUSE SIR ESTIMATES OF THE CRITICAL TEMPERATURE DON'T JUST AS A BASIS OF FAMILY UNIT 
VL-kolkabsu 2356.00 2357.65 s0001 AND YOU COULD NOT IN 
VL-kolkabsu 2357.65 2360.83 s0001 IN IT EXCEPT CHARGE OF ELECTRONICS AND THEN I 
VL-kolkabsu 2360.83 2361.88 s0001 THERE 
VL-kolkabsu 2361.88 2364.56 s0001 JEREMY ENERGY STEW PARAMETERS 
VL-kolkabsu 2364.56 2367.01 s0001 OLD NOTHING ELSE 
VL-kolkabsu 2367.01 2373.65 s0001 YOU CAN SO YOU CAN PRETTY WELL ESTIMATE CRITICAL TEMPERATURE AND IT APPEARS TO BE EXTENDED TO MINUS SEVEN GOVERN 
VL-kolkabsu 2373.65 2374.94 s0001 BUT 
VL-kolkabsu 2374.94 2376.09 s0001 THEN 
VL-kolkabsu 2376.09 2384.00 s0001 THEY MY VERY CAREFUL OR A STATEMENT THAT IN THE REAL SYSTEM WHEN THE FILM WAS SURFACES NOT STATIC NOW 
VL-kolkabsu 2384.00 2389.37 s0001 AND SO ON AND SO ON YOU MY YOU MIGHT SEE THEM CONSTANTLY SUBJECT 
VL-kolkabsu 2389.58 2391.57 s0001 THIS PAPER WAS 
VL-kolkabsu 2392.35 2393.76 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 2393.76 2395.17 s0001 WHAT 
VL-kolkabsu 2395.35 2398.39 s0001 I MEAN IT WAS A NORMAL 
VL-kolkabsu 2398.39 2400.88 s0001 NOBODY PAYS MUCH ATTENTION 
VL-kolkabsu 2400.88 2402.60 s0001 AH SO 
VL-kolkabsu 2402.60 2408.95 s0001 PROBABLY SOME PEOPLE USE THIS IS ALSO IN THE SUPER THREE DID YOU FEEL PITY BECAUSE IT'S ALSO PLAYED IN BUT 
VL-kolkabsu 2408.95 2412.95 s0001 SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THIS MECHANISM IS APPLICABLE TO THIS AH 
VL-kolkabsu 2412.95 2414.74 s0001 A SUPER FREEDOM 
VL-kolkabsu 2415.42 2417.65 s0001 SO WHAT CAN I SAY 
VL-kolkabsu 2417.65 2427.33 s0001 A ABOUT MATERIAL OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM SUPER CONNECTIVITY IS USUALLY DOES ALL THE PARAMETER IS A FUNCTION OF TO COORDINATE IF ELECTED 
VL-kolkabsu 2427.33 2431.77 s0001 YOU CAN WRITE IT IN TERMS OF CENTRAL MUST COORDINATE IN THE 
VL-kolkabsu 2431.77 2433.64 s0001 THAT RELATIVE COORDINATE 
VL-kolkabsu 2433.64 2437.35 s0001 SO SINCE YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR THEIR UNIFORM SOLUTION 
VL-kolkabsu 2437.35 2439.34 s0001 ABOUT HIS SENSE OF MUST YOU'VE 
VL-kolkabsu 2439.34 2440.57 s0001 AND 
VL-kolkabsu 2440.57 2441.79 s0001 I DON'T CARE 
VL-kolkabsu 2441.79 2447.54 s0001 HE'S A DIDN'T DEPENDENCE ON THE RELATIVE GOVERNMENT AND AS A FUNCTION OF THIS RELATIVE 
VL-kolkabsu 2447.54 2450.43 s0001 GROWING UP LIKE AN CABBAGE ANAPUM YOU CAN CARE 
VL-kolkabsu 2450.43 2451.79 s0001 A YOU KNOW 
VL-kolkabsu 2451.79 2454.90 s0001 OH PIERCES DIFFERENT ORBITAL LONDON 
VL-kolkabsu 2457.00 2460.08 s0001 SO FORMALLY IF I YEAH RIGHT 
VL-kolkabsu 2460.08 2464.72 s0001 THE THE THEORY I MEAN KNOWN THAT THE TYPICAL IN WHICH I DON'T 
VL-kolkabsu 2464.72 2467.51 s0001 I MEAN ADEQUATION FOR 
VL-kolkabsu 2467.76 2470.74 s0001 THESE YEARS GOT IT'S JUST DISINTEGRATION 
VL-kolkabsu 2470.74 2473.81 s0001 IT'S JUST A LITTLE INTO A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED FORM 
VL-kolkabsu 2473.81 2475.49 s0001 INCLUDING DISCOVERABLE 
VL-kolkabsu 2475.49 2477.88 s0001 THIS CAN ANALYZE US SOME OFF 
VL-kolkabsu 2477.88 2483.58 s0001 IRREDUCIBLE DIAGRAMS THAT MEANS OF ITEMS WHICH I CANNOT CUT MY LINE JUST CLOSE IN 
VL-kolkabsu 2483.58 2486.52 s0001 BUT JUST QUESTION TOO FEMININE LINES 
VL-kolkabsu 2486.64 2488.28 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 2488.28 2489.71 s0001 AND 
VL-kolkabsu 2489.71 2497.30 s0001 TO INVESTIGATE SUPERCONDUCTING DETECTIVE TO SO VERY SIMPLE EQUATION FOR OF I CAN BUT IT'S 
VL-kolkabsu 2497.30 2502.84 s0001 THESE AND MANY CHALLENGES SECRETION OF JUST I CAN RUN A SWITCH ANTENNAS A CUP AND CUSTOMS 
VL-kolkabsu 2503.28 2508.86 s0001 SO I'M YOU CAN SEE THAT IF I ASSUME THAT MY APOSTLE IS JUST FOR A 
VL-kolkabsu 2508.86 2510.35 s0001 MOMENTUM INDEPENDENT 
VL-kolkabsu 2510.35 2515.44 s0001 THESE TEABAG DEMS CANCELLED SO I LIVE ONLY HAS ONE IN PRISON IN OTHER 
VL-kolkabsu 2515.56 2520.77 s0001 AND THIS SECOND BAG AS A LOT OF ACADEMICS CHANGE THAT AND GIVES ME A SUPER CONNECTIVITY 
VL-kolkabsu 2520.77 2522.08 s0001 SO OFF 
VL-kolkabsu 2522.08 2526.14 s0001 STICK TO SPEAK AND IF I CAN SEE THE HARBOR MODEL 
VL-kolkabsu 2527.48 2530.38 s0001 T. D. IT IS SUPER CONDUCTOR 
VL-kolkabsu 2530.90 2534.50 s0001 SO ON IN THE CALCULATIONS ARE PRETTY SIMPLE 
VL-kolkabsu 2534.50 2538.47 s0001 BECAUSE SIMON INCOME FUNCTION IS LONG AND YOU HAVE TO JUST CALCULATED 
VL-kolkabsu 2538.47 2540.09 s0001 ONE INFINITE OWN 
VL-kolkabsu 2540.09 2541.98 s0001 IT IS DONE 
VL-kolkabsu 2542.46 2544.43 s0001 WHAT ISN'T 
VL-kolkabsu 2547.96 2553.98 s0001 INTERESTING IS THAT IF I ASSUME THAT I'M IN MY INTERACTION IS THE NORTH 
VL-kolkabsu 2553.98 2556.52 s0001 YOU ARE YOU KNOW POINT LIKE 
VL-kolkabsu 2556.52 2558.86 s0001 HE'S A SCREEN YOU CAN THE SYSTEM 
VL-kolkabsu 2558.86 2560.09 s0001 SO 
VL-kolkabsu 2560.09 2562.13 s0001 AH AND I CALCULATE 
VL-kolkabsu 2562.13 2564.01 s0001 WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND THAT I'LL HIT 
VL-kolkabsu 2564.01 2565.81 s0001 REGIONAL WINS 
VL-kolkabsu 2566.19 2569.13 s0001 A THREE DIMENSIONAL KEYS 
VL-kolkabsu 2569.13 2573.08 s0001 RESULT ANY ENCORE SINGLE ARTS AND SO ON SO 
VL-kolkabsu 2574.44 2575.91 s0001 AH 
VL-kolkabsu 2575.91 2580.82 s0001 THE SECOND POINT WHICH I WANT TO SAY IS THAT IF I CAN SEE THE TWO DIMENSIONAL KEYS 
VL-kolkabsu 2580.82 2583.60 s0001 THE DIMENSIONAL CASE IS NOT SUPERCONDUCTING 
VL-kolkabsu 2583.60 2584.73 s0001 BECAUSE
