VL-solwheim 1.04 3.00 s0001 I HOPE EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME I'M 
VL-solwheim 3.01 4.21 s0001 FREED UP FOR THE 
VL-solwheim 4.21 5.37 s0001 CAMERA I GUESS 
VL-solwheim 5.38 9.71 s0001 WELL IT'S ALL GOING TO INTRODUCE MYSELF VERY BRIEFLY UM I HAVE A YEAH 
VL-solwheim 9.72 11.43 s0001 A BACKGROUND IN EDUCATION 
VL-solwheim 11.44 14.32 s0001 AND I DID MY POSTGRADUATE WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ADMIRAL 
VL-solwheim 14.33 19.00 s0001 AND I DO A I N. ADAPTIVE DISEASE CONTROL SYSTEMS 
VL-solwheim 19.01 21.18 s0001 THE W. H. O. IN GENEVA 
VL-solwheim 21.18 24.42 s0001 AND I WORKED AT A. I. A. I. IN AND NUMBER UP 
VL-solwheim 24.42 28.26 s0001 AH I WAS RESEARCH MANAGER AT STAR LAB RESEARCH IN BRUSSELS 
VL-solwheim 28.27 30.97 s0001 AND AT PUBLIC VOICE LABS IN VIENNA AUSTRIA 
VL-solwheim 30.98 35.03 s0001 AND I WAS THE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXECUTIVE FOR THE SCHOOL OF INFORMATICS 
VL-solwheim 35.03 36.80 s0001 AGAIN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH 
VL-solwheim 36.81 41.91 s0001 AND I NOW HAVE A SMALL UH SAME TO THE CONSULTANCY CALLED A NUMBER OF SCIENTIFIC 
VL-solwheim 41.91 43.15 s0001 UM 
VL-solwheim 43.16 46.08 s0001 MY FOCUS WHAT I DO IS MOSTLY APPLIED A IKE 
VL-solwheim 46.08 49.92 s0001 SO DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH BUT BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING I'VE DONE 
VL-solwheim 49.93 51.11 s0001 APPLICATIONS 
VL-solwheim 51.12 55.12 s0001 AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PRESENTATION IS MOSTLY GOING TO BE ABOUT 
VL-solwheim 57.76 62.28 s0001 SO THIS PRESENTATION WILL BE ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES A MAYBE A LITTLE LESS 
VL-solwheim 62.28 64.55 s0001 FEEL FREE TO ASK QUESTIONS AT ANY TIME 
VL-solwheim 64.56 67.12 s0001 UM I'M GOING TO BE DESCRIBING SOME OF THE BASIC 
VL-solwheim 67.12 70.32 s0001 CONCEPTS IN RESEARCH IN ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS 
VL-solwheim 70.33 72.83 s0001 AND I'M SURE SOME APPLIED EXAMPLES 
VL-solwheim 72.84 77.63 s0001 A SPECIFICALLY ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS FOR APPLIED KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING 
VL-solwheim 77.64 80.97 s0001 SO HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BIOLOGICAL METAPHORS IN A I'VE 
VL-solwheim 80.97 83.47 s0001 AS OPPOSED TO BIOLOGICAL MODELLING WHICH 
VL-solwheim 83.48 85.32 s0001 IS IT SO NOVEL FIELD OF COURSE 
VL-solwheim 85.33 87.87 s0001 THE END OF THIS PRESENTATION IS FOR GENERAL 
VL-solwheim 87.88 89.68 s0001 SCIENTIFIC AUDIENCE 
VL-solwheim 90.19 93.39 s0001 UM SO YOU SEE HERE THAT WE HAVE A 
VL-solwheim 93.40 97.99 s0001 I KIND OF GRAPHIC OF WHERE A ICONS AND IT'S A VERY BIG FIELD OBVIOUSLY 
VL-solwheim 98.00 103.04 s0001 AND UM A I COMBINING AGAIN WITH BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE 
VL-solwheim 103.04 105.23 s0001 OVER ON THE NON SYMBOLIC SIDE 
VL-solwheim 105.24 109.63 s0001 AH YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE GENETIC ALGORITHMS AND NEURAL NETWORKS IN IN THE MIDDLE MAYBE 
VL-solwheim 109.64 111.42 s0001 SOMEWHERE IS ARTIFICIAL 
VL-solwheim 111.43 113.03 s0001 IMMUNE SYSTEMS 
VL-solwheim 113.44 119.58 s0001 ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE AS HERE IN EMERGING PARADIGM FOR COMPUTATION AND MACHINE LEARNING BASED ON 
VL-solwheim 119.58 121.82 s0001 BIOLOGICAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS 
VL-solwheim 122.87 131.15 s0001 SO I'M GOING TO PRESENT VERY BRIEFLY A COUPLE SLIDES ABOUT HUMAN IMMUNOLOGY AND SO WHAT PARTS OF THE METAPHOR WE'RE TAKING AWAY FROM ITS 
VL-solwheim 131.16 134.63 s0001 AND SO THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM IS A HIGHLY 
VL-solwheim 134.65 138.32 s0001 COMPLEX MASSIVELY PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 138.33 140.33 s0001 THAT MAINTAINS BOTH INMATE 
VL-solwheim 140.34 142.43 s0001 OF THE YOU KNOW THAT THE UNION INDEED 
VL-solwheim 142.43 146.21 s0001 YEAH IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE BORN WITH WHICH IS THESE NON SPECIFIC 
VL-solwheim 146.21 148.86 s0001 AND ACQUIRED DEFENCES SO 
VL-solwheim 148.87 151.33 s0001 THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE GETTING FROM YOUR ENVIRONMENTS 
VL-solwheim 151.34 154.11 s0001 AND THE THIS SYSTEM IS THEREFORE 
VL-solwheim 154.12 155.88 s0001 THE DEFENCE 
VL-solwheim 155.88 160.07 s0001 AND FOR SELF AND NON SELF DISCRIMINATION SO YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IS 
VL-solwheim 160.07 163.03 s0001 WANDERING AROUND LOOKING FOR THINGS THAT ARE NOT YOU 
VL-solwheim 163.04 164.64 s0001 BUT IT CAN TRY TO KILL 
VL-solwheim 164.69 168.71 s0001 UM SO THERE ARE CELLULAR BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 168.72 174.25 s0001 A OLYMPUS SITES AGNES SITES STANDS WITHIN THEM FOR SITES THERE BE CELLS AND T. CELLS 
VL-solwheim 174.25 178.90 s0001 THEY'RE CREATED IN THE FAVELA SIMPLE MARROW AND THE INTERACTIVE ANTIGENS 
VL-solwheim 178.90 182.92 s0001 ANTIGENS OR ANYTHING THAT ARE PERCEIVED AS BEING FOREIGN TO THE BODY 
VL-solwheim 182.93 184.17 s0001 UM 
VL-solwheim 184.18 187.17 s0001 ANSWER RECOGNITION CAUSE AN IMMUNE RESPONSE 
VL-solwheim 187.17 192.66 s0001 SO THE INDY CELLS HAVE AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND RECEPTORS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH INFORMATION 
VL-solwheim 192.67 195.75 s0001 ROUGHLY THEY ARE PREPARED TO STORE 
VL-solwheim 195.76 197.84 s0001 AND USE IN THEIR MATCHING PROCESS 
VL-solwheim 197.85 200.76 s0001 AND THERE'S ABOUT TEN TO THE TWELFTH OF THESE 
VL-solwheim 200.77 202.27 s0001 IN THE HUMAN BODY 
VL-solwheim 204.02 206.47 s0001 A LITTLE MORE SIMPLE IMMUNOLOGY 
VL-solwheim 206.48 213.32 s0001 AN IMMUNE RESPONSE INCLUDES THE CLONING OF ACTIVITY BE CELLS WITH SOME IDENTICAL AND SOME SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT OFFSPRING 
VL-solwheim 213.33 219.40 s0001 ANTIBODIES RECOGNIZE DANGEROUS ANTIGENS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT THROUGH COMPLEX MATCHING 
VL-solwheim 219.40 222.54 s0001 AN INTERACTION PROCESS IN THEIR BINDING REGIONS 
VL-solwheim 222.91 228.20 s0001 I ONCE A FOREIGN ANTIGEN IS RECOGNISED IMMUNOLOGICAL MEMORY IS CREATED 
VL-solwheim 228.20 230.14 s0001 AND THIS IS THE BASIS FOR MODERN 
VL-solwheim 230.15 231.55 s0001 VACCINATION 
VL-solwheim 231.88 236.76 s0001 SO WHEN YOU INTRODUCE A NEW ANTIGEN INTO THE HUMAN BODY 
VL-solwheim 236.76 239.82 s0001 AH THERE WILL BE RESPONSE IN THE RESPONSE WILL BE 
VL-solwheim 239.83 242.27 s0001 IN SOME WAYS OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE THREAT 
VL-solwheim 242.27 245.19 s0001 AND THAT IS WHERE VACCINATION COMES FROM 
VL-solwheim 245.19 248.31 s0001 THE KEY CONCEPTS ARE TAKING AWAY HERE FROM FROM 
VL-solwheim 248.32 251.98 s0001 HUMAN IMMUNOLOGY AND ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE THINGS LIKE MATCHING 
VL-solwheim 252.00 253.35 s0001 CLONING 
VL-solwheim 253.36 254.68 s0001 MORPHOLOGY 
VL-solwheim 254.68 257.60 s0001 NEGATIVE SELECTION AND SELF NON SELF 
VL-solwheim 257.61 259.00 s0001 DISCRIMINATION 
VL-solwheim 260.31 262.77 s0001 SO WHAT ARE ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS 
VL-solwheim 262.77 263.84 s0001 UM 
VL-solwheim 263.85 267.16 s0001 ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE VERY YOUNG SUB FIELD IN A I 
VL-solwheim 267.17 269.13 s0001 THEY TEND TO BE SOFTWARE BASED 
VL-solwheim 269.13 274.11 s0001 BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED AND OFTEN APPLIED INTRACTABLE FAULT DETECTION PROBLEMS 
VL-solwheim 274.11 276.50 s0001 SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT CLASSIFIERS SYSTEMS 
VL-solwheim 276.51 278.40 s0001 AH YOU MIGHT HAVE A 
VL-solwheim 278.42 280.73 s0001 YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD EXAMPLES OF A PARTICULAR CLASS 
VL-solwheim 280.74 284.12 s0001 EXAMPLES OF ANOTHER CLASS YOU WANT TO TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO 
VL-solwheim 284.13 287.61 s0001 AN ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM YOU VERY ONLY HAVE THE FIRST CLASS 
VL-solwheim 287.61 292.69 s0001 YOU LEARN WHAT IS NORMAL THERE IS NO SECOND CLASS EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT IN THE FIRST CLASS 
VL-solwheim 292.70 295.72 s0001 IS GOING TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN SOME WAY 
VL-solwheim 295.74 297.70 s0001 UM WHAT ARE THEY GOOD FOR 
VL-solwheim 297.70 300.15 s0001 THINGS LIKE A LOT ANOMALY DETECTION IN 
VL-solwheim 300.17 305.23 s0001 COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING YOU NEED A LOT OF ONGOING LEARNING 
VL-solwheim 305.23 308.54 s0001 A PHYSICAL AND NETWORK SECURITY APPLICATIONS 
VL-solwheim 308.55 311.62 s0001 EVOLUTIONARY IN DISTRIBUTED INFORMATION PROCESSING 
VL-solwheim 311.63 314.52 s0001 SCHEDULING AND PLANNING CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION 
VL-solwheim 314.52 317.26 s0001 MODELLING AND DESIGN OPTIMIZATION 
VL-solwheim 317.27 318.84 s0001 HOW DO THEY WORK 
VL-solwheim 318.85 322.59 s0001 UM AGAIN TAKING THE METAPHOR FROM THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 322.60 325.96 s0001 START WITH AN ENVIRONMENT IN YOU GENERATE ANTIBODIES 
VL-solwheim 325.95 328.62 s0001 AND THE ANTIBODIES MIGHT ALSO BE 
VL-solwheim 328.63 332.03 s0001 UH FROM A TEST SETS AND I WILL SHOW AN EXAMPLE HERE A MOMENT 
VL-solwheim 332.03 336.10 s0001 AND THESE THESE ANTIBODIES THAT CAME FROM THE 
VL-solwheim 336.12 338.51 s0001 FROM THE THE ORIGINAL SAT 
VL-solwheim 338.51 341.40 s0001 A TRAINING CENTER THE ENVIRONMENT CALLED THE SELF 
VL-solwheim 341.40 345.91 s0001 OTHERS AND AND AND INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ANTIBODIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT 
VL-solwheim 345.93 349.13 s0001 THERE'S A KIND OF IMMUNE RESPONSE IF THERE'S MATCHING 
VL-solwheim 349.14 352.79 s0001 AH AND THEN THERE'S A PROCESS OF CLONING OR REPRODUCTION 
VL-solwheim 352.80 354.50 s0001 AND THIS GOES BACK IN THE LOOP 
VL-solwheim 354.51 357.51 s0001 SO YOU START OUT WITH INNATE IMMUNITY THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT 
VL-solwheim 357.51 358.96 s0001 BUT YOU NOR NORMAL 
VL-solwheim 358.96 365.28 s0001 AND YOU YOU MOVE ON TOWARDS ACQUIRED IMMUNITY ACQUIRED IMMUNITY IS WHERE THE SYSTEM HAS LEARNS TO BE HYPER VIGILANT 
VL-solwheim 365.29 369.00 s0001 FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF THINGS IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS LOOKING FOR 
VL-solwheim 369.01 371.81 s0001 AND I WILL GIVE SOME SIMPLY EXAMPLES IN A MOMENT 
VL-solwheim 372.87 374.33 s0001 HOW DO YOU BUILD THEM 
VL-solwheim 374.33 375.79 s0001 UM 
VL-solwheim 376.16 378.52 s0001 OKAY THAT'S NOT RIGHT YES 
VL-solwheim 378.53 381.44 s0001 LIKE MANY A. I. SYSTEMS A 
VL-solwheim 381.45 385.34 s0001 ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE TAKING FOR LEARNING IN REACTING TO AN ENVIRONMENT 
VL-solwheim 385.35 389.24 s0001 OTHERS A CYCLE OF OBSERVATION TRAINING MONITORING 
VL-solwheim 389.25 390.67 s0001 AND RESPONSE 
VL-solwheim 390.69 393.55 s0001 SO YOU CHOOSE AN ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING 
VL-solwheim 393.71 397.33 s0001 HERE FOR EXAMPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE ANIMALS IN A ZOO 
VL-solwheim 397.33 402.25 s0001 SO WHY THERE'S A FAMOUS MACHINE LEARNING SET YOU TRY TO LEARN WHAT ANIMALS ARE WHICH 
VL-solwheim 402.25 404.69 s0001 A FROM A ZOO DATABASE 
VL-solwheim 405.25 409.53 s0001 AND YOU INTERFACE THIS DATA TO AN ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 409.54 413.58 s0001 HERE I'M USING AN ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT'S PART OF THE SHELL 
VL-solwheim 413.59 414.97 s0001 SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 415.63 417.56 s0001 AND UH SELF MEMORY 
VL-solwheim 417.57 420.90 s0001 CAN BE CREATED AUTOMATICALLY TO TEST THE DATA 
VL-solwheim 420.91 424.34 s0001 I'M SORRY THAT THIS IS ALL MARBLE THAT NEVER SEEN IT THIS WAY 
VL-solwheim 425.04 429.33 s0001 AND FINALLY ANTIBODY PROFILES ARE AUTOMATICALLY CREATED 
VL-solwheim 429.34 434.46 s0001 OKAY SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS THERE'S A ZOO DATABASE AND IT HAS ANIMALS AND IT HAS THESE VALUES 
VL-solwheim 434.47 439.44 s0001 SO UM YOU KNOW DOES THE ANIMAL HAVE HAIR DOESN'T HAVE FEATHERS DOES IT LAY AGNES 
VL-solwheim 439.45 443.68 s0001 AND ALL THIS STUFF GOES INTO A DATABASE AND THEN ANTIBODIES ARE CREATED 
VL-solwheim 443.69 447.65 s0001 THAT MAY OR MAY NET MAY OR MAY NOT MATCH THE EXAMPLES IN IT 
VL-solwheim 447.66 448.71 s0001 YOU NEED THAT 
VL-solwheim 448.72 450.12 s0001 TRAINING SET 
VL-solwheim 450.74 453.66 s0001 UH SO HERE I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT 
VL-solwheim 453.67 460.12 s0001 ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS AND SEMI ON SUPERVISED CLASSIFIERS THING NEED NO NEGATIVE EXAMPLES IN SOME WAYS 
VL-solwheim 460.12 462.27 s0001 I WOULD CONTINUOUS LEARNING 
VL-solwheim 462.42 467.28 s0001 AND ANTIBODIES ARE CREATED RANDOM OR USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM 
VL-solwheim 468.66 471.40 s0001 ANTIBODIES TO CLOSELY MATCHING THE SELF 
VL-solwheim 471.41 473.75 s0001 A FOUR OR THE NORMAL STATE 
VL-solwheim 473.76 477.72 s0001 ARE KILLED OFF DURING TRAINING SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAD A ZOO DATABASE 
VL-solwheim 477.73 479.18 s0001 YOU HAD A ZEBRA 
VL-solwheim 479.18 485.43 s0001 A ANY ANTI BODY THAT WAS CREATED ORIGINALLY THAT CAN CLOSELY MATCHES A ZEBRA IN DESCRIPTION 
VL-solwheim 485.44 486.62 s0001 WILL BE REMOVED 
VL-solwheim 486.63 490.78 s0001 SO THE ONLY ANTIBODIES THAT ARE GOING TO REMAIN IN OUR DATABASE ARE THOSE 
VL-solwheim 490.79 492.20 s0001 DO NOT MATCH 
VL-solwheim 492.20 493.82 s0001 AN ANIMAL IN THE ZOO 
VL-solwheim 494.31 496.11 s0001 BUT 
VL-solwheim 497.82 499.21 s0001 EXACTLY 
VL-solwheim 499.22 503.21 s0001 YEAH AND SO WHAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING AND I HAVE SOME GOOD UH GRAPHICS LATER 
VL-solwheim 503.21 507.98 s0001 IS IT IS YOU ARE POPULATE IN THE STATE SPACE AROUND GOOD SOLUTIONS 
VL-solwheim 507.99 510.59 s0001 BUT DURING THE MONITORING FACE 
VL-solwheim 510.59 511.72 s0001 AND 
VL-solwheim 511.74 514.59 s0001 THAT REPRESENTED HERE AS ANTIGENS 
VL-solwheim 514.60 516.56 s0001 SO VIA THIS SELF 
VL-solwheim 516.55 519.23 s0001 AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE COMPARED 
VL-solwheim 519.25 522.94 s0001 IT'S OUR MATCHES WE KNOW THAT IT'S PROBABLY OUTSIDE OF AS YOU SAY THE 
VL-solwheim 522.95 525.30 s0001 THE STATE SPACE OF GOOD SOLUTIONS 
VL-solwheim 525.86 529.97 s0001 AND ACCORDING TO IMMUNOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES AN IMMUNE RESPONSE MAKER 
VL-solwheim 530.66 532.71 s0001 SO HOW DO THEY REACT 
VL-solwheim 537.11 542.34 s0001 SO UM I WOULD THAT THIS SLIDE IS ALL ABOUT WHAT AN IMMUNE AN ENEMY RESPONSE WILL BE 
VL-solwheim 542.35 546.94 s0001 BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING WHAT IT DOES IS SO IF YOU TAKE THE STATE SPACE METAPHOR WHEN IT FINDS 
VL-solwheim 546.95 548.98 s0001 SOMETHING THAT IT KNOWS IS NOT THE SELF 
VL-solwheim 548.99 554.37 s0001 IT WILL DO CLONING OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF A AROUND THAT AREA OF THE STATE SPACE 
VL-solwheim 554.37 558.86 s0001 AS PART OF ITS LEARNING PROCESS AND I HAVE A GOOD EXAMPLE HERE IN A MOMENT 
VL-solwheim 559.15 560.89 s0001 SO 
VL-solwheim 567.83 572.53 s0001 UH SO COMPARING THE SELF TO THE ENVIRONMENT MAY TRIGGER AN IMMUNE RESPONSE 
VL-solwheim 572.54 579.03 s0001 AND AH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM DEPENDING ON ON WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING HERE IN SAN APPLIED SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 579.04 584.24 s0001 UH SO IT MAY STORM WARNING CONTACT AN ADMINISTRATOR OR REACT AUTOMATICALLY 
VL-solwheim 584.36 587.16 s0001 AND THE IMMUNE RESPONSE MAY ALSO 
VL-solwheim 587.16 597.03 s0001 A INCLUDE A GENERATION OR NETWORK DISSEMINATION OF ADVANCED ANTI BODIES ARE CLONES WOULD EVEN BETTER DETECTION SKILLS ARE PROVIDING ACQUIRED 
VL-solwheim 597.04 598.16 s0001 COMMUNITY 
VL-solwheim 598.16 601.34 s0001 AGAIN I'M SORRY ABOUT THESE TITLES I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT 
VL-solwheim 601.36 603.02 s0001 THE PROBLEM IS 
VL-solwheim 604.32 606.65 s0001 SO HERE ARE SOME OF THE BASICS 
VL-solwheim 606.65 608.07 s0001 REPRESENTATION 
VL-solwheim 608.09 611.66 s0001 A I S. SYSTEMS IN SOFTWARE USUALLY BUILT LIKE THIS 
VL-solwheim 611.66 615.66 s0001 YOU DECIDE UPON A REPRESENTATION OF THE PROBLEM DOMAIN 
VL-solwheim 615.67 618.05 s0001 EITHER DIRECT BINARY SYMBOLIC FUZZY 
VL-solwheim 618.05 619.59 s0001 SOLUTION RANGES 
VL-solwheim 619.60 623.44 s0001 AND THEN YOU ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION STANDARDS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT MONITORED 
VL-solwheim 623.45 625.87 s0001 ALL EXAMPLES IN THIS PRESENTATION ARE TAKEN 
VL-solwheim 625.88 628.39 s0001 FROM A SHELL SYSTEM THAT'S THAT I BUILT 
VL-solwheim 628.39 631.60 s0001 YOU'RE STARTING WITH THE DATABASE OF ANIMALS IN THE ZOO AS BEFORE 
VL-solwheim 631.61 635.52 s0001 THE QUESTION IS HAVING TRAINS AN ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM ON THE ANIMALS IN A ZOO 
VL-solwheim 635.52 637.22 s0001 HOW DO WE PROTECT THEM 
VL-solwheim 637.22 641.12 s0001 OF WHEN WE'RE INTRODUCING NEW AND UNKNOWN ANIMALS SO WE'RE USING THIS 
VL-solwheim 641.13 643.24 s0001 AS METAPHOR OF ANIMALS IN A ZOO 
VL-solwheim 643.25 646.33 s0001 TO TRY TO LOOK INTO THE LOGIC OF HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS 
VL-solwheim 647.71 651.81 s0001 SO WE START BY CREATING IN IN AN INITIAL POPULATION OF ANYBODY'S 
VL-solwheim 651.80 655.53 s0001 EITHER RANDOMLY OR USING STATISTICAL ORGY A METHODS 
VL-solwheim 655.54 658.91 s0001 AND REMOVE ANTIBODIES THAT TOO CLOSELY MATCH THE SELF 
VL-solwheim 658.92 659.95 s0001 WHICH IS HERE 
VL-solwheim 659.97 661.52 s0001 ANIMALS IN THE ZOO 
VL-solwheim 662.29 665.07 s0001 ANTIBODIES FORM THE COLLECTIVE MEMORY 
VL-solwheim 665.08 667.51 s0001 OF NATURAL INTERACTION WITH THE SELF 
VL-solwheim 667.52 671.06 s0001 AUTO IMMUNITY WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT HERE 
VL-solwheim 671.07 675.67 s0001 IS THE FAILURE OF AN ORGANISM TO RECOGNISE ITS OWN CONSTITUENT PARTS AS ITSELF 
VL-solwheim 675.67 679.52 s0001 WHICH ALLOWS AN AMUSING IMMUNE RESPONSE AGAINST ITS OWN SELVES 
VL-solwheim 679.52 686.35 s0001 SO IF WE WERE NOT REMOVING ANTI BODIES THAT WERE MATCHING THE DATA THAT WE'RE STARTING WITH YOU WOULD GET THIS AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE 
VL-solwheim 686.36 689.78 s0001 WHERE IT WAS SEEING ALREADY ANIMALS IN THE ZOO AS BEING 
VL-solwheim 689.79 691.18 s0001 INCORRECT 
VL-solwheim 692.79 695.65 s0001 SO THESE ARE THE BASICS OF LEARNING IN MATCHING 
VL-solwheim 695.66 698.08 s0001 SO WE START BY MONITORING THE ENVIRONMENT 
VL-solwheim 698.08 704.77 s0001 WHICH IS CREATING DATA SAMPLES FOR LEARNING IN THIS CASE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE CYCLING ANIMALS TOO BUSY DATABASE 
VL-solwheim 704.78 709.28 s0001 REMOVING ANY ANTIBODIES WHICH MATCH THE ENVIRONMENT SAMPLES TOO CLOSELY 
VL-solwheim 709.40 715.04 s0001 AS ANOTHER MACHINE LEARNING METHODS WERE LOOKING FOR THE SMALLEST COLLECTION OF CLASSIFIERS OR ANTIBODIES 
VL-solwheim 715.05 717.82 s0001 WHICH ABSTRACT THE SYSTEMS KNOWLEDGE OR LOGIC 
VL-solwheim 717.83 720.98 s0001 IN A I ASK TOO MANY ANTIBODIES EQUALS OVER FITTING 
VL-solwheim 720.98 727.11 s0001 SO IF YOU IMAGINE THE STATE SPACE IF YOU'RE OVER FITTING WITH ANTIBODIES YOU'RE CREATING A BIG BUBBLE AROUND THE DATA 
VL-solwheim 727.12 729.53 s0001 EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT AN IT IS NOT US 
VL-solwheim 729.54 731.63 s0001 IT IS NOT A VERY ROBUST WAY OF 
VL-solwheim 731.63 734.72 s0001 INTERACTING WITH THE WORLD IF YOU HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES 
VL-solwheim 734.72 736.38 s0001 SO HERE YOU HAVE AN ELK 
VL-solwheim 736.39 739.41 s0001 THEY WENT THROUGH THE DATABASE OF ANTIBODIES THAT WERE GENERATED 
VL-solwheim 739.42 742.45 s0001 AND IT REMOVED ANY THAT WERE MATCHING IT TOO CLOSELY 
VL-solwheim 742.47 748.18 s0001 SO THIS DATABASE ENVIRONMENTAL KNOWLEDGE IS THE IT'S IN ME IMMUNITY 
VL-solwheim 749.79 753.40 s0001 GOING OVER TO MONITORING C. TRAIN TO THE SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 753.44 757.88 s0001 UM YOU'RE MONITORING ALIVE ENVIRONMENT HERE WE'RE INTRODUCING NEW ANIMALS 
VL-solwheim 757.88 764.77 s0001 SO YOU'RE YOU'RE ALLOWING THE REMAINING ANTIBODIES TO BEGIN MONITORING THEIR ENVIRONMENT IN GENERATING AN IMMUNE RESPONSE 
VL-solwheim 764.77 767.26 s0001 WHEN THEY TOO CLOSELY MATCH THE ENVIRONMENT SO 
VL-solwheim 767.26 773.88 s0001 SO WE KNOW THAT UH ZEBRAS PROBABLY OKAY THE FISH IS O. K. D. L. P.S OKAY BUT THIS THIS ONE HERE WHICH I THINK IS LIKE A 
VL-solwheim 773.89 775.24 s0001 PERCENT OR MAYBE 
VL-solwheim 775.25 778.65 s0001 IF YOU TRY THIS WITH THE SHELL SYSTEM IT WILL IDENTIFY THIS 
VL-solwheim 778.66 780.85 s0001 AS BEING NOT CORRECT 
VL-solwheim 780.86 783.68 s0001 THAT IS BECAUSE IT HAS ABSTRACTED THE LOGIC 
VL-solwheim 783.69 786.84 s0001 OF HOW ANIMALS IN A ZOO WHAT THEY ARE 
VL-solwheim 786.84 789.08 s0001 HIS ABSTRACT A LOT OF THAT LOGIC 
VL-solwheim 789.08 793.18 s0001 AND IT WILL FLAG THAT UP AND SAY THIS IS NOT CORRECT DOES NOT BELONG IN A ZOO 
VL-solwheim 793.86 798.87 s0001 SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT HAVING FOUND THIS ANIMAL THAT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE ZOO 
VL-solwheim 798.87 805.34 s0001 UM WE CREATE CLONES AND MUTATIONS OF THE ANTIBODIES WHICH CAUSED AN IMMUNE RESPONSE 
VL-solwheim 805.34 807.95 s0001 AND DISTRIBUTE THEM THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 807.96 811.49 s0001 AND WE ALSO CREATE OCCASIONAL RANDOM NEW ANTIBODIES 
VL-solwheim 811.50 813.85 s0001 AND INTRODUCE THEM INTO THE POPULATION 
VL-solwheim 813.85 815.05 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-solwheim 815.06 817.14 s0001 WE KNOW THAT THIS THING WAS NOT CORRECT 
VL-solwheim 817.15 822.69 s0001 SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE MIGHT BE WARNING THE USER WE MIGHT BE LOGGING WARNINGS BUT FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT PART 
VL-solwheim 822.70 826.34 s0001 IS DOWN HERE WE'RE CREATING A LOT OF THINGS SIMILAR TO THIS 
VL-solwheim 826.35 828.05 s0001 TO POPULATE THIS 
VL-solwheim 828.06 829.85 s0001 PART OF THE STATE SPACE 
VL-solwheim 829.86 832.07 s0001 TO BE HYPER VIGILANCE 
VL-solwheim 832.43 833.23 s0001 GEORGIA 
VL-solwheim 833.24 835.74 s0024 READING SOME CLONES PROBABLY USING SOME 
VL-solwheim 835.74 837.03 s0001 GENETIC METAPHORS 
VL-solwheim 837.04 842.11 s0001 AND THEY GO BACK INTO THE INTO THE DATABASE AND THEY MIGHT ALSO BE DISTRIBUTED REMOTELY 
VL-solwheim 842.11 844.49 s0001 TWO OTHER SYSTEMS THAT WERE MINOR 
VL-solwheim 844.49 845.31 s0024 THREE 
VL-solwheim 846.83 848.57 s0024 UM 
VL-solwheim 850.51 852.25 s0024 WAS NOT EITHER 
VL-solwheim 854.33 856.07 s0024 YES 
VL-solwheim 857.71 859.65 s0001 NO I I'M SORRY THIS IS IT 
VL-solwheim 859.65 865.66 s0001 THIS IS A BIT CONFUSING HERE BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY DATABASE OF OF ANTIBODIES IN NOT THE ORIGINAL TESTS AT 
VL-solwheim 865.66 868.11 s0001 THE ORIGINAL TACIT HAS BEEN REMOVED 
VL-solwheim 868.11 873.67 s0001 AH THE GRAPHIC THAT'S UNDER THE DATABASES THERE BE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE SHELL SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 873.68 876.79 s0001 WORKS IT HAD THE DATA APPEARED IN THE SAME WINDOW 
VL-solwheim 881.33 886.18 s0001 YES YES SO NOW WE HAVE POPULATED THE STATE SPACE WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS 
VL-solwheim 886.18 891.02 s0001 AND THE QUESTION NOW IS THIS CHARACTER I THINK IS A CYCLE OPS 
VL-solwheim 891.02 896.23 s0001 WILL HE BE MORE LIKELY TO BE DETECTED AS NOT BELONGING IN THE ZOO 
VL-solwheim 896.24 897.92 s0001 AND THE ANSWER SHOULD BE YES 
VL-solwheim 897.93 901.14 s0001 UM YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER TO THAT IT'S NOT JUST A SINGLE 
VL-solwheim 901.15 903.34 s0001 ANTIBODY THAT MIGHT BE MATCHING 
VL-solwheim 903.35 904.39 s0001 THIS CHARACTER 
VL-solwheim 904.40 908.60 s0001 IT MIGHT BE OF A COLLECTION OF MIGHT BE PULLING SYSTEM WITH HUNDREDS THAT ARE MATCHING 
VL-solwheim 908.61 910.29 s0001 DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF 
VL-solwheim 910.30 911.45 s0001 THAT CHARACTER 
VL-solwheim 911.46 914.47 s0001 UM SO THE MORE THERE ARE THE MORE UM 
VL-solwheim 914.48 917.68 s0001 THAT THAT IS MORE ANTIBODIES THE MATCH EIGHT A PARTICULAR AH 
VL-solwheim 917.69 918.78 s0001 ANTIGEN 
VL-solwheim 918.78 922.52 s0001 THE MORE CONFIDENCE THE SYSTEM HAS THAT WHAT IT HAS ITS 
VL-solwheim 922.52 924.93 s0001 WHAT IT IS SEEN WHAT IT IS DOING IS CORRECT 
VL-solwheim 924.93 929.05 s0001 SO THE QUESTION IS THE SYSTEM NOW BETTER ABLE HAVING SEEN THIS ONE 
VL-solwheim 929.06 931.85 s0001 TO DETECT THIS ONE IN THE ANSWER SHOULD BE YES 
VL-solwheim 931.86 935.86 s0001 SO MAYBE IT WOULD NOT DETECT THIS ONE BEFORE I WOULD ACTUALLY 
VL-solwheim 935.87 940.82 s0001 AH BUT NOW WE KNOW WHAT WELL IT WILL WITH A LOT OF STRENGTH BECAUSE IT'S BEGINNING TO ABSTRACT 
VL-solwheim 940.83 944.78 s0001 AH SOME OF THE LOGIC FOR WHERE IT IS GOING TO BE SEEING 
VL-solwheim 944.78 946.38 s0001 A DEVIATIONS FROM 
VL-solwheim 946.39 947.43 s0001 THE DATABASE 
VL-solwheim 947.44 949.14 s0001 BECAUSE OF A VERY VERY SIMPLE 
VL-solwheim 949.15 952.01 s0001 EXPLANATION OF THE KIND OF THINGS THAT ARE DOING 
VL-solwheim 952.37 954.12 s0001 BUT THEN 
VL-solwheim 961.52 964.16 s0001 NOT NOT NOT ABSOLUTELY 
VL-solwheim 964.16 967.27 s0001 IT IS IN THIS CASE BECAUSE IT IS AN ILLUSTRATION 
VL-solwheim 967.27 970.26 s0001 UM BUT BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO SHOW HERE IS THAT 
VL-solwheim 970.27 972.56 s0001 IS THAT THE SYSTEM WILL WILL LEARN 
VL-solwheim 972.57 976.24 s0001 AH YOU KNOW WE WILL DO NEGATIVE SELECTION IN AN ONGOING WAY 
VL-solwheim 976.25 980.07 s0001 THEN IT WILL INCREASE ITS INDIVIDUAL AND SAYS IT GOES ON 
VL-solwheim 980.07 983.56 s0001 SO IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY SIMPLE ILLUSTRATED EXAMPLE 
VL-solwheim 987.69 991.26 s0001 YES YOU KNOW YOU ALSO DON'T NEED TO START WITH AN INITIAL 
VL-solwheim 991.27 992.49 s0001 A EXCLUSION SET 
VL-solwheim 992.50 996.26 s0001 SO YOU CAN START WITH A KIND OF ONE CLASS CLASSIFIERS SOMEPLACE 
VL-solwheim 996.26 1001.11 s0001 AH I THINK IT WILL BECOME A LITTLE CLEARER WHEN I SHOW SOME SOME MORE REAL WORLD EXAMPLES 
VL-solwheim 1001.97 1003.40 s0001 AH 
VL-solwheim 1003.40 1006.37 s0001 YOU KNOW JUST TO FINISH NEW ZOO DATABASE METAPHOR 
VL-solwheim 1006.37 1009.60 s0001 YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE SYSTEM SEE SOMETHING LIKE 
VL-solwheim 1009.60 1014.19 s0001 THIS THIS CHARACTER ON THE LEFT YOU KNOW SOWS AN ENORMOUS ARMOURED MAMMAL 
VL-solwheim 1014.19 1016.27 s0001 THE SYSTEM WILL FIND THAT NORMAL 
VL-solwheim 1016.37 1023.12 s0001 WHAT WILL IT DO WITH A PLATTER PLUS YOU KNOW AN EGG LAYING VENOMOUS DUCK BILL BEAVER TAIL OTTER FOOTED MAMMAL 
VL-solwheim 1023.12 1026.69 s0001 HE THINKS IT'S NORMAL BUT IT'S AT THE ABSOLUTE OUTER REACHES 
VL-solwheim 1026.70 1030.05 s0001 OF WHAT CAN BE CONSIDERED NORMAL FOR AN ANIMAL IN THE ZOO 
VL-solwheim 1030.05 1034.16 s0001 UM SO I THINK THE ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS A LOT LIKE 
VL-solwheim 1034.18 1036.53 s0001 NEURAL NETWORKS G. A.'S RULE LEARNING 
VL-solwheim 1036.53 1038.82 s0001 HE SYSTEMS CAN ALL BE KIND OF 
VL-solwheim 1038.82 1042.56 s0001 A FIT TOGETHER TO BE DOING THE SAME KINDS OF TASKS 
VL-solwheim 1042.57 1045.37 s0001 YOU MIGHT LOOK AT THIS AND SAY WELL WE COULD DO THIS WITH A WITH A 
VL-solwheim 1045.39 1052.04 s0001 YOU KNOW WILL RULE BASED SYSTEM WE COULD DO THIS WITH INDUCTION WE COULD DO WITH THE NEURAL NETWORK YOU KNOW WHY USE AN ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 1052.05 1057.46 s0001 AND AND I THINK EVERY ONE OF THESE APPROACHES HAS SOME THINGS THAT IT'S IT'S GOOD AT 
VL-solwheim 1057.47 1062.00 s0001 SO AND I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING IN A MOMENT THAT IT PROBABLY IS IS MORE GOOD AT 
VL-solwheim 1062.01 1065.20 s0001 THEN DIFFERENTIATING ANIMALS IN A DATABASE 
VL-solwheim 1065.69 1069.68 s0001 SO WE ALL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME PRACTICAL AND APPLIED EXAMPLES 
VL-solwheim 1070.19 1074.31 s0001 SO THIS IS BEHAVIORAL BASED NETWORK SECURITY 
VL-solwheim 1074.32 1078.22 s0001 AND UM WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS YOU'RE STARTING WITH SOMETHING LIKE A 
VL-solwheim 1078.22 1081.49 s0001 A JOB OR OR O. S. EMBEDDED PROFILE OR 
VL-solwheim 1081.50 1084.95 s0001 THAT'S CREATING DATABASE ENTRIES LINKING PROCESSES THREADS 
VL-solwheim 1084.95 1087.34 s0001 AND RESOURCES TO BEHAVIOURS 
VL-solwheim 1087.34 1091.77 s0001 A AN ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM LEARNS WHAT NORMAL BEHAVIOURS ARE 
VL-solwheim 1091.78 1096.60 s0001 AND BLOCKS UNUSUAL BEHAVIOUR AFTER AFTER ASKING THE USER OR ADMINISTRATOR 
VL-solwheim 1096.61 1097.68 s0001 TO VERIFY 
VL-solwheim 1097.70 1099.96 s0001 A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS 
VL-solwheim 1099.97 1101.40 s0001 I BET YOU SAND 
VL-solwheim 1101.41 1105.08 s0001 BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND HUNDRED EMAILS IN A DAY 
VL-solwheim 1105.08 1107.33 s0001 BUT I BET YOU'VE NEVER SENT A THOUSAND 
VL-solwheim 1107.33 1109.32 s0001 BUT MOST VIRUSES WELL 
VL-solwheim 1109.96 1112.81 s0001 I BET THERE ARE DOMAINS IN THE WORLD 
VL-solwheim 1112.82 1113.98 s0001 AND PORTS 
VL-solwheim 1113.99 1117.95 s0001 ON YOUR COMPUTER THAT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO AND HAVE NEVER COMMUNICATED THROUGH 
VL-solwheim 1117.95 1119.21 s0001 BUT A VIRUS WELL 
VL-solwheim 1119.22 1120.52 s0001 YOU KNOW ABOUT NET WELL 
VL-solwheim 1120.53 1124.76 s0001 AND SO THERE ARE ACTUALLY BEHAVIORAL PROFILES FOR HOW YOU'RE USING YOUR MACHINE 
VL-solwheim 1124.76 1126.76 s0001 THAT CAN BE USED INSTEAD OF 
VL-solwheim 1126.77 1128.51 s0001 WHAT'S CALLED SIGNATURE BASED 
VL-solwheim 1128.52 1130.26 s0001 A VIRUS DETECTION 
VL-solwheim 1130.26 1133.65 s0001 AND HERE WE WE BASICALLY HAVE A SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 1133.65 1136.98 s0001 THAT IS GOING TO TO TO LOOK FOR UNUSUAL BEHAVIOURS AND THEN IT'S GOING 
VL-solwheim 1136.99 1139.65 s0001 FEED THAT BACK INTO THE REST OF THE NETWORK 
VL-solwheim 1139.66 1143.20 s0001 WHICH IS GOING TO BE IN THEORY GIVING IT 
VL-solwheim 1143.20 1148.07 s0001 A MORE UH PROTECTIVE COVERAGE AND MORE DIVERSITY 
VL-solwheim 1148.07 1149.99 s0001 AH AND VIGILANCE AGAINST IT 
VL-solwheim 1150.00 1151.33 s0001 POLY MORPH AS UM 
VL-solwheim 1151.33 1154.78 s0001 SO A LOT OF VIRUSES THEY CHANGE EVERY TIME THEY COPY 
VL-solwheim 1154.79 1158.23 s0001 A SYSTEM LIKE THIS WILL ALWAYS BE LOOKING FOR THOSE SMALL CHANGES 
VL-solwheim 1158.24 1161.71 s0001 BECAUSE THAT'S THE PART OF THE STATE SPACE IT'S GOING TO BE SEARCHING AND 
VL-solwheim 1161.72 1163.25 s0001 FOR EXAMPLE 
VL-solwheim 1166.05 1172.82 s0001 SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THE IMMUNE RESPONSE WILL INCLUDE SENDING ON DETAILS OF UNUSUAL BEHAVIOUR PROFILES 
VL-solwheim 1172.82 1178.47 s0001 TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REST OF THE SYSTEM OF THE REST OF THE COMPUTERS IN A LOCAL NETWORK ARE MUCH MORE VIGILANT 
VL-solwheim 1178.47 1180.05 s0001 AH AND THEN 
VL-solwheim 1180.06 1181.40 s0001 ON TO 
VL-solwheim 1181.42 1183.80 s0001 YOU KNOW A REMOTE SERVICES 
VL-solwheim 1185.80 1192.31 s0001 I WON'T GO ON TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE OF BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY MY WORK I'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF IT BUT 
VL-solwheim 1193.68 1195.99 s0001 SOMETHING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT UM 
VL-solwheim 1196.00 1197.84 s0001 ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS FOR 
VL-solwheim 1197.84 1200.83 s0001 A PHYSICAL SECURITY WHICH IS REALLY A GOOD FIT FOR 
VL-solwheim 1200.83 1202.43 s0001 FOR ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS 
VL-solwheim 1202.45 1206.37 s0001 SO UM HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VIDEO MOTION DETECTION 
VL-solwheim 1206.36 1209.73 s0001 WE START WITH VIDEO MOTION DETECTION THAT'S LOOKING FOR INTERESTING 
VL-solwheim 1209.74 1211.63 s0001 AREAS AREAS OF INTEREST 
VL-solwheim 1211.63 1217.58 s0001 IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER IT'S MARKED AREAS OF INTEREST THIS IS NOT USING AN ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT 
VL-solwheim 1217.58 1219.99 s0001 THIS IS JUST PREPROCESSING IN THE SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 1220.00 1224.30 s0001 IN THE LOWER RIGHT YOU SEE SOME EDGE DETECTION ALGORITHMS THAT ARE ONGOING 
VL-solwheim 1225.29 1229.84 s0001 SO WHAT WE BUILT IS WE BUILT A SYSTEM THAT WAS MULTI SITE 
VL-solwheim 1229.84 1236.26 s0001 A REAL TIME STREAMING VIDEO AND SOUND INTEGRATED OVER STANDARD NETWORKS ACROSS PLATFORMS AND THE VIDEO WAS TRANSFORMED 
VL-solwheim 1236.27 1239.07 s0001 INTO A VARIABLE CELLULAR AUTOMATA BREAD 
VL-solwheim 1239.08 1244.41 s0001 THAT ENCODES THE BEHAVIORAL IN REGIONAL INFORMATION SO YOU'VE GOT A SERIES OF CAMERAS 
VL-solwheim 1244.43 1247.73 s0001 IN MOST OF THESE EXAMPLES I WILL ONLY TALK ABOUT ONE CAMERA 
VL-solwheim 1247.74 1252.01 s0001 THE CAMERA THAT'S LOOKING INTO LEARNING BEHAVIOUR OF THE THINGS THAT IT SEEING 
VL-solwheim 1252.01 1255.31 s0001 IT'S COMPILING A LOT OF THAT BEHAVIORAL INFORMATION 
VL-solwheim 1255.32 1257.71 s0001 INTO A A MATHEMATICAL 
VL-solwheim 1257.72 1259.01 s0001 INTERFACE 
VL-solwheim 1259.02 1260.11 s0001 AND 
VL-solwheim 1260.13 1263.20 s0001 AND THAT IT IS FEEDING FORWARD THESE BEHAVIOURAL PRIMITIVES 
VL-solwheim 1263.21 1265.30 s0001 INTO AN ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 1265.31 1266.74 s0001 SO I SHOULD SAY 
VL-solwheim 1266.74 1270.20 s0001 THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS IS YOU SET UP A CAMERA AND YOU LEAVE THAT 
VL-solwheim 1270.21 1271.54 s0001 YOU DON'T TRAIN IT 
VL-solwheim 1271.55 1273.37 s0001 OR THERE IS A TRAINING FACE 
VL-solwheim 1273.39 1276.38 s0001 GENERALLY SPEAKING YOU'RE NOT TRAINING IT TO UM 
VL-solwheim 1276.38 1278.81 s0001 TO RECOGNISE SPECIFIC THINGS 
VL-solwheim 1280.32 1284.45 s0001 SO HERE AGAIN BEHAVIOURS ARE COMPILED INTO C. A. STRUCTURES 
VL-solwheim 1284.46 1291.83 s0001 AND THESE FORM THE INPUT TO THE A. I. S. SHELL HERE YOU SEE THAT THAT'S THAT THE SYSTEM HAS FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT IT IS WATCHING 
VL-solwheim 1294.23 1299.33 s0001 AND THERE'S ALSO A TYPES OF ADVANCED ENVIRONMENTAL LEARNING THAT ITS ABSTRACTION 
VL-solwheim 1299.34 1302.98 s0001 A BEHAVIOURAL PRIMITIVES AND THIS INCLUDES THINGS LIKE TIME SERIES 
VL-solwheim 1302.99 1305.10 s0001 SENSITIVITY IN SOUND ANALYSIS 
VL-solwheim 1305.11 1307.54 s0001 BUT LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS SLIDE 
VL-solwheim 1307.63 1312.41 s0001 UM YOU KNOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF LENSES THAT CAN BE PUT ON 
VL-solwheim 1312.42 1314.36 s0001 TO THE INTERFACE AND ONE OF THEM IS A 
VL-solwheim 1314.37 1316.33 s0001 SHOW ME YOUR TOLERANCE 
VL-solwheim 1316.34 1319.00 s0001 AND YOUR IDEAS ABOUT MOTION 
VL-solwheim 1319.01 1322.85 s0001 AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THIS SLIDE IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MOTION OUT HERE ON THE STREET 
VL-solwheim 1322.85 1325.19 s0001 THERE'S A LITTLE MOTION HERE IN THE FOREGROUND 
VL-solwheim 1325.21 1327.14 s0001 THERE'S A LOT OF MOTION UP IN THE TREES 
VL-solwheim 1327.15 1328.98 s0001 SO THOSE ARE VERY VERY SIMPLE 
VL-solwheim 1328.99 1331.15 s0001 WAY OF LOOKING AT HOW IT MIGHT BE 
VL-solwheim 1331.15 1333.09 s0001 CONCEPTUALIZING WHAT IT SEEING 
VL-solwheim 1333.10 1335.62 s0001 AND THEN COMPILING IT INTO BEHAVIOURS 
VL-solwheim 1338.69 1342.69 s0001 YEAH IT'S NOT EVEN COMPARING IMAGES IT'S KIDS DOING A KIND OF 
VL-solwheim 1342.70 1347.27 s0001 A GRADE BASED IT'S LOOKING FOR THINGS PASSING BETWEEN GRID POINTS 
VL-solwheim 1347.28 1351.28 s0001 A HEARING I'M TALKING LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 
VL-solwheim 1351.29 1356.05 s0001 BUT HERE YOU KNOW THERE'S A VARIABLE OVERLAY GRID ALL SORTS OF USER CONTROLS 
VL-solwheim 1356.53 1357.94 s0001 AH 
VL-solwheim 1357.95 1361.02 s0001 WE WE WE ADDED TO THAT THINGS LIKE UM 
VL-solwheim 1361.02 1364.04 s0001 GOOD BASED MOTION VECTOR ANALYSIS AND WAITING 
VL-solwheim 1364.04 1367.31 s0001 A MASS LOCKING MAGNIFICATION IS AN ALARM BROWSER 
VL-solwheim 1367.31 1374.61 s0001 WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE INTERESTINGLY IT'S A A FELLOW WHO IS BICYCLING AROUND AND YOU KNOW THE FRONT OF OF OUR LABORATORY 
VL-solwheim 1374.62 1378.01 s0001 AND THE SYSTEMS LEARNING WHAT DIRECTION HE'S GOING AND 
VL-solwheim 1378.01 1382.75 s0001 AND IT'S KIND OF MARKED IT UP A LITTLE ARROWS WITH LITTLE WHITE HEADS SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THAT 
VL-solwheim 1382.76 1388.60 s0001 IS THAT THIS GUY IS I'M GOING AROUND IN A CIRCLE AND IT'S LEARNING THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEHAVIOURAL PRIMITIVES 
VL-solwheim 1388.71 1390.49 s0001 AGAIN WHAT WE'RE SEEING 
VL-solwheim 1390.50 1391.98 s0001 A ON THIS 
VL-solwheim 1391.99 1397.38 s0001 ON THIS SLIDE IS REALLY KIND OF A SHORTHAND FOR WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES 
VL-solwheim 1397.92 1400.61 s0001 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME ALARMS THAT WE HAD 
VL-solwheim 1400.61 1403.71 s0001 BECAUSE THEY WILL ILLUSTRATE THE KIND OF LEARNING IT WAS ABLE TO DO 
VL-solwheim 1403.73 1410.71 s0001 IN THIS FIRST PICTURE THIS IS A PERFECTLY NORMAL THING IT'S OBSERVING A PERSON IN IT DOESN'T FIND ANYTHING UNUSUAL 
VL-solwheim 1411.05 1415.35 s0001 IN THE SECOND SLIDE YOU'VE GOT A PERSON WHO HAS STEPPED OUT FROM BEHIND A TREE 
VL-solwheim 1415.36 1417.04 s0001 AH FOR WHATEVER REASON 
VL-solwheim 1417.05 1421.03 s0001 BUT IT HAD NEVER SEEN THAT AND IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY STRANGE 
VL-solwheim 1421.03 1424.45 s0001 BECAUSE NO ONE EVER WALKS ON THAT GRASS SO FOR SOMEONE TO APPEAR 
VL-solwheim 1424.46 1425.75 s0001 FROM BEHIND A TREE 
VL-solwheim 1425.75 1427.39 s0001 THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS UNUSUAL 
VL-solwheim 1427.39 1428.81 s0001 IN THIS PICTURE 
VL-solwheim 1428.81 1432.16 s0001 UM WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE ALARM WAS 
VL-solwheim 1432.16 1437.43 s0001 BUT WE REALISE LATER THAT THE BUILDING BEHIND THESE TREES HAD CAUGHT ON FIRE 
VL-solwheim 1437.43 1439.58 s0001 AND WAS PRODUCING SMOKE 
VL-solwheim 1439.58 1441.30 s0001 THE SMOKE WAS COMING UP AND 
VL-solwheim 1441.31 1446.44 s0001 AND SINCE IT HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING MOVE THROUGH THE SKY IN THE FOREGROUND IN THIS MANNER 
VL-solwheim 1446.44 1450.29 s0001 IT TOOK A PICTURE AND ISSUED A WARNING YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE SLOPE 
VL-solwheim 1450.30 1452.80 s0001 MARKED IN RED UP HERE AND HERE 
VL-solwheim 1455.94 1458.04 s0001 A MORE ALARMS 
VL-solwheim 1461.62 1464.16 s0001 SO HERE ON THE RIGHT WE ARE 
VL-solwheim 1464.18 1467.75 s0001 WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE IN THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE POSTMAN 
VL-solwheim 1467.75 1469.70 s0001 AND THE POSTMAN WAS DRUNK 
VL-solwheim 1469.70 1472.00 s0001 AND HIS BICYCLE WAS WEAVING 
VL-solwheim 1472.00 1475.54 s0001 LIKE THIS AND IT IT FOUND THAT TO BE VERY UNUSUAL 
VL-solwheim 1475.54 1480.48 s0001 HERE WE THOUGHT THAT THIS CAR WAS GOING THE WRONG WAY ON THIS ONE WAY SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 1480.48 1482.56 s0001 BUT IT ACTUALLY WAS THAT A PERSON 
VL-solwheim 1482.57 1483.83 s0001 HAD WALKED IN 
VL-solwheim 1483.84 1487.06 s0001 AND HE WAS BLOCKING THE SENSOR AND HOLDING THE GATE OPEN 
VL-solwheim 1487.06 1489.87 s0001 AND IT HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE DO THAT BEFORE 
VL-solwheim 1491.49 1493.88 s0001 SO A LITTLE MORE ABOUT SOFTWARE 
VL-solwheim 1493.89 1494.99 s0001 ENGINEERING 
VL-solwheim 1495.00 1500.82 s0001 AH WE DID A COMPLETE INSTALLATION WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CAMERAS DOING THREE D. SYNTHESIS WHICH IS 
VL-solwheim 1500.83 1502.56 s0001 ACTUALLY VERY DIFFICULT UM 
VL-solwheim 1502.57 1503.85 s0001 IN THIS EXAMPLE 
VL-solwheim 1503.85 1506.62 s0001 AND THIS SYSTEM WAS SO 
VL-solwheim 1506.62 1508.80 s0001 WAS TAKEN FORWARD TO PATENT 
VL-solwheim 1508.81 1510.92 s0001 AND HAS BEEN PROPERTIZED 
VL-solwheim 1511.22 1516.18 s0001 I THINK THAT'S ALL FRUIT FOR THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS ONE 
VL-solwheim 1520.59 1523.95 s0001 I'LL GIVE A FEW MORE EXAMPLES JUST TO FINISH THIS OFF 
VL-solwheim 1523.97 1529.08 s0001 SO UM THIS SAME SYSTEM WE COULD UNPLUG BEEN RESET AND WE TAKE IT TO WAREHOUSE 
VL-solwheim 1529.09 1533.98 s0001 WE WE WE WE PUT THE CAMERA ON THE WAREHOUSE SO THAT IT CAN SEE PEOPLE GOING IN AND COMING OUT 
VL-solwheim 1533.98 1536.65 s0001 HOW DO WE KNOW WHO WORKS THERE AND WHO DOESN'T 
VL-solwheim 1536.65 1538.46 s0001 AND HAVING TRIED THIS 
VL-solwheim 1538.46 1541.66 s0001 THE A. I. S. LEARNS THAT WORKERS TAKE THE SHORTEST PATH 
VL-solwheim 1541.67 1543.03 s0001 TO THEIR TARGETS 
VL-solwheim 1543.03 1544.32 s0001 BUT INTRUDERS DON'T 
VL-solwheim 1544.33 1547.28 s0001 PEOPLE WERE IN THEIR STEALING THINGS DON'T TAKE THE SHORTEST PATH 
VL-solwheim 1547.29 1548.94 s0001 THEY GO ALONG THE EDGES 
VL-solwheim 1548.95 1551.50 s0001 AND WHEN THEY REACH A JUNCTION THEY DON'T JUST KEEP GOING 
VL-solwheim 1551.50 1554.77 s0001 BECAUSE THESE ARE BEHAVIOURS THAT THE SYSTEM LEARNS 
VL-solwheim 1554.77 1557.26 s0001 AND IT KNOWS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT CORRECT 
VL-solwheim 1557.27 1561.47 s0001 IN A MUSEUM YOU CAN TAKE THE SAME SYSTEM POINTED AT A ROOM IN A MUSEUM 
VL-solwheim 1561.48 1566.69 s0001 THE ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL LEARN WHERE PEOPLE STAND IN HOW QUICKLY THEY MOVE IN WHAT AREAS ARE FORBIDDEN 
VL-solwheim 1566.70 1570.38 s0001 SO FOR EXAMPLE OF THE SYSTEM WILL LEARN THAT ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO 
VL-solwheim 1570.38 1575.36 s0001 TOUCH A PAINTING OR NOT SUPPOSED TO CLIMB ON FURNITURE CAN SUPPOSE TO GO OUT THE WINDOW 
VL-solwheim 1575.44 1578.33 s0001 IN AN OFFICE SETTING WE ALSO TESTED 
VL-solwheim 1578.34 1584.12 s0001 ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS A WERE ABLE TO LEARN THAT PEOPLE COME AND GO AND SIT AND TALK IN EAT AND DRINK 
VL-solwheim 1584.13 1586.21 s0001 BUT THEY DO NOT COME IN THROUGH THE WINDOW 
VL-solwheim 1586.21 1587.64 s0001 THEY DON'T COME TO THE CEILING 
VL-solwheim 1587.65 1590.82 s0001 DON'T STAND ON TABLES FIRE GUNS OR SMOKE 
VL-solwheim 1590.82 1596.34 s0001 SO IT'S REALLY IT'S IT'S BECOMING VERY VIGILANT TOWARDS UNUSUAL BEHAVIORS 
VL-solwheim 1596.35 1598.69 s0001 AS YOU SAY THERE'S A PART OF THE STATE SPACE 
VL-solwheim 1598.71 1600.87 s0001 THAT IS ENCAPSULATED AS BEING NORMAL 
VL-solwheim 1600.88 1603.69 s0001 EVERYTHING OUTSIDE OF THAT IS LESS NORMAL 
VL-solwheim 1603.69 1609.69 s0001 AND IN AN AIRPORT SETTING AND A I ASK AND LEARN THE SPEED AND ANGLE OF APPROACH IS FOR DIFFERENT SIZE AIRCRAFT 
VL-solwheim 1609.69 1612.71 s0001 AND WATCH FOR STRANGE BEHAVIOURS ON THE APRON THE RUNWAYS 
VL-solwheim 1612.71 1616.74 s0001 A MOST AIRCRAFT DISASTERS HAPPEN 
VL-solwheim 1616.75 1617.86 s0001 ON THE GROUND 
VL-solwheim 1617.87 1619.14 s0001 AND NOT IN THE AIR 
VL-solwheim 1619.14 1621.91 s0001 UM WHICH IS WHY YOU PUT THE SEATBELT ON WHEN YOU'RE ON 
VL-solwheim 1621.91 1624.07 s0001 THE GROUNDS AND NOW WHEN YOU'RE IN THE AIR 
VL-solwheim 1624.07 1625.34 s0001 AND 
VL-solwheim 1625.35 1627.41 s0001 AND THERE'S ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT 
VL-solwheim 1627.42 1629.43 s0001 BAD THINGS THAT HAPPEN ON THE GROUNDS 
VL-solwheim 1629.44 1631.69 s0001 THERE'S BIRDS RUNAWAY SWITCH 
VL-solwheim 1631.70 1633.94 s0001 AND I FOUND OUT WAS VERY COMMON 
VL-solwheim 1633.95 1635.53 s0001 SO YOU KNOW YOUR LOVER 
VL-solwheim 1635.54 1637.12 s0001 HE'S FLYING AWAY 
VL-solwheim 1637.13 1640.04 s0001 FOREVER AND YOU RUN OUT TO CATCH HER PLANE 
VL-solwheim 1640.04 1642.13 s0001 YOU ARE SUCKED INTO THE ENGINE 
VL-solwheim 1642.13 1645.61 s0001 SO YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS NOT A COMMON PROBLEM 
VL-solwheim 1645.62 1647.85 s0001 BUT IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM 
VL-solwheim 1647.86 1649.84 s0001 A IDEA DOWN 
VL-solwheim 1649.85 1651.33 s0001 I DID ENGINE 
VL-solwheim 1651.34 1653.17 s0001 FAULT DETECTION FOR 
VL-solwheim 1653.19 1656.75 s0001 A GUY G. AIRCRAFT ENGINE SERVICES IN WALES 
VL-solwheim 1656.76 1662.07 s0001 AND THEY SAID THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS AND THAT IT SHUTS DOWN A PLANE FOR A MONTH 
VL-solwheim 1662.08 1667.22 s0001 AND IF YOU ARE SUCKED THROUGH A JET ENGINE THE ONLY THING THAT WILL REMAIN ON THE OTHER SIDE 
VL-solwheim 1667.22 1668.62 s0001 ARE YOUR TEETH 
VL-solwheim 1669.42 1673.72 s0001 UM SO THERE'S BIRDS THERE'S PLANES OFF THE APRON GUIDE PEOPLE RUNNING 
VL-solwheim 1673.73 1676.66 s0001 LUGGAGE THAT IS FALLING AND BREAKING THERE'S FIRES 
VL-solwheim 1676.67 1680.37 s0001 ANYONE HAS EVER BEEN AT AN AIRPORT KNOWS HOW BAD THIS CAN BE 
VL-solwheim 1680.37 1683.07 s0001 AND THERE'S A GREAT VIDEO ON YOUTUBE 
VL-solwheim 1683.08 1684.91 s0001 OF AN EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY 
VL-solwheim 1684.93 1687.87 s0001 BUT REALLY BIG WHEN THE NEW AIRBUS A THREE EIGHTY 
VL-solwheim 1687.87 1693.63 s0001 AND IT'S GOING ALONG THE APRON AND THE EDGE OF ITS WING GRABS A SMALLER PLANE HAVE YOU SEEN THIS 
VL-solwheim 1693.64 1695.83 s0001 IF YOU LOOK ON YOUTUBE YOU WILL SEE IT 
VL-solwheim 1695.84 1699.30 s0001 IT'S GOING ALONG THE APRON IT'S IT'S JUST THIS MUCH TOO CLOSE 
VL-solwheim 1699.30 1703.71 s0001 TO A SMALLER PLANE AND IT'S WEIGHING GRABS WAS PLAYING AND SPINS IT 
VL-solwheim 1703.71 1706.10 s0001 CAUSING A LOT OF DAMAGE OBVIOUSLY 
VL-solwheim 1706.11 1708.09 s0001 AND THAT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IF 
VL-solwheim 1708.09 1711.65 s0001 A SYSTEM LIKE THIS HAD BEEN WATCHING BECAUSE IT WOULD KNOW THAT WITH IT 
VL-solwheim 1711.66 1713.05 s0001 FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE 
VL-solwheim 1713.06 1716.46 s0001 WE NEVER DID THIS BEFORE THIS IS AND IT'S JUST TOO CLOSE 
VL-solwheim 1716.46 1719.69 s0001 AND FINALLY COURSE THERE'S A LOT OF MILITARY APPLICATIONS 
VL-solwheim 1719.70 1721.11 s0001 SO 
VL-solwheim 1726.58 1730.73 s0001 IT IT DEPENDS IF YOU CAN LEARN AS QUICKLY 
VL-solwheim 1730.73 1736.28 s0001 AS YOU CAN REPRESENT A BASIC DATA SET SO I WOULD SAY IF WE PUT A SYSTEM LIKE THIS 
VL-solwheim 1736.28 1738.65 s0001 UP HERE JUST ONE LECTURER 
VL-solwheim 1738.66 1739.78 s0001 WOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH 
VL-solwheim 1739.79 1743.48 s0001 AS LONG AS ALL OF KNOW ALL OF THE NORMAL BEHAVIOURS HERE WE REPRESENT 
VL-solwheim 1743.49 1745.37 s0001 PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO UP AND DOWN STAIRS 
VL-solwheim 1745.38 1748.50 s0001 TWO AND COME IN AND TALK AND MOVE AROUND 
VL-solwheim 1748.51 1752.38 s0001 AH BUT FOR EXAMPLE NONE OF US WILL LEVITATE THROUGH THE CEILING 
VL-solwheim 1752.38 1753.63 s0001 VERY UNLIKELY 
VL-solwheim 1753.64 1756.80 s0001 UM NONE OF US ARE GOING TO STAND UP AND SHOUT 
VL-solwheim 1756.81 1759.47 s0001 AH WELL NORMALLY THAT'S TRUE 
VL-solwheim 1759.64 1764.11 s0001 SO AH THE LEARNING TIME CAN BE VERY SHORT AND THE SELECTION TIME 
VL-solwheim 1764.12 1767.53 s0001 IT CAN BE VERY SHORT FOR THE ANTIBODIES IT DEPENDS ON 
VL-solwheim 1767.54 1770.61 s0001 AH HOW COMPLEX THE REPRESENTATION YES 
VL-solwheim 1770.61 1775.26 s0001 AS WELL SO VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM WILL REQUIRE A LOT A LOT MORE LEARNING 
VL-solwheim 1776.61 1779.51 s0001 ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT A B. M. D. 
VL-solwheim 1787.74 1793.20 s0001 BUT THERE'S THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU COULD USE IT IN PLACE OF ALMOST ANY OTHER A. I. SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 1793.21 1795.33 s0001 THERE'S A LOT OF EQUIVALENCY THERE 
VL-solwheim 1795.34 1798.83 s0001 I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT WILL APPEAR HERE A LITTLE LATER 
VL-solwheim 1798.84 1799.94 s0001 IS UM 
VL-solwheim 1799.95 1801.74 s0001 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MATCHING 
VL-solwheim 1801.75 1803.90 s0001 AND BINDING IN IMMUNOLOGY 
VL-solwheim 1803.91 1805.93 s0001 IT'S NOT JUST TWO STRINGS ARE SIMILAR 
VL-solwheim 1805.94 1810.72 s0001 SO THERE'S A MORPHOLOGY AND MORPHOLOGY IS A TWO DIMENSIONAL TWO OR THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPE 
VL-solwheim 1810.72 1814.45 s0001 THAT CAN OR CANNOT MATCH LIKE THREE DIMENSIONAL PUZZLE PIECES 
VL-solwheim 1814.69 1821.99 s0001 AND UH FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY WE WANT TO BUILD CONSTRAINTS INTO THE SYSTEM OR USE IT AS A CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION SOLVER 
VL-solwheim 1821.99 1824.84 s0001 OR WE WOULD DO IS WE WOULD CREATE A REPRESENTATION 
VL-solwheim 1824.85 1826.12 s0001 IT HAS A SHAPE 
VL-solwheim 1826.12 1827.70 s0001 I ONLY ALLOWS 
VL-solwheim 1827.72 1832.05 s0001 VALID SOLUTION CHUNKS WERE OR CHUNKS OF THE SOLUTION THAT 
VL-solwheim 1832.06 1833.75 s0001 SATISFY CERTAIN CONSTRAINTS 
VL-solwheim 1833.76 1837.17 s0001 IMAGINE WE'RE TRYING TO DO SCHEDULING FOR CLASSROOMS 
VL-solwheim 1837.17 1840.16 s0001 YOU COULD CREATE A UM AN ANTIBODY 
VL-solwheim 1840.16 1841.36 s0001 MORPHOLOGY 
VL-solwheim 1841.37 1844.72 s0001 THEY HAD SOME THAT HAD AVAILABLE CLASSROOMS 
VL-solwheim 1844.73 1846.05 s0001 AS EDGES 
VL-solwheim 1846.05 1848.62 s0001 DETAILS MOTHER AVAILABLE CLASSROOMS 
VL-solwheim 1848.63 1850.18 s0001 AND THE MAIN GOAL 
VL-solwheim 1850.19 1853.17 s0001 OF THE OF THE TOPOLOGY 
VL-solwheim 1853.18 1854.67 s0001 OF THE ANTI BODY 
VL-solwheim 1854.68 1857.48 s0001 WOULD BE SOME ASPECT OF THE TIME 
VL-solwheim 1857.81 1862.99 s0001 FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN USING THAT YOU WOULD BASICALLY BE ENCODING INTO IT SOME IDEA 
VL-solwheim 1863.00 1868.51 s0001 OF WHAT ARE VALID CHUNKS OR PARTS OF THE SOLUTION IN A TIMETABLE AND PROBLEM 
VL-solwheim 1868.52 1872.92 s0001 UM AND THERE ARE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED THAT USER G. A. FOR EVOLVING 
VL-solwheim 1872.93 1874.33 s0001 MORPHOLOGIES 
VL-solwheim 1874.33 1877.09 s0001 AS CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION SOLVERS 
VL-solwheim 1877.09 1881.51 s0001 SO HERE I'M GOING TO TALK FOR MAYBE FIVE MINUTES ABOUT BUILDING A BETTER SHELL SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 1881.51 1888.15 s0001 IN THIS SLIDE BEFORE A. T. M. D. USE A VERY SIMPLE SYSTEM THAT I WROTE IT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ON THE WEB 
VL-solwheim 1888.16 1893.62 s0001 AND I'M GOING TO SHOW UP A BETTER SHELL SYSTEM SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT ALSO ABOUT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 
VL-solwheim 1894.15 1895.54 s0001 SO UM 
VL-solwheim 1895.55 1897.85 s0001 AND SOME COLLEAGUES MYSELF WE BUILT A YEAH 
VL-solwheim 1897.86 1899.57 s0001 THE NEXT GENERATION SHELL 
VL-solwheim 1899.57 1902.46 s0001 AND WE TRIED TO TAKE IN A LOT OF THE 
VL-solwheim 1902.46 1905.08 s0001 THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE PREVIOUS GEL SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 1905.08 1907.12 s0001 YOU KNOW AND KIND OF WORK THROUGH THEM 
VL-solwheim 1907.12 1911.26 s0001 SO THAT A LOT OF THINGS IN IMMUNOLOGY THAT ARE NOT IN AN A. I. S. SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 1911.26 1916.28 s0001 BECAUSE A HUMAN IMMUNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX 
VL-solwheim 1916.29 1920.40 s0001 AND SO WE WORKED ON THINGS LIKE MULTIPLE ANTIBODY MODELS 
VL-solwheim 1920.41 1922.62 s0001 AND REPRESENTATIONS SO 
VL-solwheim 1922.63 1928.69 s0001 THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT JUST BE CELLS AND T. CELLS THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION MOVING AROUND IN A SUIT 
VL-solwheim 1928.69 1935.22 s0001 AND THERE'S ALL ELECTRICAL EFFECTS BIOCHEMICAL EFFECTS ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS HAVE TO DO WITH THE WAY THE MATCHING WORKS 
VL-solwheim 1935.22 1939.19 s0001 AND ACTUALLY A LOT OF THESE ASPECTS OF IMMUNOLOGY ARE NOT REALLY VERY WELL KNOWN 
VL-solwheim 1939.20 1941.13 s0001 IN IN HUMAN IMMUNOLOGY 
VL-solwheim 1941.14 1946.82 s0001 WE WE PUT TOGETHER MULTIPLE MATCHING ALGORITHMS SOUL KIND OF ALGORITHMS ARE GOING THE MATCHING 
VL-solwheim 1946.83 1950.28 s0001 UM USING FUZZY OPERATORS NETWORKING DATABASE 
VL-solwheim 1950.29 1953.40 s0001 TODAY'S VISUALIZATION OF VARIABLE CLONING METHODS 
VL-solwheim 1953.41 1958.99 s0001 I THINK THE ONLY ONE HERE IF YOU KNOW MACHINE LEARNING THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN IS PROBABLY THIS ONE 
VL-solwheim 1959.09 1963.17 s0001 THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MORPHOLOGY IN THE REPRESENTATION 
VL-solwheim 1963.19 1965.27 s0001 IS IS REALLY KIND OF HARD TO 
VL-solwheim 1965.28 1966.97 s0001 VISUALIZE IN SOME WAYS 
VL-solwheim 1966.97 1968.86 s0001 HOW DOES THE MORPHOLOGY EFFECT 
VL-solwheim 1968.87 1970.27 s0001 THE MATCHING 
VL-solwheim 1971.68 1976.06 s0001 AND SO HERE ARE JUST SOME IMAGES THIS IS MORE ABOUT THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 
VL-solwheim 1976.07 1980.30 s0001 AND HERE YOU SEE AN IMMUNE RESPONSE WITH VARIABLE CLONING AND DIAGNOSTICS 
VL-solwheim 1980.31 1984.33 s0001 HERE IT'S UM IT'S DOING DATA ANALYSIS ON ME I ADDRESS 
VL-solwheim 1984.34 1986.73 s0001 A MACHINE LEARNING SAID 
VL-solwheim 1987.55 1990.52 s0001 UM THIS IS YOU KNOW NETWORK TOPOLOGY IS FOR 
VL-solwheim 1990.53 1993.17 s0001 FOR HOW YOU SHARE OR ANTIBODIES 
VL-solwheim 1995.83 2002.01 s0001 THIS IS A VISUAL IMMUNE SPACE BROWSER EDITING TOOL THIS HAS AN INTEGRATED FUZZY ENGINE SO YOU CAN KIND OF 
VL-solwheim 2002.02 2005.23 s0001 YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH ONE OFF OSSIFY AND THEN YOU CAN YOU KNOW 
VL-solwheim 2005.24 2007.10 s0001 MOVE SWITCHES AROUND 
VL-solwheim 2007.61 2010.19 s0001 AND THE VISUAL DATA BROWSER 
VL-solwheim 2010.21 2014.74 s0001 AND THE EDITING TOOL HAD C. FOUR POINT FIVE STYLE INDUCTED VISUALIZATIONS IT WAS GOING THROUGH 
VL-solwheim 2014.75 2016.22 s0001 A COMPLEX DATA SET 
VL-solwheim 2016.23 2019.97 s0001 IT WAS CHOOSING THE THINGS THAT IT THOUGHT WERE CRUCIAL FOR MAKING A GOOD 
VL-solwheim 2019.98 2021.93 s0001 CLASSIFICATION DISTINCTION 
VL-solwheim 2021.94 2024.66 s0001 AND YOU'RE YOU'RE KIND OF SINGING A LITTLE BIT OF THIS 
VL-solwheim 2024.67 2028.62 s0001 HERE THIS IS ACTUALLY THE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CYRUS 
VL-solwheim 2029.66 2036.05 s0001 AND HERE'S A MORE ADVANCED EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE IT BEGINNING TO GENERATE ANTIBODIES IN STATE SPACE 
VL-solwheim 2036.05 2039.15 s0001 AND THE GREEN IS ITS SENSE OF SELF 
VL-solwheim 2039.51 2043.86 s0001 SO IT'S NOT BEYOND THE IRIS EXAMPLES THAT'S ITS SENSE OF SELF 
VL-solwheim 2044.10 2047.09 s0001 SOME KIND OF A COMPLICATED GRAPHIC 
VL-solwheim 2048.23 2054.06 s0001 THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL IMAGE BECAUSE OF THIS IS IS THE ANTIBODIES THAT ARE MAXIMAL 
VL-solwheim 2054.07 2056.67 s0001 FOR FOR DISTINGUISHING THE I. R. S. 
VL-solwheim 2056.67 2058.91 s0001 SET IT FORMS AN ONION 
VL-solwheim 2058.92 2060.96 s0001 INSIDE THE STATE SPACE 
VL-solwheim 2061.96 2063.70 s0001 VERY INTERESTING 
VL-solwheim 2064.81 2066.77 s0001 AND A FIVE FINALLY 
VL-solwheim 2066.78 2067.95 s0001 AND LAST SLIDE 
VL-solwheim 2067.94 2070.04 s0001 OUR CONCLUSIONS AND OPEN QUESTIONS 
VL-solwheim 2070.04 2072.48 s0001 A I S. SYSTEMS AT A VERY YOUNG 
VL-solwheim 2072.50 2074.16 s0001 AND WIDE OPEN FIELD 
VL-solwheim 2074.16 2078.85 s0001 THE RULE OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND PLAUSIBILITY N. A. I. S. SYSTEMS 
VL-solwheim 2078.86 2084.02 s0001 THINGS LIKE MESSENGER CELLS MEMORY CELLS REALLY PEOPLE ARE JUST BEGINNING TO DEAL WITH THAT 
VL-solwheim 2084.03 2087.92 s0001 OF THE RULE OF MORPHOLOGY REPRESENTATION IS VERY INTERESTING 
VL-solwheim 2087.92 2093.43 s0001 AND I HAVE A PAPER HERE THAT SO YOU CAN PICK UP IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN A MORE TECHNICAL DETAILS 
VL-solwheim 2093.44 2096.88 s0001 THE PAPER THIS ONE IS VERY INTERESTING AND IT'S ABOUT 
VL-solwheim 2096.89 2098.98 s0001 MORPHOLOGY REPRESENTATION 
VL-solwheim 2098.98 2102.16 s0001 A MATCHING ALGORITHMS AND METHODOLOGIES 
VL-solwheim 2102.16 2105.83 s0001 A WHAT APPLICATIONS WILL A I S. SYSTEMS REALLY EXCEL AT 
VL-solwheim 2105.84 2110.54 s0001 I THINK PEOPLE ARE APPLYING ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN APPLY A NEURAL NETWORK TO 
VL-solwheim 2110.55 2114.08 s0001 BUT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR PROBLEMS WHERE YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT A PROBLEM IT'S 
VL-solwheim 2114.09 2115.77 s0001 ONLY KNOW WHAT'S NORMAL 
VL-solwheim 2115.92 2117.50 s0001 AND OF COURSE IT'S 
VL-solwheim 2117.51 2119.96 s0001 EXCITING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE BIRTH OF A NEW FIELD 
VL-solwheim 2119.96 2123.48 s0001 THIS FIELD IS REALLY ONLY BEEN AROUND SINCE ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
VL-solwheim 2123.48 2128.79 s0001 IT'S ONLY REALLY BECOME A COMMON THING IN MACHINE LEARNING SINCE ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY 
VL-solwheim 2128.79 2130.94 s0001 EIGHT PERHAPS 
VL-solwheim 2131.28 2134.24 s0001 FINALLY THANKS TO NOT I N. G. S. I. 
VL-solwheim 2134.25 2137.84 s0001 AND YOU CAN CONTACT ME AT AT R. W. 
VL-solwheim 2137.85 2140.06 s0001 THAT CANBERRA SCIENTIFIC THAT COME 
VL-solwheim 2140.07 2141.69 s0001 YOU CAN DOWNLOAD A 
VL-solwheim 2141.69 2144.71 s0001 FIRST OF THE TWO SHELL SYSTEMS AT THIS ADDRESS 
VL-solwheim 2144.71 2149.10 s0001 I CAN SEND YOU A COPY OF THE N. G. SHELL IF YOU'RE GOOD WITH JOB OR 
VL-solwheim 2149.11 2153.29 s0001 IF YOU EMAIL ME AND FINALLY THERE'S A PAPER HERE THAT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FROM THE WEB 
VL-solwheim 2153.29 2155.79 s0001 A OR I HAVE A THING TWENTY COPIES HERE 
VL-solwheim 2155.80 2157.01 s0001 IF YOU'D LIKE 
VL-solwheim 2157.02 2157.37 s0001 AND 
VL-solwheim 2157.37 2158.56 s0024 QUESTIONS 
VL-solwheim 2159.28 2161.17 s0024 THE ONE WHO 
VL-solwheim 2176.48 2177.91 s0024 IT'S BEEN DONE 
VL-solwheim 2177.91 2178.48 s0001 UM 
VL-solwheim 2178.50 2182.90 s0001 PART OF WHAT IS SO GOOD ABOUT THE ADVANCED VIDEO MOTION DETECTION THINK 
VL-solwheim 2182.91 2186.85 s0001 THAT IS THAT IS THAT WE IMAGINE THAT OR SOMEONE TRYING TO SELL IT 
VL-solwheim 2186.86 2189.54 s0001 I'M NOT SAYING THE POINT IS TO SELL THE LET'S SAY YOU WERE 
VL-solwheim 2189.55 2193.96 s0001 IT'S BASICALLY THEY ASK YOU HOW DO YOU SET IT UP POTTY TRAINING WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE ANSWER IS 
VL-solwheim 2193.96 2197.48 s0001 YOU POINT THE CAMERA AT WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO PROTECT 
VL-solwheim 2197.48 2200.04 s0001 WHEN YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND THEN THAT'S THE END OF THAT 
VL-solwheim 2200.06 2205.29 s0001 YOU KNOW SO BASICALLY IT'S GOING THROUGH THE LEARNING CYCLE BY ITSELF AND AFTER A FEW DAYS 
VL-solwheim 2205.30 2208.86 s0001 IN A ROOM LIKE THIS WELL THERE WAS NO FIRE THERE WAS NO FAST WE PUSH THE BUTTON 
VL-solwheim 2208.87 2210.02 s0001 AND THAT'S BASICALLY IT 
VL-solwheim 2210.03 2214.27 s0001 AFTER THAT THERE MAY BE ITERATIVE REFINEMENT SINCE LEARNING ABOUT NEW THINGS 
VL-solwheim 2214.27 2216.62 s0001 FOR EXAMPLE WE WOULD ALL GET UP IN WRONG 
VL-solwheim 2216.63 2218.34 s0001 OUT OF THE ROOM 
VL-solwheim 2218.35 2220.14 s0001 IT WOULD SOUND AN ALARM 
VL-solwheim 2220.15 2221.99 s0001 AND YOU CAN IMAGINE A LOT OF 
VL-solwheim 2222.00 2224.90 s0001 UH VERY USEFUL APPLICATIONS FOR THAT 
VL-solwheim 2224.91 2226.77 s0001 PARTICULARLY WHERE YOU NEED TO HAVE 
VL-solwheim 2226.78 2231.26 s0001 OUR AS YOU SAY STREAMING REAL TIME RECOGNITION PLACES LIKE IN AN AIRPORT 
VL-solwheim 2231.27 2234.27 s0001 WE MAY ONLY HAVE TEN SECONDS TO TELL A PLANE 
VL-solwheim 2234.28 2237.60 s0001 STOP OR PULL UP OR GO AROUND SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
VL-solwheim 2237.61 2239.92 s0001 AND OF COURSE A LOT OF IT IS MILITARY 
VL-solwheim 2239.92 2243.85 s0001 USE I DON'T DO THAT THAT SIDE OF ITS OR 
VL-solwheim 2243.86 2247.55 s0001 BUT YES STREAM PROCESSING IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY SOURCE 
VL-solwheim 2254.07 2255.49 s0001 UM 
VL-solwheim 2255.50 2258.04 s0001 WELL THE THE FELLOW WHO DESIGNED THIS 
VL-solwheim 2258.04 2264.61 s0001 AND AND MYSELF WE COME FROM OR MACHINE LEARNING BACKGROUND SO WE USE ALL THE STANDARD STATISTICAL METHODS 
VL-solwheim 2264.61 2265.83 s0001 AND 
VL-solwheim 2265.84 2268.42 s0001 YOU KNOW A LOT OF IT IS COMPARING IT TO 
VL-solwheim 2268.42 2270.54 s0001 TWO UP OTHER METHODS 
VL-solwheim 2270.55 2273.00 s0001 SO PARTICULARLY NEURAL NETWORK METHODS 
VL-solwheim 2273.01 2278.49 s0001 BUT IT'S ALL THE REGULAR WAYS IN IN THIS PAPER WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGIES 
VL-solwheim 2278.50 2281.62 s0001 A FACT A SYSTEM'S ABILITY TO RESPOND 
VL-solwheim 2281.62 2287.12 s0001 HOW HOW HOW WELL THEY ARE RESPONDING IN HERE IT'S JUST THAT IT IS THE CLASSIC THING WITH A 
VL-solwheim 2287.12 2288.46 s0001 YOU KNOW A TENFOLD 
VL-solwheim 2288.46 2290.68 s0001 A CROSS VALIDATION AND SO FORTH 
VL-solwheim 2290.69 2297.39 s0001 GENERALLY SPEAKING ALL OF THESE SYSTEMS SO AS NOT TO VIDEO MOTION DETECTION OF THE SHELLS WERE VALIDATED AGAINST THE MACHINE LEARNING 
VL-solwheim 2297.40 2298.98 s0001 A TEST SETS IN THE 
VL-solwheim 2298.98 2300.04 s0001 I THINK THE 
VL-solwheim 2300.06 2301.90 s0001 M. I. T. REPOSITORY 
VL-solwheim 2351.15 2352.75 s0001 NO 
VL-solwheim 2352.76 2359.56 s0001 NO IT DID THERE'S UM WITH THIS KIND OF SYSTEM ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE ARE USED FOR A LOT OF THINGS OUT YOU LOOK INTO THE LITERATURE 
VL-solwheim 2359.57 2363.55 s0001 THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN USE THE G. A. OR A NEURAL NETWORK FOR PEOPLE HAVE NOT TRIED THIS APPROACH 
VL-solwheim 2363.56 2365.79 s0001 BUT IN TERMS OF ACTIVE LEARNING 
VL-solwheim 2365.79 2370.84 s0001 UM BUT AGAIN THE A. B. M. D. IS IT IS A GREAT EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S WATCHING 
VL-solwheim 2370.85 2375.25 s0001 ANY IT'S IT'S BUILDING ITS OWN SENSE OF WHAT OUR BEHAVIOURAL PRIMITIVES 
VL-solwheim 2375.26 2377.27 s0001 WITHOUT ANY INTERVENTION 
VL-solwheim 2377.28 2383.59 s0001 AND IT IS ACTUALLY KIND OF A LOT OF LEARNING FACE IN THE SENSE THAT EVERYTHING THAT LEARNING GOES INTO THE POSITIVE SEPT 
VL-solwheim 2383.60 2388.16 s0001 AND WHEN THAT FREEZES OVER ANYTHING THAT DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THAT 
VL-solwheim 2388.17 2393.17 s0001 MINSKY'S CONSIDERED ANOMALY AND THERE'S A BIG QUESTION ABOUT OVER FITTING YOU CAN IMAGINE 
VL-solwheim 2393.17 2396.29 s0001 A REALLY GOOD WAY TO DO THIS IF YOU HAD AN A. I. S. SYSTEM IS JUST 
VL-solwheim 2396.30 2401.32 s0001 HE'S JUST SHRINK WRAP IT IN PLASTIC IN ANYTHING OUTSIDE THAT WOULD BE AN ANOMALY 
VL-solwheim 2401.33 2403.86 s0001 BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE 
VL-solwheim 2403.86 2407.11 s0001 AT THE AT THE AT THE IRIS SAT 
VL-solwheim 2407.12 2410.79 s0001 YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE THREE CLASSES OF THINGS THAT ARE COMPLETELY INTERTWINED 
VL-solwheim 2410.80 2415.01 s0001 DESIGNING BE ANYWAY TO ME YOU KNOW TO WRAP THESE TOGETHER 
VL-solwheim 2416.21 2418.30 s0001 AH YES 
VL-solwheim 2423.31 2425.04 s0001 SEE 
VL-solwheim 2426.54 2430.64 s0001 SO IT'S IT'S AGAIN IT'S A DIFFICULT PROBLEM IF BUT IF YOU HAVE 
VL-solwheim 2430.65 2433.35 s0001 FOR EXAMPLE A TWO CLASS PROBLEM AND THEY ARE 
VL-solwheim 2433.36 2437.11 s0001 ABSOLUTELY DIVISIBLE THEN THEN THE SYSTEM DOES WHAT YOU THINK IT WILL DO 
VL-solwheim 2437.12 2438.96 s0001 THE KIND OF WRAPS THEM SEPARATELY 
VL-solwheim 2438.96 2442.35 s0001 A A AND CITY IN THE CASE OF THE IRIS AS 
VL-solwheim 2442.36 2450.07 s0001 IT IS ABSTRACTING SOME SORT OF BASIC IDEA ABOUT WHERE INDY BODY SHOULD GO TO BE VERY GOOD DETECTORS 
VL-solwheim 2451.56 2458.25 s0001 AH I THINK THESE ARE NOT SOME OF THESE LIKE THE IRIS THEY'RE GOOD EXAMPLES BECAUSE THEY'RE ILLUSTRATED BUT THEY DON'T SHOW 
VL-solwheim 2458.25 2462.96 s0001 HOW MANY CLASSES OF PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO APPLY HERE 
VL-solwheim 2463.05 2470.33 s0001 A CAMERA WAS WATCHING THIS ROOM AND THERE'S REALLY A LOT OF THINGS WE COULD DO THAT WOULD BE UNUSUAL A LOT OF STRANGE BEHAVIOURS 
VL-solwheim 2470.34 2473.85 s0001 AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT A B. M. Z. AND 
VL-solwheim 2473.86 2477.50 s0001 ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS EXCEL AT IS LOOKING FOR THINGS ARE REALLY WEIRD 
VL-solwheim 2477.50 2479.67 s0001 IT'S VERY GOOD FOR ANOMALY DETECTION 
VL-solwheim 2479.67 2485.50 s0001 IF I IF I WERE BUILDING THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS TODAY I PROBABLY WOULD BE TAKING SOME OF THE IDEAS ABOUT THIS 
VL-solwheim 2485.51 2488.53 s0001 AND I'D BE APPLYING THEM IN OTHER MACHINE LEARNING SETTINGS 
VL-solwheim 2488.54 2490.17 s0001 THE BUILDING THE SYSTEM FOR 
VL-solwheim 2490.19 2491.96 s0001 FUN AND THEN APPLYING IT TO 
VL-solwheim 2491.96 2494.83 s0001 DIFFICULT PROBLEMS ARE PROBABLY WOULD LOOK AT THE DIFFICULT PROBLEM 
VL-solwheim 2494.83 2498.60 s0001 BUILD A SOLUTION AND THEN I WOULD TAKE SOME OF THESE IDEAS 
VL-solwheim 2498.60 2502.04 s0001 ABOUT HOW ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS WORK AND APPLY THEM 
VL-solwheim 2502.05 2506.34 s0001 I WAS ACTUALLY SOME VERY INTERESTING MATHEMATICS INVOLVED IN MORPHOLOGY 
VL-solwheim 2506.35 2507.65 s0001 AND REPRESENTATION 
VL-solwheim 2507.66 2509.56 s0001 SO YOU KNOW HOW BIG 
VL-solwheim 2509.57 2511.53 s0001 AH HOW BIG IS AN ANTIBODY 
VL-solwheim 2511.54 2514.07 s0001 I WILL CAN ADAPT DOES IT HAVE MATHEMATICALLY 
VL-solwheim 2514.07 2517.48 s0001 WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN AN ANTIBODY FOLDS 
VL-solwheim 2517.50 2521.85 s0001 SO IMAGINE AN ANTIBODY THAT IS ABLE TO GRAB A HOLD OF SOMETHING 
VL-solwheim 2521.86 2526.33 s0001 AND WRAPPED ITS DATA SENSING ARMS AROUND AN ANTIGEN 
VL-solwheim 2526.34 2529.73 s0001 HOW DOES IT DO THAT FOLDING AND THIS IS ACTUALLY KIND OF HOW 
VL-solwheim 2529.73 2532.91 s0001 IMMUNOLOGY WORKS IN BIOLOGY SO IT'S NOT JUST 
VL-solwheim 2532.92 2535.77 s0001 STRINGS BUMPING AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A MATTER THEY DO 
VL-solwheim 2535.78 2538.03 s0001 THERE'S AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL MORPHOLOGY 
VL-solwheim 2538.04 2539.42 s0001 AND THAT CAN CHANGE 
VL-solwheim 2539.42 2540.60 s0001 AND UM 
VL-solwheim 2540.61 2544.04 s0001 THIS THIS IDEA OF THE COMPUTATIONAL 
VL-solwheim 2544.05 2547.11 s0001 ABILITIES OF SYSTEMS THAT CHANGE THEIR PHYSICAL 
VL-solwheim 2547.11 2548.48 s0001 INSTANTIATION 
VL-solwheim 2548.48 2553.60 s0001 YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S NOW A SUB FIELD IN COMPUTER SCIENCE CALLED MORPHOLOGICAL COMPUTATION 
VL-solwheim 2553.62 2555.46 s0001 A THAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH 
VL-solwheim 2555.46 2556.37 s0033 HMMM 
VL-solwheim 2559.16 2560.75 s0033 YOU USED TO 
VL-solwheim 2560.77 2562.37 s0033 MISSIONS WHERE ARE YOU 
VL-solwheim 2571.88 2573.68 s0033 YEAH YOU 
VL-solwheim 2574.90 2578.67 s0001 A LOT OF THESE ARE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS I I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS 
VL-solwheim 2578.67 2583.57 s0001 AND IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE THE SECURITY GUARD IN A BIG BUILDING OR CAMPUS 
VL-solwheim 2583.58 2590.73 s0001 INSTEAD OF WATCHING MONITORS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY SHOWING A LIVE UPDATE OF PEOPLE SMOKING CIGARETTES DOWNSTAIRS 
VL-solwheim 2590.75 2593.23 s0001 IT ONLY SHOWS YOU THINGS SUSPICIOUS 
VL-solwheim 2593.25 2594.66 s0001 AND OUR TWO BIG BUTTONS 
VL-solwheim 2594.67 2600.56 s0001 AND YOU PUSH THE RED ONE AND IT WILL DISPATCH PEOPLE TO GO LOOK INTO IT IN THE GREEN ONE MEANS NO THIS WAS OKAY 
VL-solwheim 2600.57 2603.51 s0001 UM REMOVE THE ANTI BODIES 
VL-solwheim 2603.51 2607.18 s0001 BUT FOUND THIS UNUSUAL SO YOU CAN ALSO GO WITH THE OTHER WAY WITH THE LEARNING 
VL-solwheim 2607.19 2610.85 s0001 SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE REAL USE IN A TRAFFIC SETTING 
VL-solwheim 2610.85 2614.77 s0001 AH FOR EXAMPLE THAT WOULD THEY TESTED THE SYSTEM IN BELGIUM 
VL-solwheim 2614.79 2618.41 s0001 AND IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO BELGIUM IF YOU'VE EVER DRIVEN IN BRUSSELS YOU KNOW THAT 
VL-solwheim 2618.42 2621.66 s0001 THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE ONLY TECHNICALLY DRIVING A CAR 
VL-solwheim 2621.66 2627.10 s0001 I MEAN YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY IN THE SENSE THAT I'M DRIVING I WON'T HIT THINGS THERE'S NONE OF THAT 
VL-solwheim 2627.10 2629.97 s0001 UM BELGIANS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE I'D IN WHERE 
VL-solwheim 2629.98 2633.06 s0001 YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE ROAD AND YOU SAY OH LOOK CAR ON FIRE 
VL-solwheim 2633.07 2636.67 s0001 ANOTHER CAR ON FIRE YOU KNOW THIS CARS OFF THE ROAD 
VL-solwheim 2636.68 2640.85 s0001 THEN IN BELGIUM WHAT THEY DECIDED WAS YES WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT EVERYONE WHO'S SPEAKING 
VL-solwheim 2640.85 2645.14 s0001 WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO LOOK FOR OUR CARS THAT HAVE GONE OFF THE ROAD CATASTROPHICALLY 
VL-solwheim 2645.15 2647.12 s0001 THINGS ON FIRE 
VL-solwheim 2647.13 2649.35 s0001 AND NO ACTIVITY 
VL-solwheim 2649.36 2652.29 s0001 SO HERE YOU HAVE KIND OF A FOUR CLASS PROBLEM 
VL-solwheim 2652.30 2653.43 s0001 THINGS ON FIRE 
VL-solwheim 2653.43 2659.12 s0001 AH NO ACTIVITY WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS ALL THE CARS ARE STOPPED FOR SOME REASON AND THINGS THAT HAVE GONE OFF THE ROAD 
VL-solwheim 2659.13 2663.84 s0001 AND CONSIDERING HOW MANY CAMERAS THERE ARE NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS ACTUALLY A REALLY PRETTY GOOD 
VL-solwheim 2663.84 2664.96 s0001 APPLICATION 
VL-solwheim 2664.97 2669.58 s0001 UM I THINK IN THE UNITED STATES YOU YOU WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO USE THIS KIND OF SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 2669.60 2671.55 s0001 FOR ROUTINE TRAFFIC 
VL-solwheim 2671.56 2673.15 s0001 I MEAN IT'S 
VL-solwheim 2674.31 2675.35 s0001 IT IS 
VL-solwheim 2675.35 2676.13 s0033 ONE WAY 
VL-solwheim 2677.37 2679.20 s0033 THE GUY BODY EXPLICITLY 
VL-solwheim 2687.14 2688.90 s0033 ALSO ON ANOTHER QUESTION 
VL-solwheim 2689.20 2691.33 s0033 RELATED TO THAT SO THEY 
VL-solwheim 2693.04 2694.78 s0033 SO THESE 
VL-solwheim 2695.02 2696.86 s0033 GOOD BET THAT THEY 
VL-solwheim 2698.20 2700.14 s0033 AND SO ON BUT A 
VL-solwheim 2700.15 2701.53 s0033 AND THEN 
VL-solwheim 2701.54 2702.93 s0033 A NOMINEE 
VL-solwheim 2702.94 2703.89 s0033 THESE THINGS 
VL-solwheim 2703.89 2704.42 s0001 BUT 
VL-solwheim 2707.62 2710.52 s0001 YEAH BUT THE SHELL SYSTEM WE DESIGNED THIS ONE 
VL-solwheim 2710.53 2715.26 s0001 USES TRY GRAMS TO TAKE APART TAXED SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEDING IN 
VL-solwheim 2715.27 2719.94 s0001 ANY ARBITRARY TWO STRINGS AND IT WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW SIMILAR THEY ARE 
VL-solwheim 2719.94 2724.97 s0001 UM IT ALSO HAD A DATABASE OF CALM IN A CATEGORICAL DECLARATIVE SO 
VL-solwheim 2724.98 2728.53 s0001 SO YOU COULD SAY A HIS BLOOD PRESSURE WAS SOMETHING SOMETHING 
VL-solwheim 2728.53 2730.19 s0001 WHICH I CONSIDERED HIGH 
VL-solwheim 2730.20 2733.83 s0001 AND IT WOULD PICK UP BLOOD PRESSURE HIGH WOULD THROW AWAY ALL THE OTHER GARBAGE 
VL-solwheim 2733.85 2737.40 s0001 THEN WOULD BEGIN TO SHIP THAT BACK INTO THE FUZZY CLASSIFY OR 
VL-solwheim 2737.40 2740.74 s0001 I WAS ABLE TO DO A LOT OF THE KIND OF BACK AND TEXT MINING 
VL-solwheim 2740.74 2747.16 s0001 BUT AS YOU SAY IN THE SPEEDING EXAMPLE LIKE IN BELGIUM NO ONE I'VE EVER SEEN ANYONE GO SPEED LIMIT HOW WOULD YOU TRAIN IT 
VL-solwheim 2747.16 2749.85 s0001 AND THE ANSWER IS YOU PROBABLY WOULD 
VL-solwheim 2749.86 2751.93 s0001 YOU WOULD CREATE A PHONY 
VL-solwheim 2751.94 2757.33 s0001 TESTS AT TRAIN IT REMOVE IT AND THEN THE ANTIBODIES WE JUST SIT AND WATCH FOR THIS BEHAVIOR 
VL-solwheim 2757.34 2761.80 s0001 OR IF YOU HAD ACCESS TO THE THE CELLULAR AUTOMATON THE MATHEMATICS 
VL-solwheim 2761.81 2763.88 s0001 YOU FORGET ABOUT THE ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 2763.89 2766.40 s0001 AND YOU WOULD JUST USE STATISTICAL METHODS 
VL-solwheim 2766.41 2768.58 s0001 IN THE CELLULAR AUTOMATA LAYER 
VL-solwheim 2768.60 2771.82 s0001 BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY THE THING THAT'S DOING THE UM 
VL-solwheim 2771.83 2773.85 s0001 IN SOME WAYS THE LOGIC OF WHAT 
VL-solwheim 2773.86 2775.84 s0001 CONSTITUTES A BEHAVIORAL PRIMITIVE 
VL-solwheim 2775.85 2777.64 s0001 AND THEN SENDING IT FORWARD 
VL-solwheim 2779.33 2782.78 s0001 AN INTERESTING THING IN MORPHOLOGICAL COMPUTING 
VL-solwheim 2782.79 2785.38 s0001 WHICH WERE KIND OF TALKING ABOUT HERE 
VL-solwheim 2785.39 2788.85 s0001 I MET SOME PEOPLE IN SWEDEN AND THEY HAD BEEN LOOKING AT JELLYFISH 
VL-solwheim 2788.86 2793.51 s0001 AND THEY HAVE A JELLYFISH THAT HAS THIRTY TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF EYES 
VL-solwheim 2793.51 2796.79 s0001 AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT HAS WON THE BIG GUY 
VL-solwheim 2796.80 2800.20 s0001 THAT IS VERY GOOD AT FOCUSING AMERICAN REALLY SEE 
VL-solwheim 2800.21 2805.77 s0001 WHAT IT DOES IS IT PERFORMS ITS LANDS TO CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION COMING INTO ITS SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 2805.78 2809.62 s0001 BECAUSE IT'S IT'S PHYSIOLOGY IS SUCH THAT IT CAN'T REALLY SEE ANYWAY 
VL-solwheim 2809.62 2814.71 s0001 PRESENTS I THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY VERY GOOD AT WHAT IT'S DOING IS IT'S COMPRESSING 
VL-solwheim 2814.71 2816.41 s0001 USING ITS UM 
VL-solwheim 2816.42 2817.93 s0001 MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES 
VL-solwheim 2817.94 2821.22 s0001 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I AM A JELLYFISH AND I WANNA LOOK ONLY AT YOU 
VL-solwheim 2821.22 2823.76 s0001 I DON'T USE NEUROLOGICAL METHODS 
VL-solwheim 2823.77 2828.19 s0001 TO MASK OUT EVERYTHING ELSE USING SOCIAL ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY 
VL-solwheim 2828.20 2831.93 s0001 I I CHANGE MY THE MORPHOLOGY THE LANDS 
VL-solwheim 2831.93 2834.73 s0001 SO LITERALLY PHYSICALLY THE ONLY THING I SEE IS YOU 
VL-solwheim 2834.74 2837.10 s0001 WHICH IS A VERY INTERESTING WAY UP 
VL-solwheim 2837.11 2839.81 s0001 CHANGING THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IS GOING IN AND OUT OF THE SYSTEM 
VL-solwheim 2839.82 2841.53 s0001 USING MORPHOLOGY 
VL-solwheim 2845.76 2849.06 s0001 AND ACTUALLY THE IMMUNE SYSTEM METAPHORS DOING THE SAME THING 
VL-solwheim 2849.07 2850.99 s0001 IT'S DOING A LOT WITH A LITTLE 
VL-solwheim 2851.00 2853.13 s0001 HOW YOU DISTRIBUTE FEATURES 
VL-solwheim 2853.14 2859.21 s0001 I'M ON A HUNDRED THOUSAND ANTI BODIES OF AN ARBITRARY COMPLEXITIES REALLY DIFFICULT 
VL-solwheim 2859.22 2860.58 s0001 CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM 
VL-solwheim 2860.59 2862.01 s0001 IN SOME WAYS 
VL-solwheim 2868.80 2873.79 s0001 UM HERE WHAT WE'RE USING WE WE HAVE BEEN USING A VERY COMMON 
VL-solwheim 2873.79 2878.75 s0001 I THINK WHEN WE BUILT THIS WE'RE USING G. D. P. C. CONNECTIVITY FOR THE SOFTWARE SIDE 
VL-solwheim 2878.76 2883.09 s0001 AND WE WERE EITHER BUILDING A CUSTOM REPRESENTATION FOR THE PROBLEM 
VL-solwheim 2883.09 2885.12 s0001 FOR IT WAS JUST BUILDING ONE 
VL-solwheim 2885.13 2886.83 s0001 YOU KNOW FROM SCRATCH 
VL-solwheim 2886.84 2891.14 s0001 SO THIS SYSTEM HERE WAS JUST USING I THINK HASH TABLES TO BRING IN THE DATA 
VL-solwheim 2891.15 2892.47 s0001 AND IT WAS 
VL-solwheim 2892.47 2894.27 s0001 YOU KNOW JUST PROCESSING IT 
VL-solwheim 2894.27 2898.70 s0001 SO THERE WAS NOT A FORMAL REPRESENTATION AS AS MY RECOGNISE IT 
VL-solwheim 2899.17 2903.26 s0001 NOW FOR SOME OF THESE SYSTEM SO MUCH PREPROCESSING IS TAKING PLACE 
VL-solwheim 2903.26 2908.96 s0001 BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE REPRESENTATION IT AT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT STAGES PARTICULARLY WITH A VIDEO CAMERA 
VL-solwheim 2908.97 2914.27 s0001 BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SO MUCH INFORMATION COMING IN THAT IS MISLEADING AND AS EXTRANEOUS AND HIS NOISY 
VL-solwheim 2914.27 2916.78 s0001 THESE SYSTEMS TEND TO BE VERY GOOD AH 
VL-solwheim 2916.78 2918.54 s0001 ADD NOISE 
VL-solwheim 2921.10 2928.38 s0001 I ASKED THE FELLOWS WHO WERE WHO WERE DOING A JET ENGINE DIAGNOSTICS WHAT'S THE STRANGEST THING 
VL-solwheim 2928.39 2929.85 s0001 YOU EVER SAW 
VL-solwheim 2929.86 2931.52 s0001 AN AIRPLANE 
VL-solwheim 2931.94 2935.94 s0001 YET YOU KNOW SO WHAT THEY BROUGHT YOU AN ENGINE AND IT WAS BROKEN 
VL-solwheim 2935.95 2937.28 s0001 WHAT WAS THE REASON 
VL-solwheim 2937.28 2938.61 s0001 AND AH 
VL-solwheim 2938.62 2942.33 s0001 THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD A PLANE COME IN FROM BRITISH AIR 
VL-solwheim 2942.33 2944.32 s0001 AND IT HAD A RABBIT 
VL-solwheim 2944.38 2946.55 s0001 SUCKED INTO THE ENGINE 
VL-solwheim 2946.56 2947.93 s0001 WHEN IT WAS UP 
VL-solwheim 2947.93 2950.56 s0001 A FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED FEET 
VL-solwheim 2951.35 2954.19 s0001 AND HOW DID THE RABBIT GET INTO THE ENGINE 
VL-solwheim 2954.20 2956.74 s0001 IT WAS DROPPED BY A BIG BIRD 
VL-solwheim 2956.74 2958.66 s0001 THAT WAS SCARED OF THE PLANE 
VL-solwheim 2958.73 2961.23 s0001 AND THAT DESTROYED THE ENGINE THIS RABBIT
