Description
Artificial immune systems are a newly emerging paradigm for distributed machine learning 
that takes its organisational and representational cues from the human immune system and 
applies it to difficult error and anomaly detection across a variety of problems. The talk 
will be general in nature, and introduce basic concepts and applications including the use 
of AIS in network and physical security.
