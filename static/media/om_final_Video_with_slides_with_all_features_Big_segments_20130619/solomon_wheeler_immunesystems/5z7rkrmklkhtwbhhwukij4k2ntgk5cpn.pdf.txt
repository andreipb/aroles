This Presentation45 Minutes feel free to ask questions at any timeDescribe basic concepts and research in artificial immune systems (AIS) and show some applied examplesAIS for applied knowledge engineering (biological metaphors, not biological modeling)For a general scientific audienceComputerScienceMathematics/InformationTheoryEngineeringArtificialIntelligenceBiology &ChemistryCognitiveScienceNon-SymbolicAISymbolicAImachine learningGeneticAlgorithmsNeuralNetworksArtificial Immune Systemscomputation and machine learning based on biological

Slide 2
ImmunologyFacts about the human immune system:A highly complex massively parallel and distributed system maintaining both innate (non-specific)and acquired (specific)defenses for the purpose of defense and self/non-self discriminationLymphocytes and phagocytes are the cellular building blocksLymphocytes (B and T cells) created in the thymus and bone marrow interact with antigens(things perceived as foreign to the body) and through recognitioncause an immune responseB and T Cells have around 100,000 receptors to match a single pathogen, with 10^12in the human body!Human lymphocyteLymphocyte killing tumor cell
---------
Slide 3
ImmunologyAn immune response includes the cloning of activated B cells, with some identical, and some slightly different offspringAntibodies recognize dangerous antigens through a complex matching and interaction process in their Once a foreign antigen is recognized, an immunological memoryis created, which is the basis for modern vaccinationKey concepts: matching, cloning, morphology, negative selection, self/non-self discrimination (Parham 2000)B CellCloningMatchingBindingImmunization

Slide 5
How Do You Build Them?Like many AI systems, AISs are a technique for learning and reacting to an environmentChoose an environment to monitorInterface data to AISbe automatically created from test dataAntibody profiles are automatically created
---------
Slide 6
AIS as Semi-Unsupervised Classifier (needs no negative examples) with Continuous LearningAntibodies are created at random or using a genetic algorithmAntibodies too closely normal system states are killed off during trainingDuring monitoring the environment (represented as antigens) is compared to the self (represented as antibodies)According to immunological 
---------
Slide 7
How do they react?an immune responseWhich may store the warning, contact an administrator, or react automaticallyImmune response may also include the generation or network dissemination of advanced antibodies or clones with even better detection skills providing acquired immunity
---------
Slide 8
Database ofanimals inthe zooWhat Are the Basics?  RepresentationAISs systems in software are usually built like this:Decide upon a representation of the problem domain (direct, binary, symbolic, fuzzy) and solution ranges, and establish communication standards for the environment monitored (all examples in this presentation are taken from the AIAI AIS Shell System)ZOO.DBHow can we protect the animals in a zoo (database) when we are introducing new, unknown animals?
---------
Slide 9
Basics: Database of AntibodiesCreate an initial population of antibodies either randomly or using statistical or GA methods and remove antibodies too Creation ofantibodydatabaseautoimmunity is the failure of an organism to recognize its own constituent parts as self, which allows an immune response against its own cells and tissues.ANTIBODIESANTIBODIES
---------
Slide 10
Monitor the environment (which creates data samples for learning), and remove any antibodies which match the environment samples too closelyAs in other ML methods, we are looking for the smallest collection of AIS, too many antibodies = overfitting.Database of environmental knowledge = innate immunityBasics: Learning & MatchingANTIBODIESLearning of a normal environment
---------
Slide 11
After a suitable length of time, allow the remaining antibodies to begin monitoring their environment and generating an immune response when they match the environment too closelyenvironmentOKOKOK!!!!!Basics: Monitoring
---------
Slide 12
ANTIBODIESCreate clones and mutations of antibodies which caused an immune response and distribute them throughout the system; also create occasional random new antibodies and introduce them into the populationWarn UserWARNINGSLogWarningsGenerateClonesRemote ServerDistributedAntibodiesAcquired ImmunityImmuneresponseBasics: Immune Response?
