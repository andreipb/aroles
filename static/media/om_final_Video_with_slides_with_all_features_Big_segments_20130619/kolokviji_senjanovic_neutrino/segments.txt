the speaker is a professor go tossing a knowledge 

um he did his bachelor status in belgrade yugoslavia about time 

and in his busy at 

ah the city university of new york and united states 

he worked at brookhaven national lab 

and a brief lead 

universe as a group 

and then he moved to the international centre for theoretical physics 

um intestine could only 

he founded a group for phenomenology of elementary particles at high city p. 

and his speciality 

or his to have or cares so um 

theoretical physics of fill in elementary particles

 

now he's a well known for his work on neutrinos 

he proposed no seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass 

and he did a pioneering work 

on left right symmetry models 

his coauthor of over a hundred papers 

ah 

many many citations over eleven hundred eleven thousand 

and today he's going through 

tell us about the in a neutrino paradigm and what we can learn 

about the neutrino paradigm 

a from experiments have 

the large hadron collider 

oh 

thanks a lot 

it's a real pleasure 

yeah i'm an old friend of his sister and i mean here many times 

give a number of thoughts now it turns out that i gave a call log human here ten years ago 

i wonder if there is some of you there 

some are usually i mean there 

i spoke of the tree nuts 

the thing is i suppose to play a great laws and cosmology they don't do that as much as we hold 

i'll try to argue the neutrino surprisingly play a great 

great role at the late shia that l. a. c. this machine that i am sure 

all of your courage to find the higgs particle ride escorts 

by legal as they call it 

can actually be a machine 

to probe the nature of neutrinos and the original three namaste 

now the title here 

it's not my type that i was ordered last summer it's of u. s. special glaucoma cern 

said use this title okay and i've been using it ever since i'm not sure is the right title 

but i did notice i've been preaching this for a while 

and then that 

there has been a change in the last couple of years people are more more willing to 

listen that they seasonal just machine to find the higgs and 

so called extra dimensions and blow holes

 

so let's let's start 

now do you 

today we had a standard model i hope you have all heard of that 

it's eerie all the particle 

interactions elementary particle interactions 

there is basil symmetries i won't talk so much about the symmetries their local geisha mentors whatever that means 

and i say all the interactions are mean all interactions by gravity 

simply because varied is negligible 

by many many orders of magnitude should then we talk over the world of elementary particles so you may ask 

now why in the world that's carried a matter then 

why does met a guy with a 

and the answer again i'm sure 

i should i hope it leads the first five ten 

chris perez is you'll 

know what i'm talking about 

well because the celestial object 

i have many many 

elementary particles 

having zero charge very vision becomes the main ports well i can safely 

ignore gravitation when i speak of the micro world 

that's what i do for the rest so much so 

this theme is i said that either litigated through title

 

hester the movie they're left rice in today's the first amended a child sees right is the symmetry of the images in the mirror 

i want to tell you 

that this could be a 

fundamental symmetry nature 

and the the large hadron collider lacy could does that 

now 

elementary particles have there 

characteristics 

is all of us their mask 

they have charge or they may not have child 

and they have spain right just like her they keep spinning they have swore these are ninety moment of interest 

and in quantum mechanics payments i don't mean digits 

sometimes the original 

fundamental spinoff off

 

the only thing we really have to know about the screen in this talk 

and a particularly interesting objects are the particles their screen one half crazy and it is a matter now you all all dead 

let's say on these a 

transfer as you all know that the world is made out of atoms which is made out of a nucleus and the electrons going around 

and then you all know then okay this is made out of protons and neutrons 

they have skin one hot 

because the firm the answer 

protozoa positively charging orders a neutral the name tells you 

i want you to remember and this funny unit okay we use crazy unit in particle physics when i ride genie just remember that's the mass of proton and neutron 

a very tiny mass 

and of course electron which is basically massless um two thousand times lighter than india 

now in nineteen twenty eight dereck rights in equation a 

quantum mechanical 

if your wishes training godiva equation for fast moving 

particles and find that the screen is inbuilt there was one knows the magical things that emerged

 

for his work now also you all know 

the frozen rose i made out of a sits right 

invented bytes wide 

in nineteen sixty four is a series of paper and worked out 

in a quarry today 

although they're made out races 

so the brother is supposed to be made out of 

to a base is one donates 

they actually colourful objects they come in different colors know drawn to be a little different to down one up

 

and of course um she's got a key these guys together will talk about it 

this is this is these are the messengers 

every force has its own messenger 

in the case so quartz there will be 

objects it recalled rules igloo them together 

and as we speak they keep doing us together 

you'll or they're made of the laces 

actually it 

shows you that if you don't do the original brokerages an original name 

so i'm sure all of you heard that they're made out of quartz 

it's interesting government even take them seriously 

the idea that they're walk say he abandon it immediately trichet pursuing this 

he never even though the nobel prize for that

 

which is maybe the most important work in in more than particle physics to us 

now these and other here's our thought hungary's electron 

proton and what's wrong the hero will be neutrino the lightest a wall and mentor particle carries no charge 

it's a mysterious 

object the keys robotic us as we speak 

coming from the sun then 

whereas from

 

and as i was saying you know they think about particle physics losses that interactions have these messages this was a photon 

just a little more we awhile 

how an electronic directed another electron 

it's simply emits the photo on as you have seen as a messenger electromagnetic force 

and the other allegory sees it and therefore that's why they're in scatter 

and adjusts passed by each other 

what we do you see this is a picture i showed you before i was elected all 

this is precisely what he so the who 

before in a in an interesting paper which was impossible to really nineteen forty eight 

in a in the appendix feynman 

develops a set of rules 

to tells you not only how to the big these processes okay this is what i've showed you in a little more we're idyllic from comes in 

it's falling in this direction it stays an electron emits a photon that the other guy 

does and the most important role off 

feynman laser understanding 

this was is the cornerstone of 

one in particle physics you should never do other than here was later corrected you cannot break the furby on it like if you do 

that would be a so so you perform physics okay 

so please e. game 

and then throwing it is direction would be a positron an opposite to touch particle moving in the other direction okay

 

so it can serve as a nice message don't break this line is that it 

so when i tell you that we know 

the forces the data together 

consistent theory 

been all the messengers of resources we know the properties okay there is the photon a message or electromagnetic force 

there are 

glaus remember the guys that are doing us together 

that walks inside us 

there are eight of them it turns out they're similar to fort on they're supposed to be massless
-----
 

and then there are these are the heroes together in a tree knows all story 

what we call the week cage was also responsible for 

radiated a case 

charge two of them w. plausibly minus and the neutron and they were harry 

remember this was a proton less 

some hundred times heavier 

in india 

the proto must now i think we can argue 

i'm sure most of my colleagues would agree that the more than particle physics starts three their bombshell of dereck's three years

 

after he wrote his equation 

new york shows 

that 

the attack actually shows dereck takes courage to say 

what was immediately clear to him and everybody else 

there must be 

and i particle and this is an amazing thing that came out the rule 

he writes immigration describes an electron 

he predicts that must be a positron and a positive charge particle with all the other same properties 

it was a little drama behind this is first ling 

because actually they were seen even before nineteen twenty three score belts in russia 

says 

he sees the particles reach our like electron 

but they move in the opposite direction in the

 

field 

he sees them from cosmic rays 

when we get photons annihilate into them 

it's even more interesting the story because in nineteen 

twenty nine registered and a caltech child actually 

because everybody that he sings them he's 

he's be hash down 

among many people including his senior calling under sun 

who in the dereck says that their entire particles quickly please the worker child

 

this guy even though the noble prize okay this is amazing 

so maybe there's a little message for younger people are not known 

don't be scared 

they tell you that what you're saying it's not there 

and with higher message for professor steve from the 

students that we can use them anywhere this is well known you can read about it 

wikipedia ticket testing nobel prize 

anyway as that 

i went on 

eventually they will be in and i brought on this carried will take some time and then one after another

 

for republicans we found an entire particle 

and this is probably the most beautiful thing one could argue our field 

there is a for every firm you know what i call spin one half 

particle 

a different end up either go from a body 

beautiful came out of low except 

they may not be true 

says my run 

he says that neutrino 

there will be our hero 

any carries no charge 

could be its own end of article 

okay the term i run a 

we'll write this paper it's the 

last paper we for his tragic disappearance 

i have to say a few words 

about him 

he needed a job

 

he wouldn't publish it is job he was 

getting a job in a pulley and they said if you want to get a job you have to write a paper so he takes out of a drawer 

one of the classical or maybe most important papers in our field 

and 

on march twenty six ninety sergei he disappears is is not even say two years old 

i gave o'clock in las vegas was war for people in the field it was on march twenty six every fascinating wire and i find it very nice it grants us a laboratory

 

i spoke on the day when he disappeared 

he took a ball from palermo 

when a pulley and was never seen afterwards in the legend who 

because the body was not found out 

and he retrieved by if you know anything about him there is a beautiful knowledge for those who leave french 

slightly answered fantasy nation by an american ball 

this installation was certain 

and it's what is surprising she's a she's a lady lady would lay more woman 

it's a beautiful even physics 

correctly describe beautiful no no 

this is all over 

search warmer and was never seen who so my around 

i want 

tell you 

it's interesting what fairy says of of my around and there are various types of scientific it says 

second sir drank do their bad long wharf argument over 

and you us 

pair first rank 

i'm a great discovery fundamental for development science he said and he's actually this is this is so that little crazy maybe he puts i stand there

 

read the boar 

kinds of air 

and then he says they're geniuses i galena you to try this surely we all agree to newton was one of the gators genius who was wire on a 

in that category consists elect common says 

he wouldn't publish 

i like to say this you know these days delivery publish only should let 

some common sense 

ah 

so i'll 

by setting the stage i'm paying into the sea number two which is going to be inter into the first one i want to understand the origin of this emitter told ruth 

the first image we see 

and then my runner working take me 

the beautiful subject re subtle means that i can create electrons out of nothing 

i'll be precise about that 

it's called neutrinos level be dedicated technical language adjusted a textbook 

and i want to show you that this is immediately after my run area dogging 

ah so this answer d. a.

 

some fifty years later or so we came up with the suggestion that this can be seen other call i there's i want to convince you that there you can actually probe inside the heart of that 

matter of my run a nature of particles 

much better than at low energies okay now why is this so special latrine 

it's funny to either special because they do like to interact with anybody 

the most a little fire because you can imagine

 

and so they say well why do care about them 

yes all over they could be pro bowl you physics because where there is zero a tiny effect can be very important 

so just to remind you 

hold fully you heard this story to tell you 

how in a three knows discovered 

picture they were invented the reading kelly by polly 

in nineteen thirty 

in so called better be cave in withdrawn was a slightly heavier the proton and electron together 

you can be cake in particle physics more or less you should remember that 

when they were allowed to decay you do 

so my heavy and then you and when it came to you 

if not to learn that there is some deep new physics okay 

so 

it was strange that there was no consideration of energy and even some people are willing to give it up he said 

why not imagine that there is a new particle 

he actually call it neutron 

because there was no neutron at a time 

and the name will be changed to neutrino little note wrong 

by a mahdi who suggest affair me who is the 

father of neutrino physics by large 

it's a kind of brother electron they always supposed to exist together 

mediatheque together so this is what a scene 

in those days 

right if no drum decays into a proton electron 

and this is happening in some nuclei having nuclear they'll move 

so alex was to take some six energy right the energy should be the line
-----
 

the difference between 

the images of the 

father and daughter 

nucleus and instead 

what a soul was a continuous spectrum 

any so that would be the most natural 

thing to suggest well that share 

the energy is being shared with other particles 

and it's interesting okay i have to mention is that the poly 

who suggested this is a letter that he writes to the colleagues 

in a meeting 

already activity day he calls it a desperate and maybe he's very apologetic is that introducing one your body go and he wants to be forgiven

 

as i speak 

some money sending a paper in my see in 

tar archive 

so just to get least five new particle and telling them they deserve simplest possible extension of the sun the picture 

so 

maybe they were too conservative but 

i could call these good old days you see there will be good old days and every more than times in my talk 

and it's interesting he can be in the meeting because he has a dance 

okay like that 

it's good that he wrote this letter writing because the rest is history now 

however despite it'll be seen 

it was very scary in the beginning had to mention that you could see because the way you would see 

the seed continuous process if i get it 

in the d. k. 

i should then 

to see that exists 

though dean was process right i skipped a proton

 

and then i'll get then 

no drawn to the positron right prado has a positive charge 

was it as a positive charge i just conserving physical processes 

the thing is that this guy doesn't wanna directed anybody the mean free pass that this doesn't mean that i was 

before he was either acted you enemies ten to the twenty centimeters right 

it's it's amazing 

and i think this helps understand john updike

 

the great american writer hope you know john updike many of you he's been dominating many times winnable prize he died 

he wrote this poem 

you can read there is no reason that i read for you 

notice he can stand 

it goes to you and me 

they enter in a pile and peers the lover and his girlfriend 

you call it wonderful i call it crass 

well this is maybe reported 

differs from from a physicist 

that's another interesting thing he knows they have no mass 

they they do have mass and it's not because 

there are no referees for ports any referee would have led is being published 

this was nineteen sixties 

then i started out my research i believe no reno has a mass for reasons i'll tell you later okay 

my friends are very worried 

my life was or it said look even the poison knows 

the neutrinos a must listen to what they're getting yourself into the earth 

so why they finally see that it was it took twenty six years it's a field that requires patience 

okay that 

the thing 

it always takes ten twenty years for the when you ideas that appears to twenty six years later

 

cornyn dryness view 

see note reno finally why because again 

reactors 

this is salary reactor you produce lot of them 

right so furious lot of them eventually you see if you went little bit 

number is huge 

there every second and square centimetres or get pen to this thirteen 

now that's a good old days 

for those of 

well i don't know i am i it's or mental colleagues here for them

 

little bit of teams you would see later 

they probably close enough 

this 

the text there 

you know what you do 

water is the best source of protons who just fill your that like the war there was small enough but only the skin is member of the collaboration could fit in 

the middle physicist and six technicians 

what 

will emerge it was an important for us is that 

there must be a message every said for every 

force right 

so if there is a four door for ago my metaphors 

i need m. s. c. share similar to for the record a double double ozone we've ozone 

who makes this process have been withdrawn emits 

this message or becomes a proton and then 

finally i gave his final state 

ah 

so you see this is the way it works again let me give you a little 

illustration 

when i say that would run the case i really mean that the aces the k. o. courses typically call them

 

the air inside these particles okay there lament early 

so i dunno drawn the these chords the gang into proton into a 

it does you see there was is down war 

that will become in a four way meeting a double of ozone 

it's a little simplified picture with words on 

and producing this final stage 

now 

for the 

main see you know i told you this is the 

second grain bombshell of particle physics 

these could also be a great one of the central steps in the development of particle physics 

is and these two young guys this is how they looked when they go the nobel prize

 

okay 

there were like close the thirtieth thing italy 

was a bombshell because everybody believed for the time that left thirteen that they had to be a good symmetry nature 

so in a company the suggestion 

that parody this parody every call the left are symmetries actually broken in weak interaction in this process that produces neutrinos

 

and it was turned out excrement a little bit rule 

the world was very excited 

what he meant that in these processes only left handed barrios that would interact as if the i would only read my left arm 

participate in that this is what they taught us 

ah 

they actually have a dream this is very interesting most people don oldies 

to the extent was forgotten by them for why 

maybe in the last quarter of the paper 

they actually suggest that deep down 

and the fundamental level 

they cannot believe that the symmetries broke and he has to be broken so logically 

how can it be that this imitative for symmetry see 

it's uh the fundamental similar nature seats it's 

i'm going to call it a union green 

so these are good old days there if i did another experiment 

it's all these stress she's called bumble there was a woman running the experiment 

she wasn't sure a result 

such as colleagues to check at this could be reason i should bigger than all the prize 

because this is an extraordinary thing right 

what happened is in the process of the 

neutron decay of the nucleus caldwell decay 

properly polarised this been

 

finding a direction you can do that with this been of the particle okay 

what they've seen the electrons wanted to go down 

and not symmetric ali if i define left and right 

not symmetrical are going up and up 

more so than actually what a scene is all of them would go 

only down 

so what that means that 

these questions year while it's parody strongly and it want to interact only the left niparko us 

or the left handed part of elementary particles like electoral 

and up and down for 

it took some time to for them to be recovered
-----
 

is a more than time there hunter said this and people this is interesting because of the minus one this is from my colleagues in the field right 

and interesting number on this 

is a it is now 

machines a little bigger 

i'll show it in a second okay just 

the sketch of that 

it's a now seven kilometers think of circumference machine 

and the reason that they needed a bigger machine you needed to accelerate a higher energies and for this you just need

 

more of running 

okay because these guys a about a hundred times more than the proton 

so obviously learned about them and you machine will be built 

left 

electron positron collider 

that's now is going to be really huge okay these are more than times 

you get fifteen hundred people before detectors 

twenty seven kilometre circumference 

failing to produce a billion of these guys okay 

so you wanna learn about this is why tell you that we have these standards theory understood in gory detail 

now there are 

as you can see a 

what is it sixteen years you can buy for 

this is just a sketch i'll show you a picture later this will be the 

new big machine 

this is how the old long look and that which is the injector for the 

for the big one now what is the my run a program okay that's come to the crux of the

 

subject we are asking he says neutrino could be an entire neutrino i mean just in case of beer 

which is an extraordinary simple equation 

relativistic quantum mechanical equation turned out that her they reach 

deep physics behind the same thing happens a case um i ran a 

if this is true what he says he can write them us term 

the neutrinos now allowed to have a mass 

even if it's fear left handed issue completely contradict for the are you 

and i came to explain this technicality here

 

who to you but the bottom line is 

you would mean you see then i call have sort of two neutrinos disappear 

or being created 

and since there 

but these are brothers electron the same thing 

what happened to the electron 

if my runners right 

and you happen like this 

i hope 

you can see these are five and diagrams we describe everything so feynman diagrams remember they just tell us what happens in a process 

this is a bit uh t. k. 

this is a better decay 

women were drawn becomes a proton by making a double of ozone these man electron 

and the neutrino 

some basic can happen 

because the daughter nucleus is heavier 

then the father one 

sure many am 

is light in an hour sending therefore he came 

the cake 

you ninety certify rush everything here mario get my realises 

you could have a double 

but that he came there because selenium resided injure menu 

in this case 

i can actually 

have a very rare process simultaneously two of these guys 

it takes a long time for this to happen 

now the subject my dog but it's probably longest 

we must be the longest lifetime ever measure 

takes about ten to the twenty years for this to happen 

not what we didn't 

what my runner tells us he breaks the rules that feynman 

told us and that i broke 

by mistake 

you can never break 

these for me on a klein 

unless you have my around i like particle which has to be neutral 

so is this is possible 

then 

i can break this line 

an hour ago the process you see which i'm getting electrons which i call americans out of nothing i have only 

nuclei that are producing electrons without these so bingo skewered by neutrinos which is the missing energy 

and that to happen of course only this guy has a mass 

came to my around them us 

so not to have read no tree knowledge that would be the t. k. i i call before this is

 

hardly technical language vision introduce a better name is a simultaneous 

the k. of 

to know draws 

you see each time and downpour becomes an up or gives you see this little maury 

the shining eyes a double bow zones 

each of them producing and i neutrinos i think is simply 

i now late if you wish 

figuratively 

speaking

 

they've been look for desperately mel for a long time 

is a more than times this is the experiment adjust either their number of them this a great i mean this kind of physics 

we usually in our feel a mentor father physics have to wait for decades often for you 

experiments and all of a sudden we're going to have a serious 

of this is look at these guys drive a detector is a little bigger 

in a few years they're going to tell us what is going on in the economy to the point of being able to test a series

 

these are really modern times 

okay this 

futuristic 

picture of the situation or 

but bear the the text or 

um 

so what is the standard one okay here's a telegraphic 

summary 

okay great prediction of the standard model great bud wrong 

and the mother 

invented by glacial weinberg and so are my eggs director who died prematurely and fortune 

from parkinson's 

these people develop this theory and one was cool showing this theory something that i myself found extremely annoying

 

bug me from the first day was interesting study the bucks a lot 

and this is the way this and the weather looks i'm not sure i'm sure you understand needed a new physics you don't have to 

i want you to pay attention to these completely left side the symmetric 

thankfully so 

whereas in the left and it sector okay because they have their left and right nature's the way 

we have left and right 

parts of our body 

the left and the guys they have to live together no to an electron 

the poor guy here is alone 

because there's no right handed neutrino 

it's true we have not seen this guy 

they write a theory saying it will ever be seen okay 

and therefore the mile run um us there 

cannot be written you see because these guy 

firstly the electrons as i write them i run a master um i'll have to write the electron must around but okay reese charge 

so i would have a violation of charge okay 

here i was 

so that 

okay i'm dilation of two 

neutrinos 

so they predicted entertainers massless okay 

people already suspected that annoys massless 

it's one of these strange dogmas you know people find in the number small and then decide these days very often more so my colleague steve their students

 

some days avon heard myself say that the default or should we must see them ever seen the folder wearing a mask 

it's very dangerous to make the same in writing in physics in science there are no zeros we should keep roving 

so neutrinos 

supposed to be my slaves and and the question 

why is the world metric 

i could stand this 

okay this is good 

azimi semi of this loan of the range 

i 

think this kind of a symmetry i could livid

 

it would bug me if here then inverleith here completely and i like to say that 

if you allow me 

i can believe that god maybe left 

and it 

she can be in 

just can't believe that 

i mean there 

ling you understand the model that the world is like that 

a symmetric and it always be 

now suppose that you want to have a cymatic world the way you would or we'd
-----
 

with basically sort of a 

just two weeks let's say nineties approach just make it symmetric 

take the gatz and say that the world is and i take and this is what they suggested that it didn't work it out they said that you probably want to party and so on 

and then we showed my mother and myself 

immediately afterwards that actually 

could be true 

they do good has this 

a symmetric 

the world could be completely symmetric 

which would mean that there must be if i believe 

in this kind of picture that there must be your gauge bows on when they were there is like 

there is right so there was another messenger 

why didn't i see 

well that's obvious 

it's not a it's a because it's heavy so and see 

that's what you say beginning but if you were reach these images

 

and of course you will see this another girl 

and the way an engine need is really imagine 

that the world is symmetric in the fullest sense suppose that you run into a situation like this 

okay this is called spontaneous symmetry breaking 

if i see is 

things like this i would say that the symmetries broken right 

there's no symmetry between left and right 

but of course can emerge 

from a completely symmetric situation because they were like this cannot exist this point is unstable right you don't wanna live

 

in a local maximum 

right you're going to fall down left to right and where you can fall down it's a completely free situation once you fall down 

you're breaking this image 

so what we mentioned in the symmetries continues to grow 

and you can be word thousand italy to a number of consequences it made is so called left isometric theories 

now there was a cursed this theory have icarus 

because the three no you see i said 

to you that the world had to be 

right cementing therefore neutrino is nuts 

very similar the electron 

so it'll be massive 

but everyone everybody knew they was massless and the limits there

 

telling as the muscle small so this was a curse 

it's a turn into a blessing 

when we realised 

it took some time 

amazing how this listing steak time 

often you're in the docking you're trying to develop a new theory 

because here's understand 

i can describe this technical about what happens is that they write any neutrino can by itself get my random us 

and it does get in in this theory 

just waking version 

i don't need to put left and right together i can have a completely broken

 

world in the end 

and so there is this heavy guy that some are being in contact 

me that tiny 

neutrino that we know and love 

gives it a little less 

let's see some mechanism 

one of the people that contributed this was gail monaghan his with the names he's been all his life or evelyn names okay he dealing write a paper do they can see it

 

just said a few lines in there 

the name caught up i wish i had chosen a name like this 

am i got himself from this is by calling it seems so people like me 

what turns out 

that this is i will be described here 

we know that had to be harry took many years to settle issues are how harry's been going on 

the study of this but you already in the early eighties 

they disguise remember this is a mass of the proton this unit

 

the w. was on that you found 

that s. p. s. and left 

they'd about a hundred times more than the proton arm in a completely different ballpark 

and therefore i myself for many years stopped 

really working on this seriously i had to give up on the possibility of seeing it 

because we knew we had to we were here 

these numbers change a little bit of last year 

beer is it didn't settle the issues

 

and what i can describe here is this year's of logical reasons that indicate that could be a day 

for people in the field 

and willing to discuss later 

this is work was done with me kind of bitterness t. 

my student a lot 

so now there is a fine 

since has again been dreaming about this in the early eighties finally actually sudden and seventies 

finally now there's a chance 

that's because seat in the machine okay so we have to find is bigger 

now me my what emerges is a subject in itself 

the neutrinos who have amassed so kate was found in and mining ship and indeed mine 

can be a car 

in a beautiful 

experimented was looking for a completely different 

matter it's called proton decay in

 

subject in itself 

it turned out that they 

all the neutrino has a very very tiny must know these orders of magnitude 

nine at least 

or there's a main cities billion times 

lighter than the proton and the reason that you now need this is very good differs detector with 

the scheme yes person could be inside 

now this is the 

super comic and the detector you know if the go

 

the boat to check your follow too 

bottom line 

you know that neutrinos must say no 

if a neutrino has a my randomized remembered there must be a process that i think is for 

feynman diagram 

and neutrinos level we dedicate this emergence 

electrons 

is there is left there is right that we notice immediately while part of therefore 

there'll be a complete and i love this situation now here this process is rare because neutrinos very light 

this one is rare because w. r. is heavier but they become 

so what we did we took it 

now that the ladies coming we took seriously this
-----
 

again with me how much within their fellow they did a lot of work on this 

another is he took it seriously did this maybe 

you physics behind relies heavily that he said 

and wanted to see what is the connection really see you 

after all how can this 

you're talking about motives the case 

related to the machine 

the probes physics

 

the images 

some thousands of proton masses 

and the answer is the 

was given already said years ago he seeks eight years you have to wait 

for the eighty asleep rolled into 

what this suggests it is just the rotation in a plane 

so take this dagger 

he said of children abroad opening singles corks 

so then i rotated 

finally have this form 

i've done it a little different 

why because inside 

protons 

this was the remember the picture i got after rotation 

the same diagram 

before these are these two electrons coming out 

okay these are my 

quarter ended 

what happens is a machine at l. a. c.

 

the 

this walks in and like was they live inside my proton 

so when i hit the proton to proton in this large hadron collider this is what this machine is all about i'm sure 

you call this here told you about that 

you would produce 

these energies 

the analogue the double of ozone 

exactly the same way they they did it 

except there's a profound difference there here before there was an old reno and that's just with the energy they don't see 

for them light particles don't exist basically to missing energy and this or like 

here you produce everybody go 

remember because of this spectacular nature 

of its being admire on a state it could use 

a two electrons because 

light 

particles okay i should have stress this name 

for electrons and his buddies 

to seize this is true this exist and this is what is being source 

what you see if you find this guy you will see parity restoration the world will become less isometric 

you will also see left a number way elation what we call the way relation of the electron number did that the production directly

 

and not only indirectly but more than that 

you could actually see this beautiful thing what my run imagine 

before his tragically disappear 

is that they're particles 

course also 

hybrids they cannot decided our body goes i and i particles 

i said it's half time it's a particle halftime is and i'm about to go so many decays 

it's half of the time any case in the leg of a half time into a positron okay 

maybe for my colleagues at the l. h. c. 

to appreciate the extraordinary thing you would actually look deep down into the nature 

but it was never seen before 

and this is the only direct way that you could see this physical process 

so this is the large hadron collider i'm these and more than times 

you've seen this ensure that people here yeah 

trade group here 

ah 

see this was the little thing 

found the w. was on the regional u. k. today's injector 

an amazing about i think maybe a 

no for some reason 

i completely texture 

they're cool since clinton's are his ireland it does

 

there are two major 

detectors outlets 

and c. m. s. 

we have a 

creation or which is strong in c. m. s. and we have an outlet school placing predominantly here right 

they can tell you a lot about what they're doing i want to convince them name 

and they remembered themselves those 

the right time to jump on it 

there is a historic opportunity to see a into the 

or over the 

particle physics on the mall 

now this is how the yeah 

one of the detectives looks like right these are more than times 

a lot of people in this room 

look at the size of the 

now 

i want to tell you ever going to give you the names of people that are dedicated who was at c. m. s. n. at less than that searching for

 

what i mean this guy me here 

this is finally become a reality i am i mean 

i hope i showed some of the enthusiasm and excitement a diet 

for me personally after waiting for such a long time 

and what is graded he had already day daley she's doing much better than we anticipated so there and number oh papers that c. m. s. n. of us have produced 

and now with this beautiful okay we're finally doing real time physics okay those of you that to your

 

bailey a time science may not appreciate what it means to us 

you see remember that i told you that the limit was around this number there was a separate because women that we could come up with 

is finally experiment is catching up 

just few days ago it was last week i think he was on the right a week ago on tuesday 

there was a new paper by a plus 

that has 

disguises so please stay tuned 

holding in your future weekend

 

corey should that's what i told you here 

is there a lacy the large hadron collider can actually probe the original neutrino miles 

directly and not indirectly okay this is the reason i find very excited as a particle serious 

someone who loves a study this elementary particles the only way to seem to their future is this 

big machines 

whatever the 

impact is 

the cost and 

the struggle to build them the only really direct way to see inside of nature is that another low energy processes 

what is grade what i want to tell you that we are talking about the same time scale 

i told you about nuclear physics experiments they're going to the same guy scalia talking 

between three to ten years 

so it's a great time that we can no 

have on befriend ants 

experiments probing 

the same phenomena 

there is at the same time cosmology playing in port the role of neutrino my sudden talk about it here that's a subject in itself

 

and what i want to argue that 

twenty two are 

mister left eye symmetry clues old thank you 

hmmm 

okay 

isn't it so that a 

also your claim 

that this left eye symmetry with neutrinos 

i kissed her and then left 

so uh 

sure 

that's what a 

hmmm 

remember 

you you have a probably another debut you're driving to remember what we said there was 

and 

it is 

union wide 

that's 

left and right images as a broken and finally was 

from the experiments 

what his own up to now was left college 

anyway i should have mentioned this 

they were sure that the world had to be symmetric 

now i a 

i did my work in new york i was in new york and i worked in to have a national aboard a rich was mentioned before 

he really was at columbia university 

which is very close we were in the same city before in the summer he will come to grow hair and he was extremely discouraging

 

all my work by the time 

left one 

they got another prize they didn't wanna talk about their three okay 

that i work at brookhaven seeing and the other guy was a calling in stony brook we were like sister institutions almost like here university and there was also discouraging me all the time 

about ten years ago to really change his mind now he sure 

that world is symmetric 

you have to go to higher energy he wants all of china to look for it so i had to give a summary talking his conference two years ago
-----
 

he was very happy that i reminded the world 

how they had this vision 

this interview was less happy 

then i reminded them that he was discouraging realised i was telling him you know where were you when i'm it is i was doing my career and people are telling me i was wasting my time 

remember we came up with it 

prediction on a three no was true 

left is different for right but if i come to high images 

i won't care 

they will become so similar writer once i look from above 

the figure w. was always a lot if i go to very high energies to me for dawn is not so different from the zeb ozone which is neutral

 

it's very very high energies there be almost no difference 

little difference in in in couple things 

but they will look very similar to us right 

after all what is a small mass there is no small mass 

it means that a massive small compared to an inch 

the major full numbers on a small remember that 

what a small is a dimensionless number so i always mean mass over energy even i speak with 

of g. b. harrier life

 

and that's why we needed big machine 

the you know the questions 

that one 

you mentioned for you it crucial experiment is to see for 

same time 

right 

right 

well it draws or 

so this is a 

the collision of organ and poke work from proton 

you must have a very strong background in this 

the process 

so 

you probably have estimation of the paragraph from 

group group 

that seems that's dominant contribution 

l. h. c. 

oh 

i was going to show you the picture 

the background 

but they don't go to zero when you go to a very high energies 

i've got a precise goes to zero if you go to images about 

about fifteen hundred g. v. 

remember we have to be above twenty five hundred g. v. 

basically they do goes to energy when you look at the same sign which of course since i left ons for people in different fields just two electrons 

the big and effectively goes to zero 

this is the reason why we could see this 

the beggar or you're worried about the things they can come from top walk whatever it is okay

 

the higher the energy 

or via particles ride did the more unlikely to to accidentally producing this thing from the yeah 

thing that you have been to some of the processes that look like this number the sun or the process doesn't exist ride where there could be some missing energy 

i yeah 

i have to show you 

i'm confused what i cannot if i say here i don't see what i see there

 

and i would like a computer expert to help me 

you understand why i cannot see these 

and to see the earth 

there's another question i'm rehabbing i want to show tools here's lama 

a nice i had a nice plus showing this okay which i was afraid it'd be too technical but okay it's 

that 

if i may i would have another question greenish ah had an eight one 

is there anything 

and speaking about the left and right handed between us

 

indecent 

context is there any 

i mean what is the implication for possible lip the genesis 

or you could not maybe differently 

but what is the impact of this to the scene that could be between may matter non time after 

you're saying that these particles are 

particle untie particle blind some sense soul 

is there any relation to the symmetry with 

well 

sure 

yes centre think me a phone 

ah 

that it's a question that requires them 

explanation what you mean

 

ah 

particle physics more than buying a physics came v. they're falling possibility 

i have time to answer 

your question i have to say a few words ride the universe we live in 

let's see how many of you know this i hope you know 

is basically empty right is full of radiation 

cause big microwave background radiation and almost no matter 

it's only to this matter matters a log because what they were little there is 

nominates the 

energy contacts of the universe and interesting thing which is seen the universe 

before i find a should lead to show you to to see a lot of this is the courtesy of a bit sinister my collaborator 

this is the background 

which you call for those of you which are not familiar it is okay 

it's becoming the number went as a functional energy 

you see this is a functional energy this is in this funny units o. g. v. i'm going to very large number here i can bore you into larger number 

these peaks would correspond to seeing that the mass of w. r. 

for college in the field this is right to ignore resonance

 

okay this is the venue was seat you see these particles sort of peaks 

production number we vents all of a sudden they're the number went to a small when you come to them as you get a huge amp 

note is that red is going to zero when you go to i images 

this is why even a small number of events could be

 

could be meaningful 

friends signed by the lady she threw me 

this is likely to for a nice idea particularly keen no the same sign because we wanna see left a number relation richer salute peter's question 

to see was huge 

these energies and then 

slowly goes on 

this is why the studies that are before they were detailed studies performed the something years ago but there are it out this was the outlaws group 

turned out that we can see the these w. r. bozo unsurprisingly even to six thousand g. v. 

if we reach 

this machine 

he's going to double its energy 

very soon 

it's gonna have fourteen thousand g. v. energy 

when these so called mean a city or ability to 

accumulate immense grows 

we will be even to see do gold of a two six thousand okay reach 

what i wanted to argues the scale where we hope 

the respective even for for logical reasons to be low 

now your question 

we live in the world 

image no matter how far you look around yourself 

there's no in diameter 

there are no the center particles 

and too many people it's very surprising why in the world 

sees the particle physics is emitting and the electrons a positron how come

 

when i look around me i don't see descent i met the rhyme 

he starts but knowing that meek eyes notes 

well i know he's met or not and i met her survive this 

and then you go law and then a study the scientists other the galaxy and you go beyond 

and he's a very surprising a particle physics came up to me the 

explanation of that which is loosely scares me a little bit i worked on that and it still scares me
-----
 

it's actually called geneticists and the name tells you that there is sort of a 

war is some detail 

this little probing the energy of the existence of the universe 

it turns out however that you have more those 

based on the left a number why relation days on the violation of electron um 

you see if your theory 

while eight's the symmetry between by legal and i particle 

then it becomes a dynamical question whether i'm more particles and i've i've ago

 

he's that symmetry would not be violated then the initial number 

would be a good game a number 

here's a dynamical question 

the family said that that i can invest show you that my motherly school system be the possibility the genesis the place 

but there's no way of verifying this mechanism version is is that like to talk about it if you're interested 

they've come up after thirty 

or more years 

or what i believe now i'm somebody story this almost metaphysical issue a notice and fifty one that we discussed things 

they cannot be pro but all i think we are moving feared or colleagues in other fields 

and this is completely ignored

 

the best we can hope 

that my more though 

agree see the world in which there is going to matter but i will have no way of proving it 

not a mechanism other dynamics 

so if you want to do in this series you're asking me can produce genesis 

is a decent scale of these images the answer would be no 

we should be that this is not the final cera nature and i will be the last person to tell her that drive ins as as

 

it's finally l. a. c. news 

the air becoming a reality d. 

so called final theory i i don't know if you've been familiar we 

in particle physics or learned rely 

through some dark ages rid 

my colleagues 

speaker a final theory 

final cereal all the phenomena 

it's coming for so called strings of these are going to explain everything 

that you wanted to know not only about five years ago biology and whatnot 

this result will even tell you why biology and why chemistries cairo right why life is carl why the symmetries 

i don't even know what that means okay and and new be nice to discuss 

it's very very very popular these days to use it as it became visibility's one a probe into that it's a very real unfair and wrong claim

 

but he's been perpetuated 

one more question 

so let's write wells pretty 

it's a bunch of 

he exposes 

now what is current phenomena logical 

so 

on this 

kennedy proximity so yeah sure 

well i didn't wanna annoyed becomes a technical issue 

this it is some them although 

has this terribly ugly i'm scared sundays i my nightmares that the standard model may be correct

 

it's a dream of of most of my colleagues but you know one man's dream someone said is another man's nightmare 

mine is that the sun the mother is correct because 

someone else said i'm not sure i think it was barely always that the one of the greatest as it is of science 

is this terrible sect 

that many beautiful series i killed by a defect so nature 

i'm scared it my theory 

our theory was working on may be killed by a defect so nature and the standard model you know there is it 

you know theory reach every people 

completely world 

imagine they could be true the beauty of the sun the more that i want to emphasise

 

it's an extraordinary simple 

theory which has this one higgs particle with the properties well understood well under control 

that's the beauty 

and this may finally the entity simplicity 

in spite of this 

ingenuity may be true 

this thing ford also people who search for new phenomena is this theory has offers a lot of interesting cases 

for example the doubly charged particle whose signatures a spectacular 

and they're dedicated group said the lacy independently even of the serie a developing okay we've been in court are we are now in the 

strict the a mi chi another's me to see a man school which are providing them details of what is happening is doubly charge guys who really spectacular 

because it would became the pair electrons by itself 

so this is all understudy 

but that would of course make it 

maybe too technical or just hoping for the people in other fields 

together basic picture 

the media not having questions from 

our colleagues or not 

could have been that clear 

or that confuse it 

huh 

very simple and short question

 

just when you when you discussed 

compare d. they reach again eighty compared to what you call to rest to call a 

it's on to 

we are 

if i'm so quickly those actually is 

and 

and it's an experimental bone is just indirect 

experimental constraints and uh but it's not 

right 

yeah 

when you really try million and two point five easy 

the two point five t. v. 

when you direct 

the the eighties closing 

on to the theoretical a 

bounds

 

later that put it 

i would think this is due 

the experimental but just 

indirectly 

right from flavour and 

this thing to write what you call to radical limit 

and 

be a 

this is now this is not my talk 

this is a more particle physics version of my talk with details within ares alluding tool 

is the limits of twenty precise number twenty five hundred g. that i said the ladies coming to ted

 

doing this this would be to limit they're looking at the technical it would be digests not depending on the nature of leno's not depending on the anything okay 

and the number that is 

for if if ryan odinga's rely you'll be missing energy the number was 

already produce with the lumen a city all five the universe 

phantom arm 

it would be so the actually we are today 

in a situation where they're about to publish this 

she 

fisher i'm more 

are concerned about this statement this is a theoretical limit 

i think her mental image is just in there 

act experimental 

oh 

right right now this is very good reason didn't want to talk about it here because experiment caught up 

this is a very good point 

this interrogated by delays it to limit in the minimal theory all i said here 

was done in the minimal see right if i want to tell you what the predictions i have to be in the minimum other 

the beautiful thing about experiment it is going beyond the minimal see right into becoming and this i didn't even want to talk about it here 

even when i give now technical talks i stop talking about it we did a lot of work here 

you can say why in the world right maybe she had me more wise and more patient pathetic of this is our you know it's hard to be 

subtly wise right so far 

it's good to know 

you see the and telling people that we need fourteen p. 

it's so nice also to tell people you not gonna seat now 

this was a lower limit you're going to come at best to the same okay in order to see the other process you 

very very likely we were telling before need fourteen period it's good to know that you didn't make full promises 

so in that sense maybe the analysis 

was used 

and there are no more christmas let's 

this was another
