Description
Neutrinos, the most aloof of all elementary particles, have played a major role in shaping 
our understanding of physical forces in nature. Postulated originally in order to maintain 
energy conservation in nuclear decays, they needed more than twenty five years in order to 
be discovered. As suggested by the young Italian genius Ettore Majorana who disappeared 
mysteriously some more than seventy years ago, neutrinos may be unique particles in being 
their own antiparticles. This leads to a spectacular phenomenon: the creation of electrons 
'out of nothing'. I show how the Large Hadron Collider can play a key role in this exciting 
process through the of restoration of Left-Right symmetry in elementary particle interactions.
