Slide 33
Dear Radioactive Ladies and Gentlemen,As the bearer of these lines, to whom I graciously ask you to listen, will explain to you in more detail, how because of the "wrong" statistics of the N and Li6!nuclei and the continuous beta spectrum, I have hit upon a desperate remedy to save the "exchange theorem" of statistics and the law of conservation of energy. Namely, the possibility that there could exist in the nuclei electrically neutral particles, that I wish to call neutrons, which have spin 1/2 and obey the exclusion principle and which further differ from light quanta in that they do not travel with the velocity of light. The mass of the neutrons should be of the same order of magnitude as the electron mass and in any event not larger than 0.01 proton masses. The continuous beta spectrum would then become understandable by the assumption that in beta decay a neutron is emitted in addition to the electron such that the sum of the energies of the neutron and the electron is constant...I agree that my remedy could seem incredible because one should have seen those neutrons very earlier if they really exist. But only the one who dare can win and the difcult situation, due to the continuous structure of the beta spectrum, is lighted by a remark of my honoured predecessor, Mr Debye, who told me recently in Bruxelles: "Oh, It's well better not to think to this at all, like new taxes". From now on, every solution to the issue must be discussed. Thus, dear radioactive people, look and judge. Unfortunately, I cannot appear in Tubingen personally since I am indispensable here in Zurich because of a ball on the night of 6/7 December. With my best regards to you, and also to Mr Back.Your humble servant. W. Pauli!Wednesday 4 April 12

 Savannah River reactor large ux of neutrinos !=1013cm!2s!14lectron, namely, 0.51 million electronolt (MeV). The two gamma rayswould accelerate electrons throughCompton scattering and initiate a cas-ade of electrons that would eventuallyause the liquid to scintillate. The tinyash of visible light, efciently onverted into an electronic pulse,would be the signal of the positron.The new idea was to detect not onlyhe positron but also the neutron (seeFigure 3). Once produced, the neutronounces around and slows down as itollides with protons. It can be capturedy a proton to produce deuterium, oreavy hydrogen. But if a nucleus suchs cadmium is present, the neutron has amuch greater chance of being captured.Adding a cadmium salt to the organiccintillator dramatically increases theross section for absorbing (low-energy)eutrons. The capture process releasesbout 9 MeV of energy in gamma rays. The average time between the ash f light from the positron-electron nnihilation and that from the neutron apture is a few microseconds. Electronic circuits could be designed toetect this delayed-coincidence signa-ure, two ashes of light (each within awell-dened energy range) separated by microseconds, and provide a powerfulmeans to discriminate the signature of nverse beta decay from backgroundoise. Thus, using the much smaller uxf reactor neutrinos became feasible. As Cowan (1964) remembers,Instead of detecting a burst of eutrinos in a second or two comingrom the fury of a nuclear explosion, we would now be able to watch atiently near a reactor and catch onevery few hours or so. And there aremany hours available for watching in  monthor a year. The First Large DetectorThe group spent that winter uilding the detectors, developing arious liquid-scintillator compositions,nd testing the response of the etectors to gamma rays. Each detector was about 28 inches in diameter and30 inches high (see photo on thispage), and 90 photomultiplier tubespenetrated its curved walls. The phototubes were connected intwo interleaved arrays, each of whichwould produce an electrical pulse in response to a light signal in the detector.The two pulses would then be sent to aprompt-coincidence circuit, whichwould accept them as a bona de signalonly if they arrived simultaneously.That prompt-coincidence requirementhelped eliminate counting the spurious dark current that arose spontaneously and at random in the phototubes themselves. The team worked in an isolated, unheated building. Cowan (1964) reports how some of our group sweptthe snow away from outside the build-ing and set about casting many largeblocks of parafn wax and borax foruse as neutron shielding when wewould go to a reactor. Others beganmixing gallons of liquid scintillator inbatches with varying composition.They had to use electrical heaters tokeep the toluene scintillator warm; otherwise, it would turn from transpar-ent to cloudy. Soon, they discoveredthat one of the brands of mineral oilcarried by a local druggist, whenmixed with suitable chemicals, couldserve as another liquid scintillator.Having a hydrogen density differentfrom that of toluene, the mineral oilwould yield a different measured ratefor inverse beta decay and thus providea consistency check on the experi-mentof course, if the experimentalerror could be made small enough tomake the difference visible.The threesome who carried the primary responsibility for developingand testing the detector were F. NewtonHayes, Robert Schuch, and Ernest C.Anderson from Wright Langhams biomedical/health physics researchgroup. Using various radioactivegamma-ray sources, they discovered thattheir large-volume liquid scintillation detectors were extremely efcient at detecting gamma rays, enough to revolutionize the counting of smallamounts of radioactivity in bulk samples. The group realized they couldtest the radioactive content of the materials used to construct the detectorand eliminate those that would add unduly to the background.As Cowan (1964) reports, We builta cylindrical well into one of the detectors and proceeded to put quantitiesof steel, liquids, wax, and other materialsinto it for testing. We found that brassand aluminum were quite radioactivecompared to iron and steel, and that thepotassium in the glass envelopes of ourphotomultiplier tubes would contribute tothe detector backgrounds.During this time, one of our group,Robert Schuch, proposed making the wellin the detector a bit larger so that wemight be able to put a human being intothe detector. This was done, and a number of people, including our secretary, were trussed up and loweredinto the 18-inch hole. We found quite a detectable counting rate from everyone.It was due to the radioactive potassium-40naturally present in the body.The Hanford Neutrino DetectorThe background photo is a top view ofthe neutrino detector used in the Hanfordexperiments. It shows the interior of the10-cubic-foot vat for the liquid scintillatorand the 90 photomultiplier tubes, eachwith a 2-inch-diameter face that had athin, photosensitive surface. The inset is a side view of the detector. Having a 300-liter capacity, Herr Auge (Germanfor Mr. Eye, as this detector was named)was the largest detector at the time.In 1956, Ernest C. Anderson, Robert Schuch, James Perrings, and WrightLangham developed the whole-body counter known as HUMCO I. Its design was a direct spinoff from the development of the rst large liquid-scintillation detector used in Reines and Cowans neutrino experiments atHanford. HUMCO I measured low levels of naturally occurring radioactivity in humans. Later, it was used in a worldwide effort to determine the degreeto which radioactive fallout from nuclear tests and other nuclear and natural sources was absorbed by the human body. The detector consisted of a cylindrical container lled with 140 gallons of liquid scintillator and surrounded by 108 photomultiplier tubes. The person being measured wasplaced in a slide and drawn into the detector. Gamma rays emitted by the naturally occurring radioisotope potassium-40 or the fallout isotope cesium-137, for example, would largely penetrate the detectors inner wall,excite the scintillator, and be detected. HUMCO II, which supersededHUMCO I in 1962, was nearly 10 times more sensitive, and its measure-ments were that much safer and quicker. The top photo shows Anderson sitting at the controls of HUMCO II. To his right is the slide that would carry Schuch inside the detector for radioactive measurement. In 1958, the human counter was demonstrated at the Atoms for Peace Conference held in Geneva. Built especially for this conference, the verticalcounter was open on one side to allow a person to step in for measurementof internal radioactivity. The middle picture shows a conference participantgetting ready to enter the detector under Newton Hayes supervision. The lower picture and diagram show the rst human-radioactivity measure-ments carried out in the detector that served as the basis for HUMCO. The original purpose of that detector had been different: to determine thedegree to which the natural gamma-ray activity of the materials used toshield the Hanford neutrino detector would add noise to the experiments.Schuch suggested that a larger insert into the detector would allow a smallperson to be placed inside and then be measured for gamma-ray activity.Langham, shown crouched inside the detector, was the only member of the team slim enough to t in the narrow space.The Whole-Body CounterThe Reines-Cowan ExperimentsThe Reines-Cowan ExperimentsLos Alamos Science Number 25  1997Number 25  1997  Los Alamos Science  good old days8 peopledetector : water (protons)Cowan and Reines 56  p+!!n+e(ten thousand billions)Wednesday 4 April 12
