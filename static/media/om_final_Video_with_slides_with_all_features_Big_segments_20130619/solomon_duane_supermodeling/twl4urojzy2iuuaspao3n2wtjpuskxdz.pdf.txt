SUMMARY  Problem: IPCC-class climate models give widely divergent                    predictions in regard to:                        a) magnitude of long-term climate change                        b) detailed regional predictions                        c) short-term climate change                   Can we do better than averaging model outputs?   Potential Solution: Take the synchronization view of data assimilation,                                   and allow models to form a consensus (synchronize)                                   by assimilating data from one another.               -                - Parameters can be nudged as well as states without ensembles.               - Choose the adaptable parameters to be connection coefficients                  linking corresponding variables in different models; adapt                  them using historical data.

Ocean supermodel can be trained on longer time scales.

What if all models err in the same way? Analogous to group of experts who make the same mistake,      but to different degrees        and extrapolate to values outside the range of the group  A very risky procedure! 
---------
Slide 15
What if all models are biased in same direction? Lorenz supermodel with truth < 1, 2, 3      Some connections become negative zsupermodel - ztruth Not as effective as positive connections, but better than averaging. weather-prediction mode

Slide 16
What if parameters shift between training  and testing? Train with Lorenz  =28 and then reset  adaptation =28 =50 =100 Average of outputs        (unfused) Fusion Attractors -fusion still better than averaging even when training and test systems  differ by a large number of dynamical bifurcations
