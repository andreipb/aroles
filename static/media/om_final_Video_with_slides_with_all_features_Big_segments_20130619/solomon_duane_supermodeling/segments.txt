as an approach show that a computational model in generally that 

oh 

no i think yeah can be 

or to artificial consciousness 

and also tell you in a few minutes 

why i think that's the case 

um 

i 

i tried to list all we contributors phone call to somebody else 

i 

um 

so to start 

this 

so the new approach to data assimilation 

data assimilation news ah 

ah 

a test that that should happen all over the place but really happens or in meteorology 

ah 

then another places 

sick 

so 

situation where we have a computational model 

i 

um 

that to a process of that creates new information as a model 

was running 

of so 

even instant of time 

ah 

the 

of the weather prediction model 

of has its idea of what's going on objective way goes to saying current forecast 

we have new observation 

scenes from the instruments 

on the test is 

to model 

although i mean to marry 

re 

ah via the observations 

and the curve 

state of the model because my there is typically completely rage

 

oh 

and the main point is that the 

the model he's not a slave to observations of the models 

as a semi autonomous system 

sort of nudged 

but the observations 

therefore you 

oh 

um 

a new 

the apparent 

i moved of synchronization of chaotic systems 

a chaotic system being 

oh 

general 

financial system of you 

which represent 

as 

or is both reality 

and model 

oh 

a currency position 

to such things 

his role of and so on 

so her arm 

wilson have a pointer 

you have some physical orders 

or 

their substitutes 

all 

cancels trouble these things 

so 

armed 

hmmm okay so say 

this is you 

a real world 

of which is chaotic so we represent that 

those are three very boring system

 

on this is your model 

ah 

it's been known since nineteen ninety that's a 

if we couple to such things loosely that is truly one of many variables 

despite sensitive dependence on initial conditions we can get them to synchronize 

um 

this works of a so this one i'm showing you years actually if i variable system 

this a slave to that 

um 

if a we simply substitute the x. variable one for the x. verbal the other 

on and as i said despite sensitive initial can essential conditions 

the difference goes to zero 

of sending works a couple white doesn't always work does work a couple z. 

so on 

if you're simply observing x.

 

uh than simply observing x. is enough 

to slave 

the whole model around system 

to reality 

to predict whether 

yes 

and so 

about become a simulation so this means 

as you observe the makeup 

you are you substitute you know the state 

part of the state variables 

in your already model 

we the actual observed value 

but other than that the simulation 

it's 

um yeah and uh you just reminded me that this also works if we don't do complete replacement

 

if we simply have a nudging term or relaxation term over here 

that's the point that i want to make it 

it 

with only a low you have to actually 

a mate of features like four 

once one step ahead all we've been horizon 

a because 

you can't make about trance independently 

unless you observe 

the real world as you go 

did the the nudging aren't 

um somebody 

observations 

okay but you can think of this 

does a continuous model 

discrete system 

so that you have to do this every so often every six hours 

and approximately every six hours a continuous process 

this takes a bit of work 

but 

okay so the six hours and 

you make two pictures developed inferring 

observations and i'm 

after six hours and then 

well the more than the predictions for the next six 

yeah 

or 

okay so on 

we stood back 

okay so are my point is that a 

what this as as as perception of this as

 

um 

model 

of perceiving 

but not be enslaved 

to reality 

the idea of super modelling 

is to work 

a bunch of models of perceive each other 

as well as reality 

so here we have a 

i know 

three models 

couple to each other 

of the different arrows between any given pair of models correspond to 

a different variables 

a x. y. and z. 

a node which we use to nudge each other with different coefficients 

represented here 

um 

and um 

then we are um 

that's a and 

yeah of the coefficient and since on training regimen 

so that 

this combination of models 

synchronised with each other as well as with reality 

um 

ah

 

is a better model 

and the not anyone considered individually or better than than simply the average of the models which is what 

is typically gun and a 

a state of the art in climate 

on projection hell you run different climate models 

and ah if you want to combine them and you text 

parma 

of weighted average after the fact 

his name is late 

each of them although some bonds how his position 

and his position using your i don't know 

ten years 

you get because anymore 

the major your 

and then you average 

evictions 

yeah i i was 

blurring the difference between weather prediction and climate 

election will obviously climate prediction 

you turn the connections reality off 

and when you're on the models for ten years 

when something is about to say in that case and the case you're only interested 

in the overall shape of a tractor 

of either the individual model or the supermodel are not interested 

and of the instantaneous state as your 

weather prediction you don't care 

what's going to be happening on january first in twenty fifty

 

wanna know 

ah 

the overall shape of the tractor 

the 

and the point 

you average them out of the transport spark off with a prediction some eight 

you don't make a new prediction 

by funding during the three models in combination 

that's the current state of the art yes 

ah okay 

and ah 

what's wrong with that current state of the art is that's a 

um 

these models 

a differ why 

a layer of enough of them 

magnitude of a look 

climate change 

oh 

oh but to affected by about a factor too

 

among them 

oh 

a in the projected 

a temperature increase globally 

averaged over the next hundred years 

um 

oh 

i 

they're pretty much useless for of them for regional want term original projections 

though because of the differences between them 

and likewise for short term predictions 

um 

so the question is can we do better 

and averaging 

on 

and so super modelling idea 

it is 

ah 

take the synchronization view of data similar 

mission 

and what the models synchronize with each other 

as well as a 

as reality 

um 

and ah 

f. 

all the question is how do we do we connect them 

models 

all turns out 

that's the oven 

a room in tears synchronization and it's easy 

it's of systems can be synchronised 

it's 

ecosystems can be synchronised of 

then if you very of a few parameters and one of its generally easy to extend the dynamical equations 

a to synchronize parameters as low states 

and so the learning isn't hard 

and 

no aging 

nudging means 

but see we 

the worst case we have cohen right 

and 

so 

directional or 

articles as you can 

um 

i merging would mean 

so um 

oh 

these small portions 

action 

oh 

i mean 

he 

a year 

yeah 

thanks 

plus um 

so we put back next one equation but then we just add 

some constant 

time and so 

so nudge 

x. one to x. 

it's 

yeah mixing x. k. out of all of you 

you just a small room 

correct

 

okay 

are don't worry about the details of the slide 

the horizontal axis is error on a logical logarithmic scale 

other p. stands for projects 

ah 

climate models comparison project these are three different 

a projects over the course of time 

a to compare 

ah 

uh 

different climate models 

ah 

and ah we see that the klan models are getting better 

ah 

the point is the on the black circles 

are just averages 

we always do better 

by averaging climate models 

r. e. a. is re analysis of 

it's a best estimate of truth 

and this is 

pre industrial controller on 

ah but with the same climate models but with different so 

levels of forcing 

oh 

so what movies excuse me 

oh 

we oh 

yeah 

far far right now 

the left is better right 

this is error 

so there 

yeah so they're getting better over time we still 

widespread 

oh 

any breach of it 

the thoughts 

by 

great 

yeah a 

okay 

and the arm 

okay 

um 

so on 

this is a little less to mark on mount comparison project in the point here 

is the magnitude of of the numbers that you see
-----
 

ah 

this is the year an annual 

mean surface air temperatures 

and see numbers like twenty four 

um 

so 

armed 

this is the immune state um 

i mean the mean model 

um 

and the ah 

point is these numbers are pretty big 

and this is for precipitation 

um 

the white areas are are where less than two thirds of the models even agree on the sign 

or precipitation change 

um 

so again 

big divergence among models 

cork and again all of this is not just requirement modelling it's for any situation where we have 

a computational model of an objective process 

where the objective process continues to provide a dozen models running 

r. i. 

so to test the overall idea 

um 

first it with a 

ah just with simple around systems 

again this is your answer your system which are calling truth

 

um 

and then you have three models of truth and x. by i 

each of which has three variables x. y. and z. 

ah 

and on 

so um 

and each of these three models you have the same dynamics that you have in truth 

but with different parameters that's what's different 

i actually threw an an extra parameter to represent 

the fact that 

a in some models may have 

actually different equations 

so i just have this constant term see we deal with that 

arm 

and then we have 

all of these big k.'s nudge the models to truth 

cesar the connections 

nudging the models to each other 

um 

the more general form which will not use and connects the models 

so but for us both 

they got us nation and model synchronization 

great 

o. k. so first we go through a training phase 

we're on 

as i said on 

you can general when you have synchronization

 

all you can generally at the dynamical law 

to um 

that the parameters synchronize parameters low states in this a search 

and added equation 

for the parameters except the parameters in this case there these connection coefficients 

not the internal parameters of the system 

ah so this may not be the best way to do learning but strictly simple way 

i um 

and um 

what um 

okay what this says 

is that imagine integrating this of this equation over time

 

and what you're doing 

is taking a correlation 

between now on the of the difference the synchronization error between any two models 

and ah 

via of the overall supermodel error weren't taking the supermodel output to be the ah 

simply the average 

of the few of corresponding variables in the three models 

carl ocean 

between that error and the difference between the two models 

you want to increase or to decrease the coefficients 

a depending on the magnitude and sign of the coalition's 

sense 

two pieces 

this time very 

it's 

oh 

in the training case uefa coefficients be time varying on you freeze them 

humphries on here 

i 

so um 

okay on 

and i are in so the area 

rapidly goes to a small value not zero turns out so you know at first i thought this was some sort of local optimum 

ah but the reason that doesn't go all the way to zero is simply that we're not 

ah 

ah 

we're not doing complete replacement 

so um 

anyway um 

now compare that system to the every air that we get from simply averaging 

the models 

get a lot lesser from supermodel 

from the average 

what if we did some kind of a weighted average instead 

well to a i set this up 

i suspect the parameters up so that each of the three models 

uh oh there was exactly one equation one of the three equations

 

that was completely right role of parameters right 

ah okay so um 

you 

ah 

so a few years so 

whatever models has actually of not only this equation but are perfectly equation 

ah 

but that doesn't help you at all 

census suggests that even a weighted average 

is much worse than the supermodel 

supermodel results 

um 

so i 

what we have is a three way synchronization of 

well if we had two models 

it would be three way if it's more models it's more ways 

um 

of truth and alternative models are using some of the collective synchronization affect 

ah 

and a 

the learning law 

can be so we see mister generalization of had had been wearing and have been wearing

 

ah 

if you rely and i think that if you have synchronization 

between 

iran's another side of the science 

of science gets 

but in the connection become stronger 

ah 

here a 

service supervise version of the same thing 

where 

a synapse become stronger a 

if as a result of 

two neurons collectively 

do their thing 

in concert with reality 

um 

as i said we're really interested in the overall tractor is not an 

the um 

on 

but 

and 

since any estates 

so without telling you how we change the learning all this is going from my simple wearing want to a more standard approach to to machine learning 

although the tractors that we get with the simple learning law 

ah don't look bad either 

ah i 

have you the result this is just 

the tractor for one of the individual models 

tractor for another of the individual models 

degree in the background as truth 

third model 

on 

despite all that i need is that despite the big differences a and from reality the supermodel actually help seal 

on 

the point that's that's worth making is that 

um 

suppose we're a um 

we're just interested in the statistical properties the a tractor

 

something like globally averaged temperature 

um 

well suppose to 

uh suppose this is x. 

of the global average temperature in the individual models 

still way off 

ah 

but we get 

and tractor 

with the corrects globally averaged 

temperature a log x. 

forces that kirk we 

ah 

okay and just to show you what the learning algorithm those 

other produce those results of

 

ah this was due to work by a 

i 

when event and bridge and frank sultan invigorate myself 

ah 

here we introduce 

a cost function and for the supermodel offices supermodel 

armed 

just a function of the connection coefficients over time 

um i 

and ah 

we introduced kind of of 

a damping factor 

in of this cost function 

so that we're continuously re initial izing 

on 

but as time goes on we count pierre a less and less 

the cost function as a scam 

over two term 

drug entity character and draw 

shops 

ah 

and minimising that's true 

essentially gradient descent approach 

knoxville describe was talk 

um 

we got detractors of egyptian you 

okay so 

oh 

the rest of what i'm going to say corresponds to a whole bunch of questions that you might 

s. about this approach 

of the first one is a 

what if we go from mama from simple things like iran system

 

two of models where there's a wide range of time scales 

are all this is such a model 

ah 

x. y. and z. 

ah 

it's actually another model 

jeweller ends 

ah 

standard lawrence model of the comes from a 

taking equations for convection 

ah and of just taking a few fourier components 

of of 

the special fields 

of the sky response doing the same thing out with convection 

but with another model for for atmospheric circulation 

on 

then we coupled was to this other two variable model which is a very simple model of a 

well the box model of the ocean 

on 

and where on 

t. n. s. actually i read temperature gradients from equator quite a polio one boxer present equator another box representing paul 

i am the polar regions 

on and these constants that appear in these two equations 

a are very small 

so overall of 

the ocean evolves on a much slower timescale 

and the atmosphere 

i r. i. 

so but what i did 

so it took three of a is a 

but er parameters in both the atmospheric in the oceanic components 

ah

 

and i got the same phenomenon that's a 

the ah 

a supermodel 

goes to truth 

of over 

not too long period of time 

via a 

the ocean part of a supermodel goes to ocean truth this is 

temperature gradient in the ocean 

r. i. 

turns out that what's really happening here 

is that a 

you from a supermodel you're adding nudging terms to these equations 

so that 

ah 

and then the nudging terms because these coefficients are smaller much bigger 

then the ah 

the dynamical terms 

are you basically forcing 

on your ocean model to truth very quickly 

and then using 

ocean observations 

ah 

to train the atmosphere mall 

that's not a bad strategy 

ah 

first rain grief s. timescales
-----
 

using some sort of 

the climatological average for the slow timescales 

then worry about training the ocean 

more fundamental question 

is 

on new what happens 

is a 

if wall models on air in the same direction 

ah 

is for a we have a bunch of experts 

a old home 

a predicts a temperature that is too high 

of 

well um 

i um 

you one thing you can do is a 

is use the ah 

use the prediction that's consistent legally strong 

the training phase 

and extrapolate outside of the range 

ah 

that's 

obviously a highly risky an unstable procedure but you can try it 

with lawrence models 

a what happens if you take a parameter a signal was a grammar nor insisted 

and what happens if you take a all the uh the signal is 

in the 

individual models that comprise the supermodel to be greater 

then a 

a true sigma 

well if you allow the corona connections to become negative 

ah 

you still get a workable supermodel 

ah 

if you remember the palazzo showed you before 

a doses roughly the same scale 

of 

blown up a 

it's better than other nothing 

and better than averaging 

um 

but not as good 

as an ordinary supermodel with a

 

with positive connections 

ah 

this is still in weather prediction mode where the where you're cut a couple gets reality okay so you're using your supermodel to predict whether again a motor you constantly have input every six hours 

analogous lee 

ah but ah 

it turns out that a 

i 

do we think we can do 

this to work under some connections and 

under some conditions and climate prediction node 

we just disconnect reality what it run freely

 

uh oh but so far only seen a blow up 

ah 

hmmm 

a little girl 

thirdly chance of a in the direction they you ever 

the 

yeah teaching section 

i 

not if you are negative coefficients is the weights 

okay 

but this means that 

you don't just have 

burying button that foxo so 

it 

three 

so i mean 

there's a whole area of learning ensemble sweeping the machine learning com

 

and there 

so 

outgrowth of his most often taken to average all what are people or 

something along these lines 

it's all because of the cost of parts 

the 

think is through 

i'm not a broad goal setting 

where you actually loan 

wrong but because of the basic models anybody a knee 

you you have an extra learning layer very avant just 

a puppet shows but you really allow me to leave 

of 

artistically done for example who political 

we give you a bonus 

the predictions of one of the models 

if one of them almost isn't because the opposite of that 

you say of this is that you use your just 

okay 

that's exactly six everything i was looking for 

okay 

i wanna see how it's done that went 

talk about a 

sweater 

and 

in your interview some of the learning problem

 

where are you prediction for the mortals 

every year you'd be 

and 

you were and but 

connections 

in these that workers 

from there 

separate learning problem 

oh 

oh how to combine the provisions 

okay it's not just the averaging but it's 

you 

you do learn of 

the general function approximation 

four 

you 

okay 

on 

and the other big question is a 

what are we doing here on 

we're we're running a bunch of climate models were training room non present a data so over the phone should be able to use this and weather prediction mode

 

but then what we're doing is we're we're asking what happens if we change the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 

or other greenhouse gases 

first ones to changing one parameter 

so i on your training with a bunch of of models 

and ah then your oven 

you somehow shifting them a 

idols 

ah ah oh some 

parameter in the models that you think represents a real parameter 

ah 

a picture road because if you go back to 

supermodels a 

yeah row was the same another to grow wasn't one of those parameters that varies among different models rose was 

which grammar zeros 

c. o. two level 

or some function thereof 

um 

so on 

okay so what happens if you train with the with royals twenty eight which is a standard value fuller and system

 

but then you shift 

growing both reality in models lawyer goes up a little 

shift a lot 

on 

it's a goes up 

one more 

turns out the sky response that you can you can study bifurcation somewhere in systems has been done 

uh oh this is a large number from from here to here is a large number of bifurcation is 

i think it's on the order of maybe a hundred something like that but 

um 

so if i look at the tractors this almost looks like a quasi periodic thing it's not like 

stranger tractor anymore this is the zero equals a hundred 

yet the earth still 

pretty small 

um 

and ah and certainly better than an averaging 

um 

okay um 

both a simple learning more that i showed you and beyond 

of the work 

the one based on the more complicated cost function 

a separate from 

possible problem of 

non global non global local optimum 

on 

so far the only thing we've done with to get out of to to deal with this as um 

that noise 

in one form or another 

on 

this is a fairly complicated to of 

learning method of 

but i'm not going to describe but the point is that 

one measure 

ah of bomb 

a of the models difference between auto correlation functions 

of of the truth and supermodel 

and they are 

ah this is for the three variables 

are the dotted line 

is for of a deterministic learning schemes solid line 

is for a stochastic learning scheme 

um 

in all cases 

andreas truth in all cases took us to city helps 

not surprisingly 

this this is the year is in the middle of love with the provisions yeah

 

people for example 

so costly purchases 

it's 

no 

ah 

okay so far distant talk me bowler and systems 

of 

i need you to extend this to p. d.'s have a 

you used before we go to anything as complicated as a climate model 

i 

this is just tremendous efficiency 

um 

simple one time one space dimensional p. it's been used to

 

i represent propagation 

and that way propagation in um 

a dissipated media 

and ah 

so on 

and if we couple these models not only discreetly in time but ah 

actually i guess for not doing discreetly in time but it's clearly in space 

armed 

it's only a fixed set of points on which is what we want to do i mean i do it with weather prediction no also again 

we don't just make 

ah 

observations about 

for some time every six hours but they're sparse and space 

on one question for p. t. is then 

is a 

can we say anything about so on 

that have close the observations need to be in order to get synchronization 

ah 

well 

ah 

i this is a two axes are space and time 

and you see 

propagating coherent structures 

ah 

so actually this is not an ordinary k. s. s. k. s. with this extra third derivative added which gives you wave propagation

 

ah 

and um 

so what do we do if we are 

oh why use terraces log of error 

versus of nudging coefficient 

on 

models are on kabul the air of slowly goes down 

armed 

if we a fixed the connections 

between the models so this is an annual reset supermodel not a train supermodel 

ah 

we do somewhat better 

but if we adapt the connections 

according to the simple learning what we do better yet 

hmmm 

where where these confusions 

visions of his life 

i 

they're not there because this is just one model offices
-----

 

and this is just one 

so long you ever wondered many more coefficients for the feeds 

i 

well that's one question 

how many independent is symmetry of this thing is simple 

so we keep the connections and had just translation symmetry is no reason to think the connections 

should be different different points 

so we 

have like of now 

three or six independent connections 

it 

so for them 

actually it's the new learning the good which is 

yeah in one of those 

seems to have visions of old over time 

in india and you fills them 

here in principle that officials were neatly evil all the time 

and in space 

and then have 

on 

i know 

he wouldn't 

coefficients are just functions of time have functions of space 

similar the same 

you'll points in space 

they stay that way 

what 

very 

okay 

okay 

and um 

so what variables 

so another question is what variable should we couple of performing a climate predictions supermodel 

of everyone a couple everything 

um 

even independently of 

um 

if we assume we're working in space and we have translation symmetry

 

which we don't 

because topography changes 

but ah 

ah we still have lots of variables at each point 

and we don't need to work 

in physical space 

um 

so on 

here what we did was to a 

ah 

okay first of onset of working in physical space you can work in fourier space or 

on a sphere which is models and modelling sphere 

of spherical harmonic sir are the basis functions 

and you can compare coupling between the basis of spherical harmonic stood basis of 

perk orthogonal functions otherwise known as principal components 

um the nudging timescale 

is that basically one over the sea or if it was called k. before 

so as you go this way a timescale was increasing which means the nudging 

it strengthens decreasing which means the earth is going up 

ah 

the gray his first record harmonic so the white grey 

actually it's white here 

is for using principal components and not surprisingly we do somewhat better

 

this trouble components 

uh in each of these panels here 

the horizontal axis represents a number of components that are coupled 

and we need your once you get the area down to effectively zero 

if we are 

intelligence of choosing um 

a basis 

um okay 

i put these in here wasn't sure those in the meantime or introduce a 

this isn't more comp 

okay to pete 

so the classic history 

shall model used to represent weather 

a lonely just tell you quickly what this as a

 

this is a a two layer model these are not two layers these are two models 

of 

at each model 

satisfies this equation 

which says that potential works a city realty with a dozen at this quantity q. is 

is almost and serves as an objective derivative 

concert except for forcing anticipation 

ah 

this is a this is an approximation that gets this piano her stokes 

ah but 

it gives us some are pretty real was 

sick representation 

of of some weather phenomena

 

a potential works a city he's a 

to the curl border city would be like to curl a velocity 

potential work to city 

is a 

a modification of that to include effects from the earth's rotation 

and from affected forest ease of 

a stretcher compressed in each of the two layers and we still want conservation of angular momentum overall 

that allows us to find a quantity 

q. which i'm not going to find here 

but ah 

but which 

those out of this is a different kind of coupling 

ah 

and 

j. is a chico b. n. d. x. the first term 

a minus d. x. the first turn to do i have a second term minus ty the first term d. t. x. of the first term of that 

second term 

the derivatives of the stream function sign a give us velocities so maybe can take my word for it that this j. normally gives you the affective component

 

we put the coupling into the affective component 

oh 

and ah what i describe this later if anybody really wants to know but the point is that even with this more complicated form of coupling we can derive 

learning offer this of 

these simple models 

and ah 

here's truth this is a model with a jet stream over the atlantic still model jet stream or the pacific 

um 

it's a little different at the beginning as time goes on this synchronized 

both of which other country 

and 

back to the previous night 

you don't couple here over da 

system variables 

looking out over these 

effective terms 

the 

on that 

you don't a 

instead you have something 

more complicated than the thirteen year

 

as the difference yeah the system that yeah there is something more complicated yet yeah 

but you can still do it and the reason you do that 

is because if you do it this way 

then it turns out that so on 

the ah 

the average of the solutions to the to to model equation separately 

is exactly 

of the solution to the model with the average for saying in other words for the jet stream over both 

atlantic and pacific which is what you really want 

oh 

this was extra knowledge of what you do 

third yeah 

yeah it's not 

there is in the first invention 

somebody did a likely it loses thirty per person 

doesn't know much about one thing 

st. leading to understand that the people in these variables 

he's a reasonable time 

firstly they get to use 

i have no knowledge of the climate modelling 

so these flamini is beyond 

but ah 

young my age 

okay 

well 

pardon 

and i think that's an over statement 

the under each 

but i don't think they explain mix 

oh 

okay 

yes 

um 

you one c. to be a half 

and the simple case because 

you want equal contributions from two models 

and what the simple warning law 

c. does it have 

okay um 

i just stuck those few slides in because those most complicated case that would do with so for 

and supermodel

 

um 

but um 

okay so where are we were going 

ah 

so on 

so for if we have local up to know rely just on circus to see 

uh and 

but that what we'd like to do is a as defined triggers of based on state 

of of 

the world 

who's 

and 

your models 

armed 

that would tell us when we might need 

effectively muted mutation 

um 

these negative coefficients a 

we need to do 

just as you said 

ah some super learning approach 

ah 

that's a 

ah 

i'm sorry not negative coefficients 

but to tell us 

when we need to extrapolate away 

from the individual models 

of 

in um 

ah 

and serve a metal 

and another points is a 

that was raised in this 

on how do we use their knowledge of the system 

to restrict the number of of the connections that we trained separately 

uh we have translation of symmetry it's simple 

um 

but um 

how do we use 

other kinds of symmetry 

ah 

or some sort of personal knowledge or guesses 

of 

so that we don't 

need to risk over training 

lou limited data 

ah 

with all of this what we're doing with a situation where a 

the amount of data is limited we only for climate protection we only have the data for the last fifty or sixty 

years of 

but we have 

oh 

as much computer times we want to do boring 

ah i 

so we need some more domain specificity

 

he um 

ah 

in the way that we do 

the super modelling overall nuts that's kind of what i'd like to 

and with i 

um 

and uh 

on 

what i forget a 

yeah 

i said i was going to tell you was artificial consciousness that's a 

of data assimilation killed we can provide comparative perception and i 

we have a bunch of alternative representations of the same model doing data some ocean from each other than we have self perception

 

could be called consciousness 

and of synchronization at a much lower level of figures and 

most theories of of conscious neural processing of second spike trains sentences to a higher level 

it's a connection but let's make 

i so on 

anyway i on 

questions 

hmmm 

thank you very much 

and the only 

so 

but 

us 

oh 

oh 

oh yes 

oh 

oh 

on 

well if we in what in what i'm calling weather prediction mode where we're nudged reality we don't have to worry about it
-----
 

armed 

if we disconnect from reality 

i on 

it doesn't run away 

ah 

and perfectly i can say this 

ah and 

why is theoretically 

um 

in 

paul care case critic 

case for the coefficients are positive 

um 

it doesn't get outside of of of 

a domain in which each model normally works 

ah i'm not trick can cover more intuition for memory now 

there's a 

yeah 

thank you 

i 

well no um 

just a little or insists on this 

just to move 

most efficiency

 

very limited ways so far 

oh 

with these weather prediction with his work 

whether p. d. models 

armed 

and on 

but on 

he's so far we've just use the simple boring log in 

more complicated machine 

the news to computational expensive 

okay as anything else 

the question was very technical sense 

do you use smart not worthy was my them a pickup 

all 

i am a 

i use a 

from all those and then also a supercomputer somewhere in germany i i 

they still actually table data from the climate mornings 

thanks 

okay thriller end systems and t. v.'s the simple piece everything's on the same computer 

the climate models that um 

we're still struggling with a question on 

there's a there's a climate model a couple were called oasis in europe

 

um 

and then kerr in the u. s. has a a a snake all data assimilation research to spread 

that's a it takes one copy of a model 

home 

cool own you can cause a truth another copy of the model calls and model 

because what's his identical twin experiments 

actually runs an ensemble of models for different purposes us so runs ensemble of models for the purpose of determining spread or background there 

which you need and common filtering she's waited of solutions for more done 

so we're trying to generalize all of us 

um 

and ah 

the o. e. z. a 

um 

i use no piece of software called es tool 

of my colleagues and holland's own use my lab 

um 

and the stochastic stuff i'm planning to use mathematica haven't gotten to have 

other stuff as import ran its every all over the place

 

it says as to 

do we 

r. s. 

those people but he's 

the d. s. tool 

yes this is the u. s. to or be a so it's d. s. toll systems yeah it's a i think it was popular in the nineties it's not even supported anymore and i have a number 

our topic show you 

but ill as you just arrest 

he's way would normally right 

simulate the media 

i 

or 

it's 

oh 

general questions 

so 

hmmm 

are there any 

conditions on the 

system so 

he is 

models that continues 

here 

in order to look like synchronization of 

all of us um 

so the patients more groom its others

 

ah 

hmmm 

okay i think it's about synchronization inside of oaxaca marwan per se 

on 

what's really what variables you couple 

it's usually 

oh 

i have overlooked the balloon bottle this 

i use or be that connections 

i worry about this 

businessman 

lucian 

the 

so 

so 

from backs of mortals 

you can look at your be used 

it's 

oh that's a highly non we 

structures versus 

simple researchers there must be some 

oh easy these secrets

 

um 

well i mean they're harder it has to do with 

oh 

my thesis is that synchronize ability has to do with internal 

synchronization when a system 

more internally synchronize something is easier is to synchronize with something else 

also if you have a high degree of coherence of what's terms 

ruptures 

of that tells you both something about the use of signals you something else 

and about what you need to observe 

which makes sense i mean 

whether you need to observe a store 

arms track 

high pressure centres something corner 

oh 

um 

so um 

ah 

the hardest systems to synchronize typically are hamilton in systems 

but you can get synchronization 

with hamilton system 

it's 

a different forms of synchronization 

ah 

but i'm not sure you to them 

i want to tell you about this different forms right now 

on 

ah 

well the one i found was where the current structures tend to occur in the same place 

but uh but everything else gets more spread out
