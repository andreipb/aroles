Description
Atomic samples with temperatures in the nanokelvin range, prepared by advanced methods 
of laser and evaporative cooling, offer unique opportunities to study a large variety 
of phenomena in complex quantum systems. The important degrees of freedom and parameters 
can be controlled in a way, not accessible to traditional quantum many-body systems. 
Both bosonic and fermionic atoms are available to create Bose-Einstein condensates, 
degenerate Fermi gases, and even quantum-degenerate mixtures. Optical traps allow the 
experimentalists to realize macroscopic traps, artificial crystals (“optical lattices”), 
and low-dimensional environments. The interaction can be magnetically tuned exploiting 
a resonance phenomenon, called “Feshbach resonance”. Based on this rich tool-box, many 
intriguing model systems can be experimentally studied with strong connections to 
different branches of physics. After a general introduction into the field, I will 
present a few examples based on research in Innsbruck, including new developments on 
strongly interacting Fermi gases and few-body “Efimov” states in Bose gases.
