now welcome everybody it's a great great 

pleasure and honour for me to be here 

and review the first scientific presentation i think this year and the user stefan days 

and on the thinky organisers for inviting media 

most were giving me the opportunity to learn more about the institute and its research 

an entire u. c. v. 

introductory slight 

a where i put 

the title of my talk politics slovenian huh 

in the program 

um spiritual tied in english is given here 

so um i want to talk about 

what you can do with other called atoms 

it's a very broad field now there are many many groups worldwide working with is called atoms hundreds of groups

 

and um so 

and i want to use um 

very basic ideas 

why this is interesting and the main interest to step you can drift wonderful model kits at hand 

to build 

condensed matter system so many body systems 

and i will present a few examples 

on this 

okay in the background you see in spoke 

but now i'm in the snow is almost gone 

um but in spoke is a 

about effective tool smaller 

and we are not yeah 

in terms of you have intense also in terms of students it's almost exactly a factor of two 

and tom our kind of research 

there is quantum physics in a general sense 

it's kind of a focus area of them 

and we have strong activities pose a university his you see the universe to global 

and 

at an additional research institute which is the institute of austin academy of sciences 

the institute for quantum optics of quantum information 

so i call it 

the centre for quantum physics in in spoken we have about 

hundred eighty persons 

working in the fields in unions book oh three a huge 

a activity 

so what what 

a way that tell you and how's my talk or organised 

the overview is this 

article quantum grass us

 

i really want to give you a very basic 

introduction 

into the general ideas of to field 

and knowing that there are not many experts young 

and then 

i just selected 

two recent examples 

um which 

yeah illustrate this i think nicely 

and um so these are two examples 

and one is 

so one example one is on the bows aside 

the side of pole zones is on the side of from humans 

and this more connects to some old ideas from nuclear physics 

and disconnect small to the condensed matter physics

 

so the first one is about fifteen months quantum states 

i'm not sure whether it be body has heard about these yippee more states 

on and on the other one is songs on for me gases was very strong interactions 

so let me start out with a general 

the very very general ideas 

on the other called quantum grasses 

um so this is some 

technique how most of the experiments and all that stuff

 

but there's an organ filled with some materials so you will be your own 

sometimes strong see on a deal 

and to heat at a different temperatures 

and then we start out with an atomic been 

which has is so 

yeah distribution of law cities 

and down usually they're very fast ever few hundred meters per second and so on 

the first step 

and is something that was developed in the eighties already 

is to slow it only been down 

by using the resonance radiation pressure 

multiple hold on scattering and momentum transfer from laser light 

and if you scatter 

let's say a few ten thousand photons 

and tom 

then you can slow down to being one to distance off let's say me tell half a meter 

and the other the atoms which uh slowed down to 

just a few meters per second atomic been 

slovenia nurse at develop intimate

 

a piece already 

then we have slow at times 

next step 

we 

capture them here 

in that trap 

now imagine you have laser beams from all sides him of acting chairman laser beams coming from all sides 

and if you choose the right 

polarisation to choose right magnetic field 

and you play some tricks to write frequency 

i don't want to go to all these details here 

but then you can 

capture the atoms 

and you accumulate them 

and within a few seconds you can accumulate let's a billion of atoms there 

and these atoms then have typically amelie kelvin sometimes a little bit less 

um of temperature here 

but that's what we call them that many do optical 

a trap 

and tom 

then next 

you take these atoms prepared here 

and you transfer them into another type of trap 

traps mate with our made out of electromagnetic fields 

and of two types 

one type which is very common 

is a magnetic trap 

when you build the right set coils 

and you create a local meaning the of to mean eddie field and then you can trap 

sudden atoms which underwrite spin state 

okay and this potential listen a conservative potentially don't know long run 

and get a light 

and um in in this way 

you can do for the experiments i'm going to talk about and 

interesting trend in the field 

and s. in particular in austria and then a very strong group which pioneering 

works meet my school 

they can integrate these things and build on chip 

little a magnetic traps and is a very flexible tool 

too many parade them 

and also many ideas to use t. strap that them stand 

and with local potential well center cool them to the ground state use this 

for quantum computation schemes 

we are interested mainly in another type of trap 

so called optical bible traps 

the basic idea is very simple 

the most simple trap 

just taken 

infrared laser beam now you can buy

 

hundred watt five l. a. is a 

um had 

yeah way things total one thousand sixty nine readers uh so you focus them 

if you turn michael meter 

then you can use to light 

to cut steel plates 

i six grams 

but you can also use the same light 

to trap atoms of non locality temperatures 

so the atoms don't have any resonance lying down so there's no 

bresnan interactions 

and so a peak 

a nice laser light 

ah will simply create a 

potential well

 

and the main mechanism is stated that it would you be off resin and lie polarizers the atoms and any other type of false attracting them 

too many mark 

after like that so it's a very simple tool and we use it very often 

in the labor it or 

you can modify this a little bit you can make it a bit 

a guy more 

elaborate you can cross to beans and then you have an nearly

 

isa tropic trapping volume here 

and you can create standing waist 

here's one illustration 

is a standing wave pattern 

where you can confine 

adams and use pancake tightly us 

understanding in this anyway 

but is a way for example to create 

a two dimensional 

the system 

i hear these pancake type traps 

because i'm a particular emphasis i will talk a little bit 

about this 

okay but 

i've talked a little bit of a laser cooling just for 

used to the very basic ideas 

but laser cooling does not get cold enough you don't reach quantum generously 

um and i'm told out few orders of magnitude interface based density

 

i'm missing 

you have to do another thing is a cooling is limited by your effects item one talk about this 

but what you then do 

something 

but you conceptually all know 

and in the morning you're the hot coffee cup 

and how you call it 

you blow away be 

um vapor steam on loan so chris and d. holding cools 

is about schooling
-----
 

and we have to adam strapped now in a trap 

this is just a 

and park summation harmonic potential we have the atoms with 

the optimal energies 

and now you start to selectively remove 

adams added 

above a certain entity shredder old 

there are certain tricks to do it the most simple ways just your afternoon laser beam 

rant on the power of your laser beam 

and these atoms escape 

now it's important 

the rest here 

so analyses 

keeps on formalise in always produces some atoms 

which have more 

energy than the other ones and then be much more energy 

and the other ones have an average so you're of atoms 

but here we have much more energy 

okay and you you can keep the peace process is ongoing 

actually although wide ranging in some experiments we even reduce the whole potential effect of one thousand 

and then you get really cold 

at the end you lewis maybe ninety nine percent of the atoms sometimes ninety nine point nine 

but the rest that you have is extremely cold none of kelvin 

and it reaches stand 

quantum degenerate see

 

okay that means 

if i do this with 

warzones 

what happens is suppose einstein compensate is formed 

and yeah 

some early citing suppose einstein condensation in nineteen ninety five 

the group of a condo wyman in boulder candle a group at m. i. t. v. 

and you see the onset of a bowes einstein condensation 

so what are these images 

first of all how we detect this 

what we do is to read in most of the experiments we released the atoms from the trap 

the trap was turned off 

and then the cloud expands 

and then we take a snapshot of a cloud 

even a analysing the fluorescence all their absorption 

and from these images of density profile 

we can extract the temperature 

and if it is a solo gas

 

that's a song logos 

then it's simply a gaussian shaped cloud 

and you can expect the temperature 

then if you reach pose einstein condensation 

you have these 

background which is still has a form of ago also but there's a peak on top of that 

and they speak on top of that 

that's the 

population and oppose einstein common said 

it's much more narrow when you keep on calling then you can reach 

states where you have 

more than ninety or ninety five percent 

in divorce einstein conversation

 

pew of was einstein compensated 

which you see here quite nicely 

similar behaviour is also shown 

here this is to be human 

and this is was sold you 

these was ninety five great breakthroughs 

but in in the field and a 

and cornell wyman kepler received two thousand one nobel prize for this achievement 

last year early experiments on was einstein condensation 

okay and now let me look into 

the year two thousand 

here's a periodic table 

on this side of marked the elements that have been pose a condensed at this time

 

rubio 

a review media so you're is here 

then there was an experiment at rice nearest only steal and hydrogen and kept us group 

all done in the united states 

if you look at the state owes 

now or or early this month 

then it looks 

much more diverse 

that looks like this 

yeah you see it's much more colourful 

and many more 

different countries mostly european achievements them 

many things have happened since then 

and now it's a 

senile twelfth 

species a market here 

then you can ask why do i need different species 

no one's ever compensate akin to experiment with this 

but they all different 

in terms of to interaction properties 

now they have interaction properties also optical transition schemes 

so it's really worse to have new species in the game when every new species 

a brought into conversation 

until now all 

has brought in some interesting new aspects of the field 

and um 

i will show some examples sees you sees you we were the first to condemn sees your beer 

and and 

that's a situation 

i said earlier this of months and we were very happy to just 

few weeks ago

 

we could also achieved to post condensation of human 

ah ah so we're very proud as a small country that we have three first condensation centre 

only u. s. is doing better at five first conversations 

it's a little bit like a they're climbing mountains have opposed to read the first one down 

and the neural interesting thing is that this is a very strongly magnetic species 

and you have very strong magnetic interactions between the atoms 

and as a topic and actions 

which is now a very interesting trend in the field to work with 

adams with his strong 

bipolar interactions 

okay it 

but ah this gives to the overview why all these ones empty their entry because

 

laser cooling doesn't work 

the laser cooling the bottleneck 

and you have to do you need close topical 

transition schemes where can scatter many many 

ten thousands of photons to make laser cooling work 

and these what you find with the of cali atoms of a cut in some other once maybe a few more candidates here 

ah but in general it's it's difficult so this is to bottleneck 

not about cool about going woodwork principle with any adam 

okay so now that we look into the from the gases from the gases 

now a few from the gas situation see on

 

brought into um 

he generously meaning 

have a nice from the scene 

and those two once a particular importantly human potassium most schools work with them 

and these have to um 

led to the achievement of molecular balls einstein condensation 

i'm a talk about this later when you pay other forms and bring them into condensation 

and to create from unix super foods 

i hope at the end of my talk i will have some time 

to speak about this

 

just to give you 

the overview here 

ah so this is something which is very important in the field of connects to 

a condensed matter physics 

you can create so called optical lattices simply by 

using laser beams 

creating standing waves interfering 

and then you can create for example in the treaty configuration 

the regular 

optical crystal 

new arrangement retrieving traps the atoms at 

sites 

which have we are and a half apart 

but these are so called optical lattices and many of the experiments um now done with optical lattices 

if you use one pale themes less 

then you can create 

nice one dimensional to stoops 

and there's not a lot of interesting experiments on the physics of one dimensional systems where can

 

realising very keen ways some 

and it only runs in 

in one d. and check what is going on 

and tom he has also something very important 

ah and is this a so called mott insulator phase transition 

normally once you load your balls einstein compensate into such a lattice without losing entropy if you do it right
-----
 

then you find 

that you have a certain distribution some sites you find 

one atom somewhere to somewhere between somewhere zero 

and so as a certain statistic to distribution 

but once you ramp up your leftist gaps 

okay no before i explain this 

and then you release your atoms can be spat on 

and then you see an interference pattern is also done in time or flight 

then to do distribution 

the news really see that friction peaks 

madam waved a fraction peaks 

from that you learned it's in this simple fluid stately have long range coherence 

over many left sites 

but once you drive your letter strongly i mean you crank it up to power of the lettuce 

then you will see suddenly this 

then you get a well defined mumbai it's one poolside 

in the lattice 

and then the clearance disappears 

and the defection happens gone 

and you say okay now 

maybe i just have heated up a system now 

and um i've destroyed interference but then you do it this way and is an example means pork 

um this to work was done recently were strong so maybe four 

this is the balls of condoms eight 

you put it into a lattice 

then it becomes a solo fluid in the left isn't shows that fraction peaks 

now you crank up the lattice power 

you and then you see a death action pending disappears 

okay to question is reversible 

and here you see yes 

if you could have a number of the lettuce down 

then you get again 

um you reverse your quantum phase transition 

and then you get your 

interference pattern back 

and so this transition to as to what insulated amok in so it has a very interesting starting point

 

for many 

experiments 

okay so this is another thing which is a new development 

i told you already that all images we show a density distributions where's implicate 

the laser pulse into the operators and then 

monroe image the absorption profile up to cloud 

and but now 

it's that has 

been developed such a sophisticated leather 

the money's even 

capable of detecting single atoms and addressing those sites

 

really see this is a picture formed 

marcus kind of open how about 

and a view taken really see 

the distribution in such a lattice 

and they can only talk 

i mean yes um empty sites that you see 

and these is to reconstruct a pet on 

and you can also many plates and you can light so compact comes 

it's very sophisticated here 

you for example you see a shell in the mott insulator 

they have won adam

 

the two atoms are gone you can remove him by certain tricks so it's 

really the level now the feud has sent as approach 

okay what next 

that is very important 

a interaction between the atoms without interactions it's quite boring 

but we have interactions 

and the interaction that 

such low temperature 

a completely dominated by s. with behaviour 

so there are no higher partial waves really both the scattering 

and turned 

so we can 

as you know textbook that

 

yes where scattering is characterised but yes we're scattering and 

so actually we need to know one parameter 

and we know 

almost everything about interaction 

yes where scattering length 

okay question is can we control it do we haven't handled all mop and experiment can say now i want to have very small scattering lines and the change it now a big scattering lens 

now i want to carry a tune from negative to positive does this exist 

and and this is something that came into the field 

about twelve years ago 

before i mean we just have to use what nature gives to our star 

yeah but then we learned about so called fish for resonances 

i don't want to go to the details of these resonance but the refresh resonant depends on the magnetic field 

something that he feels access 

and it's a magnetic field values you will find 

resonances 

and if you plot the s. where scattering ninety eight has a background behaviour 

and some certain field range it can go 

shows such at this person shaped resonance behaviour 

described by such an expression 

and what you have to learn about your certain species that you use 

where to find peace resonances 

and this is complicated because these okay these line is a molecular state what happens here is to the molecular state in a close channel 

a approaches the threshold couples and his mahdi feisty whole scattering problem 

you have to learn a lot about molecular physics 

to understand these special resonance structure 

um so fortunate to re a very good collaborations people understanding this 

and they can really if we could give them 

experimental observations on certain resonance spectrum they can understand it model it and

 

predict and scattering length 

versus magnetic field 

is well advanced and now we have for many of these species combinations 

a nice fresh resonances and is extremely important 

for all of our experiments 

okay 

now this is a typical situation in the lab 

so you see it's tabletop experiments here's a laser table 

a graduate student working on setting up amaze us

 

and then we put optical fibers to the neighbouring table and a you find equipment 

and the vacuum operator so everything has to be done in a dry vacuum 

and once you get it running 

the first stage you get a nice so these who spot here 

is am i need to optical trap optically terps to consume 

fluorescent looks very nicely 

and these are the magnetic field coils 

and all the rest this lot of optics and to control electronics and so on 

okay you can also trapped in the same volume two speeches 

but there's a strong soon 

and the other one is the human 

and then it's getting very interesting because you you mix to specious here we have 

artificially separated them to show this 

but you can combine them and then you can do many interesting things based on the interspecies interactions 

for example you can form 

into a nuclear molecules from them 

and to work with these molecules is also very important 

trend now 

here is our newest 

child i would say the of your money to optical trap you see 

he a nice car lights between yellow and green 

it's a european fluorescent in these experiments 

we had to choose to pose einstein compensate 

last 

early this did this month 

and and 

it's the team that's not how it's almost a year old but to give you an impression we are both turkey person to the group 

um and behold rule working on seven different 

a machines 

and he uh the principal investigators in the group

 

ah that's a units from cesc are following along 

with few of them experiments 

and uh floor amtrak strong soon 

and christoph mango was yeah 

molecules aussies you men so on 

and then my activity so we organised in such a way 

but we have a 

for p. i. isn't it 

in the other called group 

and now i want to okay tell you 

little bit more multi my first example 

what are these yippee more quantum states 

mysterious you've team of quantum states actually 

for this paper appeared

 

by nineteen seventy enough a teacher forty 

creed forty two years ago 

a forty two years ago 

on on 

on 

on live t. english translation young weekly bone states of three resonant interacting particles 

and these wasn't idea driven by he was working at a nuclear physics institute in thinking about 

what i'm what happens if i have some 

nuclear on sunday interact 

a pairwise but the scattering length is extremely large 

and uh so you found something 

which is drawn here 

i mean explain it in more detail 

and you see knowledge is just a collection of some recent papers

 

now it's an extremely active research field of many groups are now studying 

if you will states and these things 

so what happened 

i actually yeah it's a bit early few more few visited in spoke 

in two thousand nine 

and time 

here's the operators actually where the first time ever traces of his 

a quantum states have been seen 

i was very interesting moment for us to have been visiting 

ah okay but now what is a story 

stories the following what is plotted here's the energy 

and this is the inverse scattering lengths so here the scattering things divergence here's a resonance 

or can if you start with the two body picture 

and what you get on the positive 

scattering side 

is a rebound i'm a state 

now have a very shallow diner was extremely weak binding energy and this is a dime or state
-----
 

is well known 

but now to this situation 

let's add a third part of particle 

okay then business 

these so called adam diamond threshold 

you can have a dime or free adam 

but what now happens below threshold 

this is the interesting thing 

and is pretty would predict that lady theme off you get a wiki pound try messed eight 

which follows about 

the photos this red line is the energy that we keep on trying man 

and it surprising thing is once you get such a week debunked right now 

and you change your length scale by a factor of twenty two point seven 

then you get another try 

okay in my drawing it's a fact that we have produced to to affect of to its effect of twenty two point seven

 

it's an even more we could bomb it has the same 

kind of geometry in behavior 

only delaying scaleless different perfect of twenty two point seven 

yeah but that's not all actually another factor twenty two point seven you get another one 

and and so the prediction wasn't in finite serious of these states 

and witty scaling factor twenty two point seven is a v. fuming states and they have several 

very 

counterintuitive and puzzling properties and there was a reason why 

when you first years he works if you was kind of protected it's wrong was he predicting you couldn't be and so on 

but it turned out to be right 

all those two theoreticians wanted to pull from 

wrong actually confirm his theories 

and uh so one region interesting region is this one 

this is a region where you don't have the two body problem state at least not a shallow one

 

but you can have as we body bounced it 

it's a so can borrow only in reaching 

and they are 

examples a nuclear physics like only human eleven 

a nucleus where you have a vision nine core enter throughout the neutrons 

whenever you remove one of the new tunes the other one 

it's also in stable and goes away and it's a brawl mewn state 

this is no nuclear physicist is not a new remote state doesn't qualify 

and you feel more state but just want to show that their concepts 

nuclear physics 

and turn 

this is another thing i want to mention briefly 

there was a long series of experiments looking for this yippee more states in helium 

in his urine 

i'm in your molecules 

on his was done by men by tenuous encoding and 

over d. k. torso and they try to find easy theme or states

 

by looking at their fraction pattern repeated abuse 

but finally unfortunately standard for the last paper and two thousand five you can cruise italy 

we have to begin landed 

we have to begin run tuition called atoms 

we can change the scattering and 

they have to live with the scattering langford the system has and they're lucky to find some state 

but we can control it 

that's the main point 

okay so coming back to the call adam experiments 

a what is a look so how do we see peace if you most states 

and there's an elementary process called tree body recommendations 

three atoms come together 

and then tool for paul mode i'm error 

and the other one this remains of three adam 

and the binding energy is just taking away with the kinetic energy here 

and these tree body recombination 

and actually industry body recrimination this is also the and experiment

 

so if this happens 

these particles are lost from a trap 

okay so what we measure this loss 

versus magnetic field meaning of loss versus 

scattering length 

and okay i don't want to go deep into sear we just want to say there's a loss was proportional to the 

density cute 

because a tree body were combination 

and you can express it in this way 

there is a 

background behaviour it strongly depends on the scattering lengths of the force power 

so you have if you have systems was large scattering names 

you run into problems with his we body decayed 

ah that's true football zones 

but as a prefect on the prefect on 

it is interesting broker because a prefect on is also function of a 

and you find something like this 

he'll find these precepts taught 

well these function c. o. a. 

this is a 

is and number was making periodic function you find

 

is factor of twenty two point seven a 

here you see really cheesy theme of type physics 

when you measure these c. averse verses a 

you can see 

if you know physics 

and to um okay 

okay john 

with this but what is now wrong 

observable in this scenario 

here are the stadium people state comes to the threshold 

this causes 

pronounced resonance 

that means it's very very low energy use non though

 

kelvin business 

picchu a little wallet energies 

i mean be atoms approach each other 

and then they formed a chief he will stay 

this opens up a channel 

to foster body decay 

okay these calls a resonance 

actually 

couple of years ago in two thousand six 

we could observe such a resonance 

and what you see here is a 

a somehow the loss 

versus the scattering length of time on the negative side 

you really see there's a pronounced resonance here 

which fits nicely 

is the resonance of the available theory 

just two primary to fit 

and this was a first very clear indication 

of existence of such a you fuel state

 

meanwhile we have 

measured many more quantities related to be a few more physics other groups 

i worked on this and this is now 

the whole scenario 

i would say 

the smallest confirmed s. um quantitative questions regarding correction and so on 

but this is confirmed now 

okay and i just want to give you some idea of some recent experiments we did 

in scenes human 

are we 

but if you plot p. 

scattering lang's versus magnetic field it looks like this 

um roughly 

and previously worked in this middle region yeah 

now we are 

have the capability to apply much higher magnetic fields 

and the other resonances here 

and we can check 

whether the same type of behaviour 

that we observed here shows up here or there

 

and to um 

these are some recent observations and actually be find in different magnetic field regions we find p. c. c. morph resonances 

and ah there's one 

a very interesting question 

i mean there was a long debate in the field about a so called tree body parameter 

which is in charge 

indeed if you move prediction tells you that piece infinite serious assayed should exist

 

but it doesn't tell you where it stops 

and where it has a starting point that it's a so called tree body primary tenant 

and some theorist 

tell you 

this is a priori unknown you cannot predicted it comes from short range physics and so on 

and um 

and it will be different 

for any to body resonance you find a different we body parameter 

and and 

so but the other arguments wire on maybe it should be in the 

the other way and 

so we we looked i mean not not in any biased way we just observe our 

if you morph resonances for different body resonances 

and then we found if you compare our old observation that low field 

was a scattering lines 

with the 

new observation that i feel that 

is he the behavior looks to saint 

and you find a resonance at 

the value of the scattering lengths 

minus nine hundred boring here 

which is essentially the same with india of us 

and we did this on call different resonance us 

and we find that 

is only one tense of the fifteen period so these almost the same 

a small variations and was in the air of us 

it has the same tree body parameter 

and this really positive some serious and they had to rethink what is going on 

and i think it's now 

it's on that it's at least also picasso systems is understood what is going on as a new type of universality
-----
 

for the atomic systems 

and the three body parameters determined by it 

one of us interaction actually 

very long range interactions are to the minus six one of ours 

and these coefficient then determines 

these three body primary 

this was a surprising 

development 

in the field and we could contribute to this 

okay i'm sure in the team 

into the lab oratory 

again with no honorary member 

and and then just a last

 

thing so what is going on now all 

now we 

look into a more generalised situations 

uh there are predictions on more general few body states 

for body five bodies six body cluster states 

and we observed very kissing inches of four body states and now we can even detect 

five body states 

causing resonances 

and do the positions where they occur in terms of midi field and scattering is 

very nicely fit to universal theory 

and so this this um 

some recent development and then in general i want to make the point

 

that um 

a few bodies physics is one example from lettuce on experiments 

that that understanding cream body interactions 

it's very very important and interesting also to understand and am anybody problem 

approach to many pro pro form 

unless it into what is rewarded for the interaction 

and i must have been too many body problem and you can use it you can exploit it also to create 

new quantum phases 

an optical at this and is a nice 

example 

so few what interaction inserts conclusion of to spot a very important to understand and controlled

 

anybody physics 

so that was my 

first example 

on what we can do with a cold atoms 

the second one is on strongly interacting for me gas us which is close i would say to them 

condensed matter side 

and in some very simple illustration of a two component 

for me gas 

you see you have some 

read guys here and here little guy so these are 

adams 

and in 

most of the experiments 

a dead distinguishable

 

i mean all the same with the same color i indistinguishable identical performance 

and what makes ten distinguish rule is 

a different internal spin state 

we can prepare some book 

in different incomes spin states 

and so it's a two component mixture why are we doing that because we want to use 

s. with interaction 

at very low temperatures on p. wave is completely neglect negligible 

we want to have s. way from direction devil we need 

one identical particles interacting 

okay and so this one interesting and as an interesting regime 

what happens if you have an s. way scattering lengths between these particles 

and you increase it 

use of cash for residents 

and you turn it to let's say infinity 

so the t. s. were scattering becomes much larger as compared to the inter particle distance 

then you create a firm tonic 

many body system 

in contrast to bowls of gases and that's an interesting point

 

and these systems very stable 

the bulls of galveston you get enormous problems which we body became a case like crazy when you tune up scattering and 

in the front of gaza's it's different 

the system becomes 

come even very stable 

and the reason is that they are 

from rooms 

and for three body vendor newt re particles and with you in your free particles two of them are identical 

and best polly blocking suppressing the decay 

so this is a stable situation 

in the from a gas 

okay so actually there are some similarities and the regime that we can realise and love oratory 

this very closely related to a neutron star to the crust of a neutron star 

but you have to situation spin up and spin down neutrons 

with a very large scattering lenders 

large competitive and uh particle spacing 

this cross can be super fluid new principal fluidity and so on 

and this is some regime we can realise into that

 

and so sometimes when we have general public is ignorant social them a new topic of trapped of 

small that 

ball in the and tell you don't look as a model for the neutron star in a vacuum operators 

and we can now 

investigate this in different ways we can squeeze is that it also late and so on investigator properties 

but you can never do wouldn't and stuff 

that's nice can controllability of the system 

okay it coming back to this picture unity interest in question is one use this to question what happens now 

if lay 

increased a scattering lens if the tuna to infinity 

by bridging scattering 

what happens 

it's not known in the field is broached problem 

actually what happens this relatively simple 

and these scattering lengths blocks a dazzling scale 

and you can describe the system in terms of a re normalise chemical potential 

where you have a primary down

 

see tell you 

no question is what is the value of two seater 

and now it's kind of can working towards o. point three seven thirteen attractive situation 

the gas gets more dense 

um but in many different respects behaves as if the war said monday informing us 

and so the properties of such a firmly gus 

ah 

i have been investigated in many many experiments in the last few years 

and this is quite well understood situation 

ah now 

ah and the experiments have really pushed a lot 

a series 

mainly 

dark wonder wonder carlo series tie dramatic of coaches and conan really giving

 

precise benchmarks to further develop series 

in this field so nice example about the interplay of experiment 

interior 

on the complicated than anybody problem 

okay coming to the experiments we know these things with me from six atoms 

we use a low as dizzy one diagram willows use a combination of telos to space states 

it's a classical combination that many groups are now using it 

in the world 

and what you find various natures very kind to you 

because there's a broad an extremely broad fresh resonance 

which is 

hundreds of gauze wind and snow extremely well characterised 

so we now wield the position of the poll does it is within 

less than adults 

and so we can extremely precisely 

but you know scattering lens using these resins 

okay 

so we have a fantastic injection control not 

and let's say we go to his regime look very large positive scattering things and we can form 

these ricky bond diamonds 

onto body objects molecules 

strange kind of molecules 

okay business operators we have again attracting sham of vacuum here

 

and here 

there's a simplified scheme what happens 

at the end it's just a pair of coils 

and it's a laser beam 

and his laser beams ramp down 

and these samples of africa to cool 

and then when you tune to the right wing any feel what you see is this and is the onset of molecular was einstein condensation 

some apart 

was einstein condensation of these payout from young's 

and then these forms and monica doubles einstein compensate 

this was achieved for the first time in two thousand three 

in spoke at m. i. t. and you'd boulder 

a boulder was protesting forty atoms 

and to us so this molecular be 

excellent starting point for 

through the things 

ah so this brings me to the so called b. c. b. c. s. cross a physics 

ah so we have here the bows aside
-----
 

we have a trap was bowl zones we have here trap was strongly owns 

and he had forms keep was zero balls are compensated 

all in the wrong state 

here just homes astronomy see 

filled up to the tommy energy level 

okay 

looks like a completely different physics 

but actually 

it is 

these two different worlds you seemingly different worlds 

are connected 

by interaction 

and there's this moves crossover between these situations 

and town so the key to understand is is pairing 

the regime was when you have two of these guys and they compare up informal composite bows on which we call a molecule 

but you can have molecular was einstein condensation 

if the interaction is a different kind of um negative scattering length

 

then prince where you can get codebook paris 

and it becomes a 

kind of the super fluid 

similar to 

now of normal super conductors with electrons 

and turned away to control it is a scattering length 

so we have these wonderful scattering length 

we can tune on top of the residence where we get this universal from a gas 

um which has been subject of many investigations for the can also explore different regimes 

and it's a crossover gas and sometimes 

we also call it a high p. c. super fluid 

and you might you may find it funny a high p. c. system at the say

 

a typical e. two hundred non okay lean condition temperature 

so it's not heidi see in absolute terms of course 

it's heidi see in terms of to for me temperature 

and these systems become superfluid it 

twenty percent of the from the temperature 

in this respect it's it's heidi scene 

and term many experiments have explored this a different groups 

we also contribute it by looking at collective modes 

shake the system would begin sauce to date and then you see 

when you change index which then how the how the frequency changes 

and here we see 

it's a superfluid regime

 

where it is hydrodynamics 

and here it's just a collision this regime when sonoma from a gas 

many experiments and then 

superfluid he was finally firmly established 

but a group of a catalan see a line at m. i. t. 

sunday up so of what you see is really formed and informing us 

and this fits very nicely to the old picture 

and so this is now fairly well understood situation 

i just want to make these common it's the b. c. b. a. b. c. s. crossovers now also honour 

quantitative level 

very well understood 

forty quincy raw there are some remaining issues some finite temperature behaviour 

there are many open issues regarding what i wear when you could do it now into bjorn one b. 

and is now what some groups i very actively exploring 

um 

but let me come to 

another 

new crunchy and to feel that something we are investigating 

he's a so called for me from a mixture strongly interacting systems made of 

different species not different spin state but you read it a completely different species 

and look at the interactions

 

and a experiments who are going on in a pin in spoke 

unix in singapore amsterdam 

m. i. t. in s. paris 

and perhaps another 

oops i'm not aware of 

and so this is something i've 

sean already we have two different 

spin states 

now would change the situation now we have these big guys of the small guys 

and these are different species

 

and then you ask wise is interesting 

lies is now interesting to just use another species like mused it can spin states 

it's interesting because there's the mass in balance 

once you have different masses in the system 

then you can have a 

asymmetric face diagrams new phrases occurring 

so it opens really a way of new quantum phrases in in these systems 

and you can ask additional few body states 

a bit beyond a certain critical mass ratio 

these conform boundary body objects 

and it's not for equinox 

so there's also you can with tight physics 

in this system possible 

and the other thing which i find also very exciting is 

species selectivity 

so what does it mean this means 

i can now create 

optical trapping potentials 

which are only seen by one species and not by the other one 

so i can do funny things i can have a

 

one d. system 

of one to munich species immersed in a 

treaty ought to be system or the other one 

so systems was mixed dimensionality 

and as a strong trend now what's realising such 

a mixed the systems 

really the independent possibility to manipulate the speeches 

okay now all cases put us in forty and issued six 

um there's not much choice and a former world but we work with 

these two ones 

and you may ask is there again interaction control

 

and this is something actually a question we asked ourselves for 

maybe three years was very hard to figure this out 

but finally we know it is 

and as a relatively nice resonance love very broad 

at me a hundred fifty five wrongs 

and here you see how we changed elastic scattering cross section 

using such a resin his his residence 

here's the resonance poll 

here's a zero crossing 

and so we have these resins now very well 

under control 

but since the species was new nobody knew the scattering properties 

and we had to start from scratch 

exploring scattering properties 

identifying resonances 

having this here is helping us to understand all this and

 

it was a process which took three years 

but now it's understood 

and 

and there's a little secret you see it you know these red points 

and how some blue points 

the blue data points this no resonance 

but what is the difference 

differences of spin state combination 

okay have to look into the semen diagram fully human sin potassium actually resonances when 

this year isn't a lower state 

and put testing within the serbs too low state 

okay 

and now comes the interesting point 

we can very easily by using radio frequency methods 

change the speed state 

we can drive coherent oscillations robbie australasians 

do not type things and so on it's a very rich

 

a toolbox that we have using to review frequency methods 

and the interesting thing is now we can easily switch on 

non interacting too strongly interacting 

that's very important simply by flipping the spin state 

using radio frequency 

okay that brings me to the 

last humanist experiments that we did on polar arms 

on this is not something that's colourful but it's maybe a little bit complicated the situation is that 

just read because the optical polarize ability of the species 

the trap for potassium was two times deeper than police you use the same laser 

but the potential protesting seizes two point one times deeper 

demolition sees 

they we have many molly hume adams to from the energy is much higher 

this brings us to the situation that we have a small cloud of potassium 

sitting in a huge cloud of lithium six 

so on 

and so this is close to regime and we can optimise to probably doesn't this way 

that we have the protesting for the atoms as impure eighties 

sitting in the pharmacy of mayhew six 

okay on this apollo on agree gene 

but in purity stand can become polar owns 

and it's a system of heavy in purity's 

the pharmacy of light atoms 

this was the wrong button okay
-----
 

and so now the question is a fuller you haven't in purity uniform you see 

what happens 

okay 

if you are off resonance 

you have some background interaction 

and is this something you can understand in terms of 

simple mean field approach 

can be a little repulsive or attractive mean field 

okay simple mean field description work score 

if these primates are 

for me ways 

number time scattering men's dimensionless parameters smaller than one 

if we approach know the resonance 

then it's getting more complicated then you get strong expectations and for me see you create particle whole past nice things

 

and then you can no longer described in terms of simple mean field 

and apollo on a description works very well 

so that you really have to consider that the particle now 

distorts the foreman c. and creates expectations 

you can describe it of the choir that particle 

when you go very close to resonance does another question 

then you're also 

have a strong rate of formation of molecules of time spent you simply early hume adam 

a protest in purity grab silly hume adam out of the pharmacy 

they form and i'm now 

and then you have kind of a molecule expectation 

and the question is yeah 

will appear 

caller all molecule 

weather conditions 

okay and we explore this and we now to see a human potassium teen the experimentalists here 

in in the lab 

oh to make stone he recalled liberate us 

and uh so actually this work 

out very well with the polar on some on some interesting

 

new states 

and i'm very happy that we got our paper now last week except that 

intonation onto 

repulsive polaroids 

um so what is the basic idea 

now this is what the series tell you how it looks like 

it is 

negative scattering lengths here attractive situation but is a st. attractive polo on 

on on the other side 

it's repulsive interaction 

and they receive 

a increase of the energy when you approach the resonance

 

ah 

then here and this grey shaded area 

this comes from the molecule formation 

it's a continuum because that potassium adam can grab and 

hume adam from the bottom up from the sea 

all the primary energy level and therefore 

it needs to continue move different states 

and desist he's shaded area yeah 

continuum some states 

and then you see 

that the apollo a mix tape here 

then year crosses 

the low energy threshold of the little a citation 

and then you know in this case here 

it can be k. apollo wrong can decay into monica wright cetaceans 

yes some other cetaceans from e. c. 

it's a so called paulo on molecule courtroom 

are crossing and he is expected to 

disappear 

it's to repulsive one 

and it's becoming the prediction increasingly unstable when you're forged a resonance because candy cane to molecular like citations 

also 

he checked of cologne 

so i mentioned already okay this is what i explained already 

how can we investigate this and we do it now by these radio frequency spectroscopy methods

 

we prepare the situation 

first of all the non interacting spin state 

and then we apply a radio frequency policy 

and we drive it into the store named acting state 

then we take a spectrum 

by varying the frequency and also the main field of the system 

and we can then have access to the whole 

except patient spectrum of the system 

and then it looks like this

 

yeah very v. scattering lens 

here i see in a spectrum media 

now was false color plot here 

and we see that it goes up here 

shifted up and use attractive site where they 

said sue where there 

situation disappears simon deposed apollo on it except patient disappears 

and if we 

compare this with scenery 

it fits quite nicely into disappearances where the polar encore moniker crossing is 

and here it's easy to be repulsive polar own 

in particular the repulsive polo on this was a really in using attractive poland had been seen before 

but to repulsive polo on that acquires i particle relying on 

repulsive interactions 

that had been seen for the first time yeah

 

and that is the particular interest you after puzzles pull on 

and just briefly when you crank up the power now we give the system hundred times more wider frequency power 

and you see a very broad spectrum and what you see here 

these all pay expectations 

these are we own molecular expectation these are kind of many body pairs 

and these spectrum also very nicely fits into what pete 

expect here 

another coming back to the repulsive paulo on 

that's the main object of interest 

and it was the predicted that it decays 

and we record time in years of decay 

and we could just by designing the right way you frequency pulse sequence little bit like 

and in my experiments 

we could measure its lifetime 

watch it's t. k. 

the driver pipe pause to create and then we wait 

and if it still lives we can drive it back into a 

into the other spin state 

and so we can get my lifetime can can measure the lifetime

 

here's some lifetime cross and years as versus interaction 

all measured values 

this is something close to resonance off 

half a millisecond 

which is in terms of to from the energy relatively long 

and these are two different theoretical approaches and you see that's understood quite 

well 

and that pleasant surprise was 

that these polar on a kick cetaceans 

show quite a long lifetime 

it was not expected 

um and experiments on the mission six system and they show all of magnitude less lifetime

 

and we found out that in these systems for reasons which a little bit complicated to explain one point is a mass different the other one is a special 

character of the resonance 

the system is much more long lived 

and now 

on the question it's nice that interesting 

and i try to explain it in a very few words 

there's a big question on the field 

well when you have a two component from your system and ukraine cup 

increased are positive direction 

will you get stay separation 

will it do to separate so there's a competition between d. 

a repulsion 

and also the from the energy 

we as a separate all will instead 

molecule formation win and the system will become work to do molecular system 

they had been experiments at m. i. t. 

showing that this one wins here 

but now with a factor of ten different lifetime that we have in the system 

actually it seems that 

something like this we would 

we have some preliminary results indicating 

kind of a three phase mixture of 

up to two different species class the layoff molecules in between them 

but is very early on the moon to make too strong claims 

but this factor of ten that we got in a lifetime 

really helps us 

a lot and is another 

example where you 

and now we're approaching with her daughter called atoms 

questions which some are which made from condensed matter that skilled stone a problem yeah 

other this is possible 

okay i think i 

finished up my time 

just time for brief conclusion 

the general conclusion is

 

a hot or cold atoms off on 

unique 

when a controllable very clean modern systems 

with which you can address many different questions one 

condensed matter physics quantum anybody physics even nuclear physics 

strong interacting quantum matter in general 

and few body to problems 

and ah then the experiments 

they can give us exquisite benchmarks also to test series 

and further developed 

theoretical approaches 

and this has a 

so an already shown very great potential rundown many activities going on now
