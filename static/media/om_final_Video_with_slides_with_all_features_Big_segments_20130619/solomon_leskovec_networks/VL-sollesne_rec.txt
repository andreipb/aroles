VL-sollesne 0.00 3.17 s0001 SO THANKS FOR THE INVITATION AND FOR EVERYTHING SO UM 
VL-sollesne 3.18 5.23 s0001 THE PLAN FOR TODAY STOCK EAST 
VL-sollesne 5.24 8.26 s0001 IS THAT WE DO THINK ABOUT UM 
VL-sollesne 8.27 16.00 s0001 BASICALLY HOW TO THINK ABOUT STRUCTURE OF NETWORK SO THIS IS THIS IS THE OF THE BOTTOM LINE AND THEN I PLAN TO SORT OF WALK YOU THROUGH A FEW 
VL-sollesne 16.02 17.64 s0001 A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS SO 
VL-sollesne 17.64 20.11 s0001 I WILL START AT THE BEGINNING RIGHT SO THE FIRST THING IS 
VL-sollesne 20.12 22.07 s0001 WELL I GET NETWORKS RIGHT THEN 
VL-sollesne 22.07 27.86 s0001 BASICALLY THERE IS LOTS AND LOTS OF NETWORK OF DATA THAT CAN VERY NATURALLY BE PRESENTED AS NETWORKS RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 27.87 32.29 s0001 SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE JUST ONE EXAMPLE IN THERE ARE MANY MANY OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE 
VL-sollesne 32.29 39.00 s0001 WHERE YOU CAN TAKE SOME DAYTIME SORT OF THE MOST NATURAL WAY TO LOOK AT THAT KIND OF DATA EAST REPRESENTED DOES A GRAPH AS A SET OF 
VL-sollesne 39.01 41.86 s0001 BUT SHE SAYS ONSET AND A SET OF EDGES 
VL-sollesne 41.87 44.45 s0001 PARKS OR CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THESE NODES RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 44.47 46.07 s0001 YOU CAN LOOK AT SOCIAL NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 46.08 48.52 s0001 A RICH USE FACEBOOK'S AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
VL-sollesne 48.53 53.17 s0001 YOU CAN TAKE A COLLABORATION NETWORKS KNOW WHEN YOU'RE AN OLDER HUMAN SEND YOU CONNECT TO 
VL-sollesne 53.18 57.43 s0001 TO KNOW THAT IF THEY VOTE THE PAPER TOGETHER OR IF THEY COLLABORATED TOGETHER 
VL-sollesne 57.44 60.86 s0001 YOU CAN TAKE NETWORKS FROM CELL BIOLOGY SO BASICALLY YOU CAN TAKE 
VL-sollesne 60.87 62.45 s0001 PROTEINS OR GENES 
VL-sollesne 62.46 66.19 s0001 AS NODES AND YOU CAN ADD THEM IF THEY INTERACTIVE THEY WORK TOGETHER 
VL-sollesne 66.20 70.26 s0001 TO PRODUCE UM YOU PROTEIN OR SOMETHING RIGHT AND NOW YOU CAN STUDY HOW THE CELL WORKS 
VL-sollesne 70.27 74.03 s0001 THROUGH THE OF THE BY ANALYSING THOSE KINDS OF NETWORKS UM 
VL-sollesne 74.04 76.36 s0001 REDMOND CITATION NETWORKS IS ANOTHER 
VL-sollesne 76.37 78.59 s0001 ARE ANOTHER ARE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A VERY 
VL-sollesne 78.59 80.98 s0001 SIMPLE CASE OF NETWORKS RIGHT AND THEN 
VL-sollesne 81.00 84.98 s0001 A COMPUTER NETWORKS BASICALLY THE INTERNET HOW COMPUTERS TALK TO ONE ANOTHER 
VL-sollesne 84.99 87.52 s0001 AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS THOSE ARE ALL AGAIN 
VL-sollesne 87.52 91.18 s0001 KINDS OF DATA DATA THAT CONNECT NATURALLY BE PRESENTED DOES GET US 
VL-sollesne 91.19 92.64 s0001 RIGHT SO THIS IS BASICALLY 
VL-sollesne 92.65 94.15 s0001 THE DATA WILL BE WORKING WITH 
VL-sollesne 94.16 95.85 s0001 AND THEN THE NEXT QUESTION NICE 
VL-sollesne 95.86 98.21 s0001 IF YOU'RE A SCIENTIST RIGHTIST HOLIDAYS 
VL-sollesne 98.22 102.95 s0001 GRASS ORGANISED RIGHT SO WHAT KIND OF STRUCTURE SPECTRUMS DO I SEEN THESE GUYS RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 102.96 104.00 s0001 AND AH 
VL-sollesne 104.01 105.97 s0001 USUALLY WHEN WE PLOT NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 105.97 110.02 s0001 AT THIS IN OUR MIND WE HAVE TO JUST LIKE BE SIMPLY JUST LIKE THAT RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 110.03 113.12 s0001 REALLY WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DIVE INTO TWO DAYS 
VL-sollesne 113.13 120.08 s0001 HOW SHOULD THEY THINK ABOUT STRUCTURE OF THIS LARGE NETWORKS AND WHAT KIND OF SORT OF MENTAL IMAGES SHOULD I CARE FOR MYSELF SOMEWHAT IN THE BACK OF MY BRAIN 
VL-sollesne 120.08 121.28 s0001 RIGHT ON 
VL-sollesne 121.29 125.13 s0001 SO THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT I WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND 
VL-sollesne 125.14 129.02 s0001 THE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION OF THESE NETWORKS THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
VL-sollesne 129.03 131.75 s0001 IT'S CALLED THE LEVEL OF COMMUNITIES RIGHT SO REALLY 
VL-sollesne 131.76 134.73 s0001 THE WAY WE WE THINK OF NETWORKS IS THAT WE SAY THAT 
VL-sollesne 134.74 141.89 s0001 UM NODES IN THESE NETWORKS MAYBE HUMANS PEOPLE ARE ORGANISING TO THIS KIND OF TIGHTLY CONNECTED CLUSTERS RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE 
VL-sollesne 141.90 143.01 s0001 THIS IS A SET OF 
VL-sollesne 143.02 146.76 s0001 THIS IS A NETWORK WHERE EVERY NODE IS A SCIENTIST AND CONNECTION STARTED 
VL-sollesne 146.77 148.97 s0001 PEOPLE WHO WORKED OR PUBLISHED TOGETHER 
VL-sollesne 148.97 152.44 s0001 AND LIKE YOU SEE IN THIS NETWORK THE BETTER SORT OF THESE CLUMPS OF NODES 
VL-sollesne 152.44 153.54 s0001 THAT STAND TO WORK 
VL-sollesne 153.55 156.53 s0001 THE TEN TO WORK TOGETHER AND MAYBE THESE CLUMPS CORRESPOND 
VL-sollesne 156.54 159.23 s0001 ALTHOUGH RESEARCHERS SEEN A PARTICULAR SUB AREA 
VL-sollesne 159.25 160.91 s0001 OR MAYBE THESE ARE ALL THE RESEARCHER 
VL-sollesne 160.93 163.62 s0001 RESEARCHERS COMING FROM THE SAME UNIVERSITY AND SO ON 
VL-sollesne 163.63 165.54 s0001 AND ALSO IN LIKE SOCIAL NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 165.55 170.21 s0001 YOU EXPECT TO SEE THIS KIND OF COMMUNITY SORT CLIMB SORT OF GROUPS OF NODES RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 170.21 173.03 s0001 AND UM THERE ARE MANY OTHER CASES WHERE A DISK 
VL-sollesne 173.04 175.13 s0001 COMMUNITIES NATURALLY ARISE RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 175.14 179.94 s0001 ON THE WEB IF YOU THINK OF THE WEB WAS A GRAPH SO WEB PAGES AND HYPERLINKS 
VL-sollesne 179.95 183.55 s0001 COMMUNITY SCHOOL CORRESPONDS TO POPULATE THAT SETS OF PAGES 
VL-sollesne 183.56 186.04 s0001 OR FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU TAKE CITATION NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 186.05 187.09 s0001 THEN SORT OF 
VL-sollesne 187.10 195.20 s0001 IF YOU'D YOU WOULD DO COMMUNITY DETECTION IS CITATION NETWORKS THE COMMUNITIES WOULD PROBABLY CORRESPONDS TO SAVE DEFEAT SUB DISCIPLINE SORT PARTICULAR AREA US 
VL-sollesne 195.21 198.11 s0001 OR PARTICULAR PEAKS WHERE PEOPLE LIKE TO CITE EACH OTHER 
VL-sollesne 198.11 202.00 s0001 AH IN FOR EXAMPLE ON THE WEB THIS IS A VERY SORT OF A VERY 
VL-sollesne 202.01 203.64 s0001 IN SOME SENSE FAMOUS PICTURE SO 
VL-sollesne 203.66 205.52 s0001 EVERY NOTE HERE IS A BLOG 
VL-sollesne 205.53 206.78 s0001 AND UM 
VL-sollesne 206.79 211.70 s0001 THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE BLOG REPRESENTS EACH BLOG TEND TO STANCE TO CITE EACH OTHER BLOG 
VL-sollesne 211.70 218.55 s0001 AND ON IT AND THEN BLOT AFFORD A REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATS AND SORT OF WHAT YOU FIND HERE IS THAT YOU CAN BE SORT OF VERY NICELY 
VL-sollesne 218.55 225.77 s0001 YOU KNOW THE THE THE DEMOCRAT THE DEMOCRATIC PART OF THE BLOGOSPHERE AND ANYBODY CAN PART OF THE BLOGOSPHERE NET ALREADY FEW 
VL-sollesne 225.78 227.44 s0001 CONNECTIONS ACROSS RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 227.45 232.04 s0001 NOW WE HAVE ONE COMMUNITY AND THE OTHER COMMUNITY SO BASICALLY THE IDEA IS THAT THE NETWORK STRUCTURE 
VL-sollesne 232.05 233.76 s0001 OR THAT ANY T. V. OR SOMETHING 
VL-sollesne 233.76 240.64 s0001 ABOUT WHAT IS THE UNDERLYING SINGING THE NETWORK ON WHAT I HAVE HERE IS ANOTHER COLLABORATION AT WHAT THIS IS 
VL-sollesne 240.64 243.36 s0001 ALL THE PEOPLE FROM A SANTA FE INSTITUTE 
VL-sollesne 243.37 246.53 s0001 AND AGAIN YOU SORT OF SEE THESE TIGHTLY CONNECTED CLASS STATUS 
VL-sollesne 246.53 248.97 s0001 AND EACH CLUSTER CORRESPONDS TO A CENT 
VL-sollesne 248.98 250.17 s0001 IF YOU THEN GO AND SEE 
VL-sollesne 250.19 253.21 s0001 AND EXAMINE WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE CORRESPONDING TO THAT CLUSTER 
VL-sollesne 253.22 256.29 s0001 YOU SEE THAT THEY SORT OF WORK AND DIFFERENT TOPICAL AREAS 
VL-sollesne 256.29 259.48 s0001 UM MAYBE FROM COMPUTER SCIENCE POINT OF MOTIVATION 
VL-sollesne 259.49 262.17 s0001 HERE'S ANOTHER ANOTHER VIEW OF WHY 
VL-sollesne 262.17 264.64 s0001 WHY YOU MAY WANT TO BE INTERESTED IN COMMUNITIES 
VL-sollesne 264.64 266.52 s0001 SO WHAT I'M SHOWING YOU HERE IS A 
VL-sollesne 266.54 274.42 s0001 WHAT IS CALLED AN ADJACENT SEMANTICS RIGHT SO I HAVE NOTES HERE AND NODES THAT AND I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHATEVER THERE IS AN EDGE BETWEEN THESE SNOW THAN THAT NODE 
VL-sollesne 274.43 279.63 s0001 RIGHT AND AND WHAT I'VE DONE NOTING MY NETWORK NOW I CAN ADVERTISERS 
VL-sollesne 279.64 282.95 s0001 AND THESE ARE THE COMMUNITIES THEY BE DONE RIGHT SO BASICALLY IN WEB SEARCH 
VL-sollesne 282.95 284.14 s0001 YOU HAVE THE ADS 
VL-sollesne 284.16 288.75 s0001 AND UH PARTICULAR ADVERTISER CAN BE DONE UH PARTICULAR COMMUNITY SO THE IDEA IS THAT 
VL-sollesne 288.76 290.28 s0001 WHENEVER SOMEBODY SEARCHERS 
VL-sollesne 290.30 291.41 s0001 FOR THE LINE HERE 
VL-sollesne 291.42 295.30 s0001 ALL THESE GUYS WILL COMPETE TO HAVE THE ADS DISPLAYED NECK NEXT TO THAT 
VL-sollesne 295.31 298.52 s0001 RIGHT AND NOW THE IDEA IS IF YOU NOW GO IN SEARCH FOR 
VL-sollesne 298.52 300.29 s0001 PLASTICINE THIS KIND OF NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 300.31 302.69 s0001 THEN YOU WOULD FIND STRUCTURES LIKE THIS AND 
VL-sollesne 302.70 306.02 s0001 MAYBE WHAT YOU WOULD FIND IS THAT ALL THESE ADVERTISERS 
VL-sollesne 306.04 309.23 s0001 TENDS TO BE ON A COMMON SET OF CREATION IF YOU WOULD LOOK AT 
VL-sollesne 309.24 310.77 s0001 EXAMINE LIKE THIS BIZARRE 
VL-sollesne 310.77 313.45 s0001 IT'S DONE NOW THE POLICE COMMITTEE SET ABOUT GAMBLING 
VL-sollesne 313.45 314.51 s0001 AND YOU KNOW THIS 
VL-sollesne 314.52 317.74 s0001 SOME PART OF THEM OUT OF BOUTS OF SPORTS BETTING AND SO ON 
VL-sollesne 317.75 318.82 s0001 RIGHT SO AGAIN 
VL-sollesne 318.83 320.19 s0001 WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS 
VL-sollesne 320.19 323.00 s0001 WE COMMUNITIES A TOFFEE 
VL-sollesne 323.01 326.95 s0001 RIGHT SO SO NOW IF I WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS CLASS THE SEA NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 326.97 331.02 s0001 THE QUESTION IS HOW HOW DO I GO AND HOW DO I FIND THEM RIGHT SO THE WAY 
VL-sollesne 331.02 335.07 s0001 THE WAY WE MENTALLY PICTURE THIS KIND OF THE STRUCTURE OF NET WAS A CALF BLASTERS 
VL-sollesne 335.08 338.38 s0001 HERE I'M SHOWING YOU THREE EXAMPLES FROM THE LITERATURE RIGHT SO THERE'S THAT 
VL-sollesne 338.39 342.03 s0001 SORT OF THE THE VERSION ONE POINT ZERO RIGHT SO USING THAT YOU CAN'T 
VL-sollesne 342.04 344.07 s0001 YOU HAVE THE CITY CLUSTERS YOUR CAB 
VL-sollesne 344.08 348.22 s0001 YOU HAVE NO AGING THESE CLUSTERS THERE ARE LOTS OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF THE CLUSTER 
VL-sollesne 348.24 351.29 s0001 AND A FEW CONNECTIONS POINTING OUTSIDE THE CLUSTER RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 351.30 353.74 s0001 AND NOW IF YOU SORT OF GET A BIT FANCIER 
VL-sollesne 353.74 355.47 s0001 YOU YOU ARRIVE TO THIS PICTURE 
VL-sollesne 355.48 357.82 s0001 WELL NOW AGAIN I SORT OF HAVE THREE CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 357.83 358.96 s0001 BUT EACH OF THESE 
VL-sollesne 358.96 360.85 s0001 PHOEBE CLUSTER SORT OF CARE 
VL-sollesne 360.86 365.36 s0001 UM SOME SUB CLUSTERS RIGHT SO SORT OF LIKE HAVING A HIERARCHY OF CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 365.39 367.35 s0001 AND IF I EVEN GET FANCIER 
VL-sollesne 367.36 370.32 s0001 THEN I ARRIVE TO THE PICTURES LIKE THIS WHEN I SAY THAT NOW 
VL-sollesne 370.33 372.12 s0001 GLOUCESTER SKIN EVEN OVERLAP 
VL-sollesne 372.13 373.68 s0001 SO MAYBE HE SAID NODES 
VL-sollesne 373.69 379.46 s0001 I HAD A MAYBE IN A SOCIAL NETWORK THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT BELONG TO MOVE PEOPLE COMMUNITY SORT OF PEOPLE CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 379.46 380.94 s0001 RIGHT SO THIS IS 
VL-sollesne 380.94 382.08 s0001 ONE ONE 
VL-sollesne 382.09 385.31 s0001 IMAGE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR MIND WHEN THINKING ABOUT NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 385.31 388.59 s0001 AND THE OTHER TEENAGER I WANT TO CONTRAS BE SEEN THIS TALK 
VL-sollesne 388.60 392.42 s0001 IS THE FOLLOWING EACH ACTUALLY THAT IS OUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT LARGE NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 392.43 394.60 s0001 THEY LOOK LIKE THEY SORT OF THEY LOOK LIKE AN 
VL-sollesne 394.61 396.58 s0001 ONION OR ARE THEY CAN BE SO 
VL-sollesne 396.58 399.85 s0001 CALLED THEY CALL IT A COURT PRETTY THIRTY STRUCTURAL BECAUSE HE THOUGHT 
VL-sollesne 399.86 403.73 s0001 JELLYFISH STRUCTURE OR OUT OCTOPUS STRUCTURE RIGHT SO THESE ARE ALL 
VL-sollesne 403.74 408.91 s0001 A TECHNICAL TERMS DIRTY FOOT POOL STRUCTURES LIKE THIS RIGHT SORT OF THAT THAT SORT OF THAT YOU'RE 
VL-sollesne 408.92 410.47 s0001 NETWORK IS COMPOSED OF THIS 
VL-sollesne 410.48 413.20 s0001 CONCENTRIC CIRCLES NOT GET BANDS AND ANSWERED 
VL-sollesne 413.21 416.16 s0001 AND THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW PLASTICINE HERE RIGHT IT SORT OF JUSTICE 
VL-sollesne 416.17 418.80 s0001 MAN IS THAT THERE'S THERE'S THAT AND THEN TO THINK OF LIKE 
VL-sollesne 418.80 420.39 s0001 YOU'VE GOT AN ONION ACROSS 
VL-sollesne 420.40 421.52 s0001 RIGHT SO IN IT 
VL-sollesne 421.53 423.33 s0001 WHAT MY TALK OF 
VL-sollesne 423.34 425.02 s0001 TODAY WILL BE ABOUT WILL BE 
VL-sollesne 425.03 426.59 s0001 HOW DO YOU RECONCILE 
VL-sollesne 426.60 428.42 s0001 THIS PICTURE AND THAT PICTURE 
VL-sollesne 428.43 429.65 s0001 RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 429.66 433.83 s0001 IF MY NETWORKS LOOK LIKE THESE THEN THEY CANNOT LOOK LIKE THAT AND IF THEY LOOK LIKE THESE THEN THEY 
VL-sollesne 433.84 435.11 s0001 CANNOT LOOK LIKE THAT SO 
VL-sollesne 435.13 438.28 s0001 HOW CAN HOW SHOULD I THINK ABOUT CLUSTERS SO THAT 
VL-sollesne 438.33 441.33 s0001 THESE TWO PICTURES COME TOGETHER SO THIS IS REALLY 
VL-sollesne 441.34 444.36 s0001 UM WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS 
VL-sollesne 444.38 447.41 s0001 HOW DO YOU SORT OF PUT THESE TWO SEEMINGLY 
VL-sollesne 447.42 451.12 s0001 DIFFERENT LOOSE ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE NETWORKS OF TOGETHER 
VL-sollesne 451.13 454.46 s0001 OKAY AND UM WHAT THEY WANT TO DO FOR THE REST OF THE TALK IS 
VL-sollesne 454.46 458.79 s0001 I WANT TO FIRST FOCUS ON THIS SIDE OF THE PICTURE AND SHE AND SORT OF SHOW YOU 
VL-sollesne 458.81 459.86 s0001 HOW YOU ARRIVED 
VL-sollesne 459.86 463.23 s0001 TO THE CONCLUSION THAT LARGE NETWORKS HAVE THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE 
VL-sollesne 463.23 466.97 s0001 AND THEN I WANT TO MAKE A STEP BACK AND ACTUALLY START TALKING ABOUT COMMUNITIES 
VL-sollesne 466.98 467.75 s0001 AND BRING THE TWO 
VL-sollesne 467.75 468.26 s0040 FEATURES 
VL-sollesne 468.27 469.45 s0040 SO THAT'S 
VL-sollesne 469.46 470.66 s0040 THAT'S BASICALLY UM 
VL-sollesne 470.68 471.19 s0040 WHAT THAT ONE 
VL-sollesne 471.19 472.54 s0001 TO TALK ABOUT 
VL-sollesne 472.54 474.43 s0001 AH SO THE FIRST THING 
VL-sollesne 474.44 475.87 s0001 BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS 
VL-sollesne 475.88 477.20 s0001 HOW DO I HAVE TO USE 
VL-sollesne 477.20 479.53 s0001 THIS NOTION THAT NETWORKS HAVE THIS KIND OF 
VL-sollesne 479.53 483.21 s0001 OH COOL PRETTY THIRTY STRUCTURE READ SORT OF HAVE THESE DENSELY CONNECTED COURT 
VL-sollesne 483.22 485.37 s0001 AND IN THIS SPARSELY CONNECTED BRIEFLY 
VL-sollesne 485.38 488.01 s0001 AND THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THIS IS BASICALLY WOULD SAY OKAY 
VL-sollesne 488.01 491.88 s0001 HOW COULD I QUANTIFY HOW WELL DOES THE NETWORK ORGANISE INTO CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 491.88 496.34 s0001 AND THEN SORT OF A NEXT STEP WILL BE TO SAY OKAY WHAT KIND OF COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENT 
VL-sollesne 496.34 497.40 s0001 COULD I DESIGN 
VL-sollesne 497.41 501.17 s0001 THAT WOULD BE REALLY SOMETHING USEFUL ABOUT ORGANISATIONAL SNAP KICKS 
VL-sollesne 501.18 502.88 s0001 RIGHT AND THE IDEA WILL BE 
VL-sollesne 502.88 506.45 s0001 SO I CAME TO KIRIBATI BASICALLY WAS APPROXIMATION OF ITEMS 
VL-sollesne 506.46 507.60 s0001 TO DO 
VL-sollesne 507.62 511.19 s0001 INSTEAD OF ANTIQUE A GRAPH PETITIONING PROBLEMS 
VL-sollesne 511.20 516.33 s0001 SORT OF A SOME KIND OF EXPERIMENTAL PROBES IN THE UM STRUCTURE OF OUR NETWORKS SO 
VL-sollesne 516.34 517.81 s0001 I MADE THIS MORE PRECISE 
VL-sollesne 517.80 521.98 s0001 SO ANY THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THIS IS THE FOLLOWING DAY WE SAY IF HE SEES 
VL-sollesne 522.00 524.14 s0001 IF YOU THINK OF NETWORKS LIKE THESE 
VL-sollesne 524.14 531.39 s0001 THEN WOMEN SAY LET'S GO AND TRY TO IDENTIFY CLUSTER C. NETWORKS AND MAYBE NOT JUST TRYING TO IDENTIFY THEM BUT LET'S TRY TO MEASURE 
VL-sollesne 531.39 534.72 s0001 HOW WELL ARE DISCUSSED AS EXPRESSED IN NETWORKS RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 534.73 535.96 s0001 AND THEN WE WILL DESIGN 
VL-sollesne 535.97 540.99 s0001 I MEASURED THAT TELL ME HOW WELL ARE THE CLUSTERS EXPRESSED AND MAYBE LEARN SOMETHING FROM THAT MEASURE RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 540.99 545.20 s0001 AND I'M NOT IF I WANT TO GO ON A SEARCH FOR THIS CLASS THIS 
VL-sollesne 545.21 548.54 s0001 A WORKING DEFINITION OF DISCUSSED THIS IS BASICALLY THAT 
VL-sollesne 548.54 551.80 s0001 I WANT TO FIND SETS OF LAWS THAT HAVE LOTS OF CONNECTIONS 
VL-sollesne 551.82 558.13 s0001 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF THE SET AND A FEW CONNECTIONS POINTING GOATS OUTSIDE THE SET RIGHT SORT OF THIS KIND OF INTUITION 
VL-sollesne 558.13 561.89 s0001 AND THEN THE SET OF LAWS THAT HAVE THIS KIND OF PROPERTY 
VL-sollesne 561.90 562.95 s0001 I CALL THEM 
VL-sollesne 562.97 565.82 s0001 COMMUNITY SO I CALLED THEM CLUSTER SORT OF GROUPS OR 
VL-sollesne 565.83 567.85 s0001 MODULES SOLAR I GIVE THEM SOMETHING 
VL-sollesne 567.85 569.27 s0001 RIGHT SO IN IT 
VL-sollesne 569.28 572.18 s0001 ON THAT IS THAT HAS BEEN THE WHOLE SINKING TAKING THE STING OUT 
VL-sollesne 572.20 574.17 s0001 HOLLY AT LEAST THIS INTUITION 
VL-sollesne 574.17 576.02 s0001 AND HOW DO YOU SORT OF 
VL-sollesne 576.02 578.69 s0001 OF THOSE FOUR METERS INTO SOME KIND OF 
VL-sollesne 578.70 581.75 s0001 I'LL GAUDY THEM OR SOMETHING THAT AGAIN TO GO AND FIND 
VL-sollesne 581.76 584.45 s0001 THIS SETS OF NODES THAT HAVE THIS KIND OF PROBLEM 
VL-sollesne 584.45 585.58 s0001 RIGHT ON 
VL-sollesne 585.59 588.21 s0001 AND I WILL TOUCH ON A FEW OF THESE 
VL-sollesne 588.22 590.79 s0001 SO ON ANY MY QUESTION TO BE 
VL-sollesne 590.79 592.79 s0001 YOU KNOW IS THIS THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT 
VL-sollesne 592.80 594.80 s0001 OF THE STRUCTURE OF CATHOLICS 
VL-sollesne 595.83 599.77 s0001 OKAY SO HIDEOUS CANDIES THE CAN SORT OF THE 
VL-sollesne 599.78 603.92 s0001 IF YOU HAVE EVER SEEN A SINGLE SOCIAL NETWORK THEN YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THIS ONE RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 603.94 609.69 s0001 SO THIS IS THE THE UM THE IT'S CALLED ZACHARY SCOTT THE CLUB NETWORK SO THE IDEA WAS THAT 
VL-sollesne 609.70 612.42 s0001 THERE WAS A WAS A CRITIQUE WAS APPEARS USED TO THEM 
VL-sollesne 612.42 615.52 s0001 HE WAS STUDYING SOCIAL DICEY NARCOTIC LAB 
VL-sollesne 615.53 619.10 s0001 AND DURING THE HISTORY OF THIS CROWDED LOBBY THE UNIVERSITY THERE WAS A 
VL-sollesne 619.11 622.45 s0001 THERE WAS A CONFLICT AND THIS THE CLOCK SPLIT INTO TWO CLUBS 
VL-sollesne 622.46 625.06 s0001 AND THEN ONE CLUB FORMED AROUND THE 
VL-sollesne 625.07 630.12 s0001 THE UM THE THE THE THE THE INSTRUCTOR OF THE PREVIOUS CLUB 
VL-sollesne 630.13 634.78 s0001 AND ANOTHER PUB FORMED AROUND ONE OF ONE OF ITS MEMBERS WRITE AN AUTO SHOW YOU HERE IS 
VL-sollesne 634.78 641.65 s0001 A OR THE SQUARE IS FORMED THE SECOND CLUB AND ALL THE CIRCLE IN CIRCLES FORMED ANOTHER CLUB RIGHTS OR THE BEGINNING THIS WAS 
VL-sollesne 641.66 643.71 s0001 ONE GOT THE CLUB AND THEN THE PEOPLE SPEAK 
VL-sollesne 643.73 645.90 s0001 AND CIRCUS WENT TO FORM ONE 
VL-sollesne 645.91 652.48 s0001 AND THE SQUARES WENT TO FORM ANOTHER ONE AND NOW IF YOU SAY GIVEN JUST THE NETWORK STRUCTURE COULD I SORT OF RECONSTRUCT 
VL-sollesne 652.49 653.96 s0001 IN SOME SENSE PREDICT 
VL-sollesne 653.97 658.65 s0001 WHETHER PEOPLE WILL GO WITH THE CIRCUS OR WHETHER THEY'RE IN THIS UH DECIDED TO GO TO THE SQUARE CLUB 
VL-sollesne 658.66 659.91 s0001 THE THE WAY 
VL-sollesne 659.92 661.68 s0001 THE WAY TO FIND THESE DIVISION 
VL-sollesne 661.69 664.53 s0001 EASE BY BASICALLY TRYING TO SPLIT THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 664.53 666.69 s0001 INTO TWO EQUALLY SIZED HOPS 
VL-sollesne 666.70 670.44 s0001 SARGENT THEN IS THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF EDGES CROSSING THESE BOND RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 670.45 672.98 s0001 SO THIS IS BASICALLY ONE INTUITION WHY 
VL-sollesne 672.99 674.52 s0001 SEARCHING FOR 
VL-sollesne 674.53 679.13 s0001 SEXIST LOADS OF HAVE LOTS OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM AND LISTEN VERY FEW CONNECTIONS 
VL-sollesne 679.14 685.38 s0001 POINTING ACROSS WOULD FIND YOU SORT OF CLUSTERS THAT CORRESPONDS TO SOMETHING OR YIELD FROM YOUR LIFE 
VL-sollesne 685.39 692.09 s0001 RIGHT SO UH BEDS BASICALLY THE THE BASICALLY GRECIAN WHY SEARCHING FOR DESIGNATED SETS OF NODES MIGHT BE USEFUL 
VL-sollesne 692.09 696.09 s0001 SO NOW GOING BACK TO WHAT WE WANT TO DO RIGHT SO WE WOULD LIKE TO 
VL-sollesne 696.10 698.78 s0001 DESIGN A MEASURED OR SOMETHING THAT IS SAY HOW 
VL-sollesne 698.79 707.18 s0001 COMMUNITY LIKE IS A SET OF NODES RIGHT SO HOW WOULD OF A COMMUNITY IS A SET OF NOTES RIGHT SO NOW I WILL TAKE A SET OF NODES S. 
VL-sollesne 707.19 709.38 s0001 AND MY INTUITION HE STILL TO SAY HI 
VL-sollesne 709.39 714.51 s0001 GOOD COMMUNITIES HAVE MANY EDGES BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF THE SET THEM THROUGH I JUST POINTING OUTSIDE 
VL-sollesne 714.52 717.17 s0001 RIGHT SO NICELY DEAR EXAMPLES OF TWO SETS 
VL-sollesne 717.18 722.00 s0001 SO THAT I HAVE MY SET S. AND BELOW I AM I SENT THIS PRIME AND I ASK YOU 
VL-sollesne 722.01 726.02 s0001 WHICH IS THAT EACH OF THESE STORIES OF BETTER COMMUNITIES WHAT COMMUNITY LIKE 
VL-sollesne 726.02 727.17 s0001 I THINK IT WOULD ALL 
VL-sollesne 727.18 730.08 s0001 SORT OF DECIDE THAT THIS IS A BETTER COMMUNITY WHY 
VL-sollesne 730.10 733.70 s0001 BECAUSE IT HAS MORE EDGES BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATE HAS FEWER EDGES 
VL-sollesne 733.71 737.49 s0001 POINTING OUTSIDE THEN MY THEN MY DOING COMMUNITY OF THAT 
VL-sollesne 737.49 740.28 s0001 RIGHT SO ONE WAY TO FORMALISE THIS YOU GRECIAN 
VL-sollesne 740.29 743.45 s0001 INTO ON ON OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONAL IN SOME KIND OF FAR 
VL-sollesne 743.46 744.60 s0001 HERMETIC 
VL-sollesne 744.61 750.23 s0001 IS A IS THE NOTION THAT COMES FROM A THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE IT'S CALLED CONDUCTORS 
VL-sollesne 750.24 753.20 s0001 AND THEY ALL THE CONDUCTORS NAZIS THE FOLLOWING THE TEST 
VL-sollesne 753.21 754.93 s0001 HOW MANY I JUST POINT 
VL-sollesne 754.93 757.78 s0001 A OUTSIDE THE SEPARATE THESE ARE ALL THE EDGES WHERE 
VL-sollesne 757.79 761.31 s0001 ONE ENDPOINT EASY TO SET IN THE OTHER AND POINT IS OUTSIDE THE SET 
VL-sollesne 761.32 764.95 s0001 SO IN IN THIS CASE I HAVE TO I JUST POINTING OUTSIDE 
VL-sollesne 764.95 766.02 s0001 AND AH 
VL-sollesne 766.03 770.76 s0001 BELOW I JUST TAKE THE SOME OF THE DEGREES OF ALL THE NODES INSIDE THIS SO 
VL-sollesne 770.76 773.14 s0001 THE WAY YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THIS STUDY IS JUST TO SAY 
VL-sollesne 773.15 776.83 s0001 HOW MANY EDGES WAY HAVE INSIDE MY SET S. RIGHT AND I TAKE THIS A SHOCK 
VL-sollesne 776.84 779.78 s0001 THE SMALLER THE RATIO THE BETTER THE COMMUNITY RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 779.79 782.95 s0001 UM THE THE CONDUCTORS OFFSET THIS PRIME 
VL-sollesne 782.97 785.27 s0001 SMALLER THAN CONDUCT TINSEL SET S. 
VL-sollesne 785.28 788.65 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING WE WE WE NEED TO HAVE ITS 
VL-sollesne 788.66 789.99 s0001 BASICALLY THE SIMPLEST 
VL-sollesne 789.99 791.43 s0001 UM FORMALLY STATION 
VL-sollesne 791.44 795.32 s0001 ALL OF THIS INTUITION THAT I THAT I STARTED MEAT OF ALL ALONG 
VL-sollesne 795.32 797.62 s0001 OKAY SO NOW NOW I HAVE THE FIRST THING 
VL-sollesne 797.63 799.96 s0001 SO NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO SAY 
VL-sollesne 799.97 803.94 s0001 I WANT TO DEFINE A NEW QUANTITY THAT I WOULD CALL IT A NETWORK COMMUNITY PROFILE 
VL-sollesne 803.95 806.42 s0001 AND THE WAY I MEAN DEFINE THIS QUANTITIES THE FOLLOWING 
VL-sollesne 806.43 807.46 s0001 I WAS SAYING THAT 
VL-sollesne 807.48 812.57 s0001 AH I REALLY FIND THIS A PIECE OF PROFILE THAT TO BASICALLY TRY TO SAY 
VL-sollesne 812.58 815.14 s0001 FOR EVERY ACE CLUSTER SIZE HOW WELL AT IT 
VL-sollesne 815.15 820.86 s0001 CLUSTERS OF THAT PARTICULAR SIZE EXPRESSED HOW COMMUNITY LIFE I PROCESS OF A PARTICULAR SIZE 
VL-sollesne 820.87 823.45 s0001 SO THE WAY I WILL DO THIS IS THE FOLLOWING I WOULD SAY 
VL-sollesne 823.46 828.80 s0001 I WILL SAY THE FOLLOWING SO I HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS A SEARCH FUNCTION OF K. K.'S THE SIZE OF THE CLUSTER 
VL-sollesne 828.80 832.10 s0001 AND THEN I JUST SAY I WOULD GO OR WHAT ALL SUBSETS OF MY 
VL-sollesne 832.12 834.83 s0001 OF MY NETWORK THE SUBSETS ICE HAS TO BE 
VL-sollesne 834.84 840.40 s0001 EQUAL TO K. AND I WILL TAKE THE CLASS THIRD THAT HAS THE BEST QUALITY RIGHT SO FOR EVERY CLUSTER SIZE 
VL-sollesne 840.41 844.06 s0001 I WILL GO FIND THE BEST CLUSTER AND I REMEMBERED THAT OKAY 
VL-sollesne 844.07 846.68 s0001 AND THEN WHAT I DO IS I WOULD JUST CREATE A SPOT 
VL-sollesne 846.68 850.76 s0001 WELL HERE IS A THE LOG THE TEDIUM OF THE COST OF SIZE K. 
VL-sollesne 850.77 855.19 s0001 AND HERE IS THE CONDUCTORS OF THE BEST CLUSTER RIGHT SO I FIND THE BEST LAST SO 
VL-sollesne 855.20 856.37 s0001 THE WAY YOU CAN THINK OF 
VL-sollesne 856.38 860.58 s0001 ABOUT DOING THIS IS THE IDEA IS THE FOLLOWING RIGHT MAYBE I SIX CAKE WAS FIVE 
VL-sollesne 860.59 863.36 s0001 I'D GO SEARCH OR WHAT ALL POSSIBLE SUBSETS 
VL-sollesne 863.37 865.00 s0001 OF SCI SPIES 
VL-sollesne 865.01 871.22 s0001 I FIND THE BEST ONE ANY THAT GIVES ME A DOG RIGHT AND THEN I SAY OKAY WHAT THAT WHAT IS THE BEST LAST OF SIZE SALMON 
VL-sollesne 871.23 873.72 s0001 KATIE'S THESE GIVES ME A DOCTOR RIGHT AND 
VL-sollesne 873.73 875.66 s0001 I DO THIS WHAT EVERY POSSIBLE OKAY 
VL-sollesne 875.67 876.70 s0001 UM 
VL-sollesne 876.72 879.56 s0001 RIGHT THIS WOULD BE MAYBE THE BEST CLUSTER OF SCI STAND 
VL-sollesne 879.56 880.80 s0001 OKAY BUT HERE 
VL-sollesne 880.81 883.54 s0001 I DO THIS FOR ALL POSSIBLE CASE AND I GET 
VL-sollesne 883.55 884.62 s0001 I GET A LIFE 
VL-sollesne 884.63 886.55 s0001 OKAY SO REALLY 
VL-sollesne 886.56 891.02 s0001 AND THIS IS WHAT IT'D BE LOOKING GOT SO ALL THIS IS GOING INTO IT IS TO SAY 
VL-sollesne 891.03 894.28 s0001 I HAVE I HAVE CLASS THE SIZE HERE AND USED AS ME 
VL-sollesne 894.28 898.00 s0001 HOW WILL WHAT IS THE SCORE TO WHAT IS THE QUALITY OF BEST CLUSTER 
VL-sollesne 898.01 899.71 s0001 OF THAT PARTICULAR SIZE 
VL-sollesne 899.71 901.57 s0001 OKAY ON 
VL-sollesne 901.57 904.50 s0001 AND ANY SORT OF THE TECHNICAL QUESTION ABOUT 
VL-sollesne 904.51 906.88 s0001 HOW DO I COMPUTE THIS PROFILE PLOT 
VL-sollesne 906.89 907.93 s0001 THE PROBLEM IS 
VL-sollesne 907.94 911.85 s0001 THAT I CAN'T RESEARCHER WOULD ALL POSSIBLE SUBSETS RIGHT SO I'D 
VL-sollesne 911.86 915.78 s0001 I CANNOT DO THAT RIGHT IN THE REALLY THE WAY THE WAY I WE DO IN COMPUTER SCENE 
VL-sollesne 915.79 917.13 s0001 IN FACT THIS IS TO USE 
VL-sollesne 917.14 922.15 s0001 APPROXIMATION UH GOT IT COMES TO GET UP GRAPH PETITIONING SO BASICALLY USE COMMUNITY DETECTION METHODS AND 
VL-sollesne 922.15 924.40 s0001 UM COMPUTER SCIENCE HAS DEVELOPED 
VL-sollesne 924.40 925.81 s0001 A LOT OF UM 
VL-sollesne 925.82 933.79 s0001 A DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO FINDING PLUS THE SEA NETWORKS AND ALL THESE APPROACHES SORT OF GIVE YOU GIVE YOU SOME SENSE PROBABLY GOOD RESULTS 
VL-sollesne 933.80 935.51 s0001 BUT THEY ALSO HAVE UM 
VL-sollesne 935.52 939.75 s0001 SOME PROBLEMS SO WE NEED THE WAY WE REALLY DO NEED TO COMPUTE THIS IMPACT THIS 
VL-sollesne 939.75 941.06 s0001 IS THIS IS THAT 
VL-sollesne 941.07 943.29 s0001 WE WILL TAKE A PARTICULAR UM 
VL-sollesne 943.30 945.70 s0001 SORT OF TAKE A COMMUNITY DETECTION METHOD 
VL-sollesne 945.71 948.27 s0001 WE WILL FIND ALL THE CLUSTER SEEN THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 948.27 950.15 s0001 FOR EVERY CLASS TO BE TO REVIEW 
VL-sollesne 950.16 954.95 s0001 EVERY CUSTOM NOW HERE WILL BE A PARTICULAR BOUGHT SO MAYBE I TAKE IMAGINE THAT THEY TAKE MY 
VL-sollesne 954.96 957.98 s0001 BUT AT COMMUNITY ACTION MESS THAT I FIND ALL THE CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 957.99 959.37 s0001 EVERY CLUSTER OF 
VL-sollesne 959.38 964.06 s0001 HE REPRESENTS ABOUT THAT I'D THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE CLASS THAT THIS IS THE SCORE OF THAT CLUSTER 
VL-sollesne 964.06 967.27 s0001 AND ALL I DO THEN USE I FIND THE LOW WHAT ENVELOPE 
VL-sollesne 967.27 969.46 s0001 OFF OF OF THIS PLOT RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 969.47 973.93 s0001 I WOULD GO AND I WOULD CONNECT THE MILLIONS OF WHATEVER EVERY POSSIBLE K. 
VL-sollesne 973.94 975.71 s0001 AND THIS GIVES ME MY MIKE 
VL-sollesne 975.71 976.81 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-sollesne 976.82 979.47 s0001 THIS IS INTUITIVELY WHAT WE ARE COMPUTING SO 
VL-sollesne 979.48 981.15 s0001 WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU NOW IS 
VL-sollesne 981.16 983.68 s0001 WHAT CAN I LEARN FROM THE SHAPE OF THIS CURVE 
VL-sollesne 983.88 986.41 s0001 SO EVERYTHING GOOD SO FAR 
VL-sollesne 986.64 988.60 s0001 ANY ANY QUESTIONS 
VL-sollesne 992.04 996.98 s0001 OKAY SO WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE COMPUTING THEN HOW WE ARE COMPUTING 
VL-sollesne 996.98 998.18 s0001 SO NOW WHAT 
VL-sollesne 998.19 999.90 s0001 AS I SAID WHAT I WANT TO ASK IS 
VL-sollesne 999.91 1004.76 s0001 HOW DOES THE SHAPE THESE BLUE BLUE LINE WHAT DOES IT TELL ME ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF MY NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 1004.77 1008.57 s0001 SO UM FIRST I SHOW YOU A FEW EXAMPLES TO BUILD SOME INTUITION SO 
VL-sollesne 1008.58 1010.15 s0001 IMAGINE THAT I'M TAKING 
VL-sollesne 1010.16 1012.88 s0001 UM LET ME SEE SO BASICALLY LIKE A 
VL-sollesne 1012.89 1018.78 s0001 A GOOD DEEDS ORDER CUBES WATERLOO CHAINS RIGHT SO IMAGINE THAT I TAKE A GRAB THAT IS A GOOD 
VL-sollesne 1018.79 1021.48 s0001 AND UM IF I IF I COMPUTE 
VL-sollesne 1021.48 1023.79 s0001 UM IF I TAKE THESE BIG GRASS AND I ASK 
VL-sollesne 1023.80 1024.86 s0001 WHAT IS A NICE 
VL-sollesne 1024.86 1028.32 s0001 TRY TO FIND CLUSTERS SEEN THESE GRAPH RIGHT BACK TO GOD THESE GRAPHS 
VL-sollesne 1028.33 1031.35 s0001 I CAN ASK WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE CLUSTER 
VL-sollesne 1031.36 1033.59 s0001 WHAT IS CIS OF CONDUCT INSANITY 
VL-sollesne 1033.60 1038.54 s0001 CONDUCTORS IS MEASURING NOTHING AS A SORT OF SURFACE TO VOLUME RATIO RIGHT SO IF I'M 
VL-sollesne 1038.55 1041.04 s0001 PLOTTING THIS ON A LOGARITHMIC SCALES 
VL-sollesne 1041.05 1043.08 s0001 THEN FOR EXAMPLE FOR A CHAIN 
VL-sollesne 1043.08 1047.78 s0001 I GET I GET US THIS LINE TO BE DOWNWARD SLOPING READ A SLOPE ONE 
VL-sollesne 1047.78 1051.11 s0001 BECAUSE BASICALLY IF I HAVE A LONG CHAIN I ALWAYS NEED TO CUT ONE EDGE 
VL-sollesne 1051.13 1055.55 s0001 TO GET A CLUSTER OF HOW MANY HOW MANY NODES WHATEVER SIZE I WANT BRIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 1055.56 1057.75 s0001 SO MY CONDUCT AND SHE'S ALWAYS ONE ALL WOULD 
VL-sollesne 1057.76 1061.91 s0001 THE NUMBER OF NOTES TIMES TO INSIDE THE CLUSTER RIGHT SO THIS WILL GO DOWN 
VL-sollesne 1061.91 1063.13 s0001 IN THE GREEN RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1063.14 1065.41 s0001 IF I WANT TO CUT THE CLUSTERING AGREED 
VL-sollesne 1065.42 1066.88 s0001 I NEED TO CUT SORT OF 
VL-sollesne 1066.89 1068.79 s0001 THE PERIMETER OF THE GREED 
VL-sollesne 1068.80 1070.21 s0001 AND I GET SQUARE 
VL-sollesne 1070.22 1072.83 s0001 THE NUMBER OF NODES INSIDE RIGHT SO THIS IS WHY 
VL-sollesne 1072.84 1074.50 s0001 THIS HAS A SLOPE OF ONE HOP 
VL-sollesne 1074.51 1077.46 s0001 RIGHT AND IF I TAKE A VERY BANDS AND ON GRAPH 
VL-sollesne 1077.47 1080.11 s0001 THEN THEN THE SLOPE OF THIS PLOT TO DEFLECT 
VL-sollesne 1080.10 1081.27 s0001 RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 1081.28 1085.68 s0001 UM THIS IS ONE ONE INTUITION SO THE INTUITION CAN IS BASICALLY FIGHTING SOME GRAPH 
VL-sollesne 1085.69 1087.54 s0001 AND I COMPUTE MY MAGIC BLOCK 
VL-sollesne 1087.55 1091.86 s0001 THEN DEPENDING IN SOME SENSE ON THE DIMENSIONALITY OF THAT OBJECT THAT I'M CUTTING 
VL-sollesne 1091.88 1094.06 s0001 I WILL HAVE THE DOWNWARD SLOPING LINE 
VL-sollesne 1094.07 1095.18 s0001 WITH A DIFFERENT SLOPE 
VL-sollesne 1095.20 1097.55 s0001 RIGHT SO WE FIND FOR EXAMPLE TAKING A CUBE 
VL-sollesne 1097.56 1101.01 s0001 LIKE A GOOD OFTEN CUTTING THAT I GET US LOCALS ONCE IT 
VL-sollesne 1101.01 1102.94 s0001 AND FOR EXAMPLE IF I TAKE 
VL-sollesne 1102.94 1107.12 s0001 AUDIO NETWORK FOR EXAMPLE I TAKE A NETWORK BEFORE THE CALIFORNIAN ROADS 
VL-sollesne 1107.13 1108.56 s0001 AND I COMPUTE MY PLOT 
VL-sollesne 1108.56 1111.47 s0001 I WILL GET A DOWNWARD SLOPING PLOT 
VL-sollesne 1111.48 1113.97 s0001 WHETHER THE SLOPE IS AROUND ONE HOP RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1113.98 1115.29 s0001 WHICH BASICALLY SAYS THAT 
VL-sollesne 1115.30 1116.54 s0001 WORLD NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 1116.55 1119.56 s0001 I LIKE A GOOD IT'S FRIDAY LOOK LIKE THESE BLUE LINE HERE 
VL-sollesne 1119.56 1122.51 s0001 RIGHT SO THAT'S THE FIRST PIECE OF INVENTION 
VL-sollesne 1122.51 1128.31 s0001 UM THE SECOND PIECE OF INFORMATION IS THAT ACTUALLY FIGHT GO THINK SOMEBODY OH WHAT OF NETWORKS FOR EXAMPLE 
VL-sollesne 1128.32 1130.88 s0001 HE'S HE'S THE NETWORK THAT I SHOWED YOU THIS IS THE 
VL-sollesne 1130.90 1134.04 s0001 THE PEOPLE THAT WORK OF THE RESEARCH ON NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1134.05 1135.23 s0001 IF I COMPUTE MY 
VL-sollesne 1135.24 1138.97 s0001 MY MY COMMUNITY SAID I COMPUTE MY MY COMMUNITY PROFILE 
VL-sollesne 1138.98 1140.48 s0001 KIDDIES THE SIZE OF THE 
VL-sollesne 1140.49 1142.69 s0001 OF THE COMMUNITY BUSES THE SCORE 
VL-sollesne 1142.70 1145.03 s0001 YOU AGAIN SEE THAT IT'S DOWNWARD SLOPING 
VL-sollesne 1145.04 1147.94 s0001 AND YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THIS PARTICULAR DEEP HERE 
VL-sollesne 1147.95 1152.44 s0001 CORRESPONDS TO THE COMMUNITY THAT I LABELLED READ A RIGHT SO DISGUSTED 
VL-sollesne 1152.45 1154.24 s0001 CORRESPONDS TO THESE DEEP HERE 
VL-sollesne 1154.25 1157.85 s0001 THE CLASS TO BE CORRESPONDS HERE IF I COMBINED SEE ANY TOGETHER 
VL-sollesne 1157.85 1160.47 s0001 I GET A I GET THAT POINT HERE SO 
VL-sollesne 1160.49 1165.04 s0001 BUT WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS AGAIN I SEE THE STINK OF SOPHIE DOWNWARDS 
VL-sollesne 1165.14 1166.74 s0001 AND SO REALLY 
VL-sollesne 1166.74 1173.32 s0001 WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR IF I SORT OF SUMMARISE AND MAKE A HYPOTHESIS RIGHT SO WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR 
VL-sollesne 1173.32 1175.37 s0001 FOR THE TWO EXAMPLES THAT THEY DID THERE IS THAT 
VL-sollesne 1175.39 1180.68 s0001 BASICALLY THIS THIS NETWORK AND REALLY PROFILE THAT I SHOWED YOU SORT OF SLOPES DOWNWARDS RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1180.69 1182.10 s0001 SORT OF HAS THIS KIND OF 
VL-sollesne 1182.10 1183.52 s0001 DOWN WHAT SHAPE 
VL-sollesne 1183.52 1186.62 s0001 AND A BASE IN THIS EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE YOU 
VL-sollesne 1186.64 1189.79 s0001 A FROM A CHAIN SINGLE LEADS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
VL-sollesne 1189.79 1193.45 s0001 THE THIS BILL OR THIS THE SPEED AT WHICH THIS IS SORT OF DESCENDING 
VL-sollesne 1193.45 1197.18 s0001 WHICH TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT THE THE ORIGINALITY OF MY NETWORK RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1197.18 1199.34 s0001 YOU KNOW THAT IN A SOFT SENSE 
VL-sollesne 1199.34 1201.96 s0001 SO IN THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS IF I 
VL-sollesne 1201.98 1203.49 s0001 IT'S SORT OF IF I THINK 
VL-sollesne 1203.50 1210.76 s0001 MY NETWORKS AND A MIGHT I TAKE REAL NETWORKS THAT ALLOWED RIGHT SO THE EXAMPLE I SHOWED YOU BEFORE HAD LIKE TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED NODES 
VL-sollesne 1210.77 1213.47 s0001 WHAT HAPPENS IF I TAKE GRABS THAT HAVE BIGGER SIZE 
VL-sollesne 1213.47 1215.44 s0001 SO WHAT WE DID IS WE TOOK 
VL-sollesne 1215.44 1221.90 s0001 BASICALLY LIVE TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT LARGE NETWORKS WITH A LARGE MEANS EVERYTHING THIS HAS MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND NODES 
VL-sollesne 1221.91 1225.19 s0001 AND I THINK THE LARGEST WE TOO COULD LIKE TEN MILLION THAT'S RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1225.20 1228.81 s0001 AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE SHAPE OF THIS PLOT LOOK THERE 
VL-sollesne 1228.81 1234.00 s0001 AND HE'S A HE'S A SORT OF SMALL EXAMPLE THAT WE WERE STILL ABLE TO DO SO 
VL-sollesne 1234.01 1235.70 s0001 AND THIS IS THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1235.71 1243.05 s0001 VISUALIZATION OF THE NETWORK AND THIS IS THE APPLAUD THAT I DEFINE BEFORE RIGHT SO PLASTICIZER VERSUS QUALITY LOWER IS BETTER 
VL-sollesne 1243.06 1247.63 s0001 OF WAS A SURPRISE THE SURPRISE IS THAT THESE GOES DOWN AND THEN GOES UP 
VL-sollesne 1247.82 1251.58 s0001 AH AND THE OTHER THING THAT SORT OF A 
VL-sollesne 1251.59 1256.15 s0001 OH CORRESPONDS TO TO GO TO THE PICTURE THAT IS THIS IS NOW THE VISUALIZATION 
VL-sollesne 1256.17 1257.21 s0001 I THINK WE DID IT 
VL-sollesne 1257.22 1258.66 s0001 AH YES YOU BUY IT 
VL-sollesne 1258.67 1262.39 s0001 AH OF THAT NETWORK AND WHAT YOU SEE RIGHT IS THAT SORT OF THERE IS NO 
VL-sollesne 1262.40 1266.96 s0001 NO LITTLE GOT NO GOOD CLASS THAT'S ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE ON YOUR COMMUNITY DETECTION METHOD 
VL-sollesne 1266.97 1268.12 s0001 AND THEN BLOCKED 
VL-sollesne 1268.11 1273.65 s0001 THE CLUSTERS FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMUNITY ADDICTION METHOD WILL TELL YOU THAT WITH HIS REMOTE CORNERS ALONG ALONG CLUSTER 
VL-sollesne 1273.67 1276.33 s0001 AND ALL THAT AND NOTES OF THEM BELONG TO ANOTHER CLUSTER 
VL-sollesne 1276.33 1279.26 s0001 AND ALL THESE GREEN OLD SCORES BELONG TO SOME OTHER 
VL-sollesne 1279.27 1281.41 s0001 GREEN CLUSTER THAT I THAT I'VE LABELED THERE 
VL-sollesne 1281.42 1282.88 s0001 RIGHT SO SORT OF 
VL-sollesne 1282.89 1287.20 s0001 SOMETHING SOMETHING FUNNY IS GOING ON RIGHT IN THIS NETWORK IS NOT THAT BIG BECAUSE ONLY 
VL-sollesne 1287.21 1290.47 s0001 FOUR THOUSAND NODES IN TEN THOUSAND EDGES FIFTEEN THOUSAND PAGES 
VL-sollesne 1290.48 1292.48 s0001 RIGHT SO EASY TO SHOW YOU THAT 
VL-sollesne 1292.49 1294.57 s0001 THIS KIND OF DOWN AND UP SHAPE 
VL-sollesne 1294.57 1298.93 s0001 EASE OF USE COMMON HERE AND DIFFERENT EXAMPLES SO RIGHT SO THIS IS THE 
VL-sollesne 1298.95 1302.38 s0001 LIVE JOURNAL NETWORK A SOCIAL NETWORKING SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE 
VL-sollesne 1302.39 1305.57 s0001 THESE ARE ALL THE GERMANS THAT THEY'RE USING MICROSOFT INSTANT MESSENGER 
VL-sollesne 1305.58 1307.28 s0001 AGAIN COUPLE OF MILLION PEOPLE 
VL-sollesne 1307.29 1311.03 s0001 THIS IS THE BYPASS PIPE NETWORK OF OR SERVICE TO PAPERS 
VL-sollesne 1311.04 1315.68 s0001 UH SO SCIENTIFIC PAPERS A DISEASE CITATION NETWORK FROM HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS 
VL-sollesne 1315.69 1317.04 s0001 PART OF THE WEB GRAPH 
VL-sollesne 1317.05 1323.45 s0001 AND THIS IS THE AMAZON OF PRODUCTS CO PURCHASING NETWORK SO EVERY NOTE IS A IS A A PRODUCT 
VL-sollesne 1323.46 1327.02 s0001 AND YOU CONNECT NODES OF DEATH GO PUT JUST TOGETHER OKAY 
VL-sollesne 1327.20 1330.67 s0001 UH THE BLACK LINE A GOOD QUESTION SO THE BLACK LINE 
VL-sollesne 1330.68 1332.59 s0001 EASE THE COMMUNITY PROFILE 
VL-sollesne 1332.60 1336.27 s0001 OF THE RANDOM GRAPH CONDITIONS ON THE SAME DEGREE DISTRIBUTION 
VL-sollesne 1336.28 1344.86 s0001 RIGHT SO A DECENT BLACK LINE TELLS ME WHAT IF I WOULD BEG THE GROUND BECAUSE THE SAME NUMBER OF NOTES THE SAME NUMBER OF FAIR JUST AND EVERY EDGE HAS THE SAME NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS 
VL-sollesne 1344.86 1346.85 s0001 BUT THESE CONNECTIONS GO AND THEM 
VL-sollesne 1346.85 1348.15 s0001 AND YOU SEE 
VL-sollesne 1348.16 1352.89 s0001 BUT BASICALLY I LOSE ALL THE STRUCTURE I SEE NO CLASS THIS WHATSOEVER 
VL-sollesne 1353.72 1357.99 s0001 SO IT'S IT'S LIKE COMPARING TO THE BASELINE BUT FOR NOW IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
VL-sollesne 1357.99 1359.17 s0001 IT SAYS THAT 
VL-sollesne 1359.17 1361.07 s0001 NETWORKS ARE NOT AND BECAUSE 
VL-sollesne 1361.08 1362.62 s0001 THESE NETWORKS WOULD BE RANDOM 
VL-sollesne 1362.62 1365.07 s0001 I WOULD BE OF THEM BUT I'M DOWN HERE SO I HAVE 
VL-sollesne 1365.08 1370.14 s0001 MORE STRUCTURE I HAVE BETTER START BIT MORE STRUCTURE OR MORE CLUSTERS THAN WHAT I WOULD EXPECT 
VL-sollesne 1370.15 1372.85 s0001 THE WORLD WOULD BE SORT OF THEM 
VL-sollesne 1373.85 1377.66 s0001 BUT SORT OF IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER FOR WHAT I WANT TO PAY 
VL-sollesne 1377.68 1378.89 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-sollesne 1378.90 1380.12 s0001 UH GOING BACK SO 
VL-sollesne 1380.13 1381.35 s0001 JUST TO SHOW YOU 
VL-sollesne 1381.36 1384.87 s0001 OF MY LIVE JOURNAL EXAMPLE RIGHT THE THING GOES DOWN AND GOES UP 
VL-sollesne 1384.88 1388.63 s0001 SO THE QUESTION BASICALLY CALL SHOULD I UNDERSTAND HE'S RIGHT WHAT THE WAY I SHOULD 
VL-sollesne 1388.64 1390.26 s0001 EARLY THIS IS TO SAY THAT 
VL-sollesne 1390.27 1395.25 s0001 US US CLASSED AS GO BETWEEN YOU KNOW FROM SMALL SIZE TO LET'S AROUND A HUNDRED 
VL-sollesne 1395.26 1396.68 s0001 THEY GET BETTER AND BETTER 
VL-sollesne 1396.69 1398.75 s0001 RIGHT SO THE THE SAYING GOES DOWN 
VL-sollesne 1398.76 1400.38 s0001 BUT THEN AT SOME SIZE RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1400.38 1406.22 s0001 AND MY CLASS THIS STARTED GETTING WORSE AND WORSE RIGHT SORT OF IF I WANT THE CLUSTER ON THOUSAND MILES 
VL-sollesne 1406.23 1410.07 s0001 IT'S ACTUALLY HAS VERY BAD QUALITY HAS WAS QUALITY THAN SOMETHING 
VL-sollesne 1410.08 1411.99 s0001 OF A SMALL SIZE 
VL-sollesne 1412.00 1416.16 s0001 SO REALLY NOW THE QUESTION IS WHY DOES THIS TELL ME ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 1416.17 1417.44 s0001 AND THE FIRST THING IS 
VL-sollesne 1417.45 1419.96 s0001 WHAT KIND OF THE QUESTION IS HOW DO I 
VL-sollesne 1419.97 1425.24 s0001 WHAT HOW DO I EXPLAIN THE UPWARD GOING BODY AND THE WAY TO EXTEND UPWARD GROWTH GOING PART 
VL-sollesne 1425.25 1429.36 s0001 IS TO THINK OF NETWORKS AS A HEAVY HERE SO HERE I HAVE A BIG THREE 
VL-sollesne 1429.37 1433.15 s0001 AND THESE THREE LIKE CONTINUES DOWN TO A YOU KNOW TO THE GROUND AND SO ON 
VL-sollesne 1433.15 1435.27 s0001 AND THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS TO SAY 
VL-sollesne 1435.27 1438.22 s0001 AH THAT SORT OF IF YOU CAVITY WHERE EVERY NODE 
VL-sollesne 1438.23 1439.27 s0001 BECAUSE UM 
VL-sollesne 1439.28 1441.95 s0001 LET IT TWICE AS MANY CHILDREN AS IT 
VL-sollesne 1441.96 1444.42 s0001 OZZIE OZZIE IT'S THAT BAD AND DOES 
VL-sollesne 1444.43 1447.07 s0001 THEN YOU GET YOU WILL GET THE UPWARD SLOPING 
VL-sollesne 1447.08 1448.93 s0001 COMMUNITY PROFILE WHY IS THAT 
VL-sollesne 1448.95 1452.47 s0001 BECAUSE FIRST YOU WILL SAY OKAY THIS IS THE BEST COMMUNITY I CAN GET RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1452.48 1453.72 s0001 I GOT ONE EDGE 
VL-sollesne 1453.72 1456.65 s0001 AND I GET SEVEN OH SO WE FLY SOME OF THE DEGREES 
VL-sollesne 1456.66 1459.32 s0001 I GET A SEVEN EDGES INSIDE SO 
VL-sollesne 1459.33 1462.81 s0001 AH YOU KNOW HERE'S MY CONDUCT THAT'S NOW I WANT THE BIGGER CLUSTER SO 
VL-sollesne 1462.82 1466.77 s0001 THE WAY I GET A BIGGER CLUSTER IS TO CUT HERE RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO CUT WAY I JUST 
VL-sollesne 1466.78 1468.80 s0001 TO GET ONE ADDITIONAL EDGE INSIDE 
VL-sollesne 1468.81 1472.97 s0001 RIGHT SO AGAIN I'M GETTING WORSE NOT IF I WANT TO MAKE EVEN A BIGGER CLUSTER 
VL-sollesne 1472.97 1476.36 s0001 RIGHT I WOULD HAVE TO CUT EVEN MORE THAN JUST TO GET 
VL-sollesne 1476.36 1481.63 s0001 BASICALLY TO GET THIS TO THESE TWO EDGES OF ABOVE THINGS INSIDE MY CLUSTER RIGHT SO BASICALLY 
VL-sollesne 1481.64 1483.09 s0001 THE BIGGER CLASS THAT I WANT 
VL-sollesne 1483.10 1486.18 s0001 THE WATER SEED GETS RIGHT SO THIS IS SORT OF A PIE EXAMPLE 
VL-sollesne 1486.20 1489.46 s0001 THAT SAYS THAT AS I'M TRYING TO GET BIGGER CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 1489.47 1494.39 s0001 BASICALLY MORE AND MORE EDGES I HAVE TO CUT SO MY CLASS THIS BASICALLY GET WORSE AND WORSE 
VL-sollesne 1494.40 1496.69 s0001 UM SO THAT'S THE FIRST PART 
VL-sollesne 1496.69 1500.97 s0001 THE SECOND PART IS HOW DO I EXPLAIN THESE DOWNWARD BY THE GREEN PART 
VL-sollesne 1500.97 1502.81 s0001 AND IT AND BASICALLY HEARING 
VL-sollesne 1502.82 1504.35 s0001 IT EMPIRICALLY RESULT 
VL-sollesne 1504.36 1506.19 s0001 BUT BASICALLY YOU HAVE LOTS OF THESE 
VL-sollesne 1506.21 1507.29 s0001 VERY LITTLE 
VL-sollesne 1507.30 1508.80 s0001 A THESIS 
VL-sollesne 1508.80 1513.31 s0001 BUT THAT ARE THAT ARE CONNECTED TO JUST A FEW EDGES TO THE REST OF THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1513.32 1514.50 s0001 RIGHT UM 
VL-sollesne 1514.51 1517.72 s0001 AND BASICALLY THIS OR ANYTHING AS YOU THAT YOUR NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 1517.73 1520.45 s0001 HAVE SOME KIND OF COURTLY THIRTY STRUCTURE RIGHT I HAVE THIS 
VL-sollesne 1520.46 1523.86 s0001 LITTLE CLUSTERS ON THE PERIPHERY THE DECKS TO AROUND ONE HUNDRED 
VL-sollesne 1523.87 1525.16 s0001 NODES LARGE 
VL-sollesne 1525.17 1529.09 s0001 BUT I CAN EASILY CUT AWAY AND THEY GET SORT OF BETTER EMBEDDED AS I 
VL-sollesne 1529.10 1534.00 s0001 AS I CAN USE THE SIZE BUT ONE SORT OF I GET BEYOND THESE CRITICAL CLUSTER SIZE 
VL-sollesne 1534.01 1536.78 s0001 I HAVE TO GO START CUTTING INTO THESE THEN SCORE 
VL-sollesne 1536.79 1538.86 s0001 AND MY CLUSTERS GET WORSE AND WORSE 
VL-sollesne 1538.87 1542.54 s0001 RIGHT SO THIS IS THIS IS THE FIRST SORT OF THE FIRST CONCLUSION 
VL-sollesne 1542.55 1547.55 s0001 A BIT OF THE QUALITIES NEEDED PIECES WE CALL THEM THIS CARES OKAY 
VL-sollesne 1547.56 1550.75 s0001 SO WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE I CAN DO THE FOLLOWING 
VL-sollesne 1550.75 1552.33 s0001 I CAN TAKE MY NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1552.33 1554.35 s0001 IDENTIFY MY WHISKERS 
VL-sollesne 1554.35 1557.09 s0001 AND THEN YOU REMOVE THEM SO I CAN SAY WHAT IS THE 
VL-sollesne 1557.09 1559.99 s0001 WHAT IS THE COMMUNITY PROFILE OF THE FOOD NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1560.00 1563.50 s0001 VERSUS WAS A COMMUNITY PROFILE OF THE CORE OF THE NETWORK ONLY 
VL-sollesne 1563.50 1565.01 s0001 AND WHAT I'M SHOWING YOU HERE 
VL-sollesne 1565.02 1566.74 s0001 IS THE GREEN IS THE 
VL-sollesne 1566.75 1569.36 s0001 IS OF THE COMMITTEE PROFILE OF ONLY THE QUARTER 
VL-sollesne 1569.37 1571.77 s0001 AND READ THESE OF THE FOOD NETWORK ON 
VL-sollesne 1571.78 1573.14 s0001 SO WHAT DO YOU SEE 
VL-sollesne 1573.15 1576.36 s0001 BASICALLY YOU SEE THAT VERY LITTLE HAPPENS RIGHT MY RECORD OF 
VL-sollesne 1576.37 1578.05 s0001 JUST SHE'S THAT UPWARDS 
VL-sollesne 1578.06 1581.71 s0001 AND UM UM TO THE RIGHT OF SO BASICALLY THIS MEANS THAT 
VL-sollesne 1581.72 1583.53 s0001 BUT EVEN WHATEVER IS LEFT 
VL-sollesne 1583.53 1585.47 s0001 BECAUSE VERY SIMILAR STRUCTURE 
VL-sollesne 1585.48 1592.09 s0001 TO THE TO DO REGIONAL NETWORK RIGHT SO REALLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT MY CLASS THAT HAS GOT A BIT WORSE EVEN THOUGH 
VL-sollesne 1592.09 1595.38 s0001 I REMOVED ALL THE GREEN PARTS OUT OF THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1595.39 1599.22 s0001 SO ANY ONE USED AS IS NOW THAT I HAVE A COURT BRIEFLY STRUCTURE 
VL-sollesne 1599.23 1603.02 s0001 AND THESE CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE IS ACTUALLY MASTERED THE RIGHT SO THAT THE SCORE 
VL-sollesne 1603.03 1606.86 s0001 ALSO HAS A BAR LAYOUT OF PRETTY PRETTY AND ANOTHER LAYER OF COURT 
VL-sollesne 1606.86 1612.17 s0001 OKAY SO THAT'S WHAT I CAN CONCLUDE FROM AICHA WHAT I CAN CONCLUDE ALL OF THESE 
VL-sollesne 1612.18 1617.15 s0001 SO JUST TO SUMMARISE WHAT WHAT WHAT DO THESE EXPERIMENTS SUGGESTS 
VL-sollesne 1617.16 1619.52 s0001 SO THIS EXPERIENCE OF JAZZ THAT'S WHEN I'D 
VL-sollesne 1619.52 1622.49 s0001 LOOK AT NET WAS A CALF COUPLE OF THOUSANDS OF NODES 
VL-sollesne 1622.50 1627.31 s0001 THE WAY I I SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE SOMETHING IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS RIGHT SORT OF I HAVE THIS 
VL-sollesne 1627.32 1632.46 s0001 CAN CONCENTRIC CIRCLES THAT ALL SMELLS OF GOOD THEN AS MORE AND MORE DENSELY CONNECTED 
VL-sollesne 1632.46 1634.00 s0001 AND THEN IF I WANT TO GET 
VL-sollesne 1634.01 1638.48 s0001 GOOD CLUSTERS WHAT I DO IS BASICALLY I CUT AWAY DISTINCTLY SCRIPPS RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 1638.48 1642.62 s0001 YOU KNOW THAT THIS LITTLE PIECES THAT ARE VERY EASY TO CUT AWAY AND THESE ARE 
VL-sollesne 1642.63 1644.73 s0001 THESE ARE GOOD SMALL CLUSTERS BUT THEN 
VL-sollesne 1644.74 1647.50 s0001 WHEN I WANT TO START TO FIND THE CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 1647.51 1650.41 s0001 I HAVE TO START CUTTING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE 
VL-sollesne 1650.42 1651.74 s0001 COURT OFF MY NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1651.75 1654.03 s0001 AND THESE CLUSTERS GET WORSE AND WORSE 
VL-sollesne 1654.04 1655.10 s0001 AND JUST ON 
VL-sollesne 1655.11 1657.06 s0001 EMPIRICALLY IT TURNS OUT THAT 
VL-sollesne 1657.06 1661.30 s0001 AH AH SIXTY PERCENT OF THE NODES AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE EDGES 
VL-sollesne 1661.31 1663.72 s0001 UM SORT OF FIGHTING THE CORE OF THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1663.73 1667.09 s0001 AND THE REST EASY THAT THESE OF FIRST LAYER OF THE BRIEFLY 
VL-sollesne 1667.09 1669.07 s0001 AND THIS ALSO SORT OF EXPLAINS 
VL-sollesne 1669.08 1671.52 s0001 MANY EXPERIMENTS WITH PEOPLE TAKE A LARGE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1671.53 1672.69 s0001 DO THE CLUSTERING 
VL-sollesne 1672.70 1674.73 s0001 AND THEN THEY FIND ONE BIG CLUSTER 
VL-sollesne 1674.74 1678.95 s0001 BUT THESE ABOUT COUGH OF THE SIZE OF THE NETWORK AND THEY CALL DISGUSTED MISCELLANEOUS 
VL-sollesne 1678.96 1683.57 s0001 AND THEN THEY FIND ALL THE OTHER SMALL AND THEN THE THAT BUT FOR THE SMALL CLUSTERS RIGHT SO BASICALLY 
VL-sollesne 1683.58 1684.79 s0001 THEY FIND THE CORE 
VL-sollesne 1684.80 1687.97 s0001 AND THEN THEY FIND ALL THE LITTLE SMALL PIECES OKAY 
VL-sollesne 1687.97 1690.52 s0001 SO THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SAY 
VL-sollesne 1690.53 1696.67 s0001 ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE NETWORKS AND SORT OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITY SCHOOL USE THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE OF DIFFERENT RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 1696.68 1699.25 s0001 THE COURT IT NEST THAT COULD PRODUCE A STRUCTURE 
VL-sollesne 1699.26 1703.12 s0001 A COMPUTER NETWORKS COMMUNITY QUOTED JELLYFISH STRUCTURE 
VL-sollesne 1703.13 1705.63 s0001 MATHEMATICIANS CALL IT THE OCTOPUS TEXTURE 
VL-sollesne 1705.64 1710.33 s0001 BUT AT THE END IS BASICALLY THE SAME SORT OF SOME KIND OF BODY WITH SOME KIND OF TENTACLES OF 
VL-sollesne 1710.33 1712.13 s0001 SPEAKING GO 
VL-sollesne 1712.13 1718.03 s0001 SO WITH THESE I HOPE I CONVINCED YOU OR SHOW YOU DEMONSTRATED THAT NETWORKS HAVE 
VL-sollesne 1718.03 1719.39 s0001 THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE 
VL-sollesne 1719.39 1722.86 s0001 SO WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW FOR THE FOR THE NEXT TWENTY MINUTES 
VL-sollesne 1722.87 1725.02 s0001 IS TO FOCUS ON THIS PART OF THE PICTURE 
VL-sollesne 1725.03 1728.65 s0001 OKAY SO NOW I WANT TO GO BACK AND START ACTUALLY SAY OH BUT YOU KNOW 
VL-sollesne 1728.66 1730.73 s0001 IDEALLY I WAS REALLY TELLING YOU HOW 
VL-sollesne 1730.74 1734.71 s0001 HOW CLASSLESS EXISTING THOSE NETWORKS AND NOW FOR TWENTY MINUTES I WAS CONVINCING YOU 
VL-sollesne 1734.72 1738.68 s0001 THAT THERE ARE NO PLASTICS RIGHT SO SORT OF I HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO BED SO 
VL-sollesne 1738.69 1741.70 s0001 I'LL GO THERE AND I'LL I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT COMMUNITIES 
VL-sollesne 1741.71 1743.00 s0001 SO ARM 
VL-sollesne 1743.01 1746.25 s0001 HERE IS THE WAY HOW WE USUALLY DO COMMUNITY DETECTION RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1746.26 1750.23 s0001 SO THE WAY WE DO IT IS THE FOLLOWING WE GO WE TAKE SOME DATA SET MAYBE I TAKE 
VL-sollesne 1750.24 1754.87 s0001 FOR THOSE WHO WHO QUITE FAMILIAR WITH NETWORKS I CONVEYED THE D. V. L. P. DATASET SO THESE ARE 
VL-sollesne 1754.88 1759.09 s0001 OR THE COMPUTER SCIENCE ARTICLE SPEAKING MUCH EVER PUBLISHED RIGHT SO EVERY NODE 
VL-sollesne 1759.10 1764.65 s0001 NOW WHO ARE OUT OF THIS DATA ALRIGHT SO OUT OF THIS COMPUTER SCIENCE OF PUBLICATION DATA 
VL-sollesne 1764.66 1770.51 s0001 I CAN BE PRESENTED AS A GRAPH I CAN REPRESENT IT DOES A COLLABORATION NETWORK RIGHT SO EVERY NODE IS A SCIENTIST 
VL-sollesne 1770.51 1774.65 s0001 AND I CONNECT TO SIGN T. C. B. WROTE A A PAPER TOGETHER RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 1774.66 1778.55 s0001 I KNOW ME AND MONICA WOULD BE CONNECTED BECAUSE WE HAVE A JOINT PAPER TOGETHER 
VL-sollesne 1778.55 1783.71 s0001 SO NOW OKAY I AM A GRAPH AND NOW I COULD TAKE MY FAVOURITE COMEDIAN ADDICTION MATTER 
VL-sollesne 1783.71 1785.15 s0001 AND I WOULD GO TO DETECT 
VL-sollesne 1785.16 1787.06 s0001 CLASS THE SORT OF COMMUNITIES RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1787.07 1789.46 s0001 AND THEN WHAT WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP I DO 
VL-sollesne 1789.47 1792.81 s0001 I GO I EXAMINE DISCUSSED THIS AND I SORT OF TRY TO 
VL-sollesne 1792.82 1798.03 s0001 EVEN TO READ THEM AS I RECALL THAT WAS SORT OF VIDEO COMMUNITIES RIGHT I MAYBE GO AND SAY 
VL-sollesne 1798.04 1799.82 s0001 OH I DISCOVER THE BAYES 
VL-sollesne 1799.83 1803.15 s0001 ON THE AMAZING BASED ON THE NETWORK STRUCTURE IDENTIFY CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 1803.16 1806.40 s0001 BUT THEN I FIGURED OUT THAT ALL THESE NODES MAY BE WORKING THE SAME AREA 
VL-sollesne 1806.40 1808.06 s0001 AND ALL THESE THREE NOTES YOU KNOW 
VL-sollesne 1808.07 1811.31 s0001 A PUBLISHING THE SAME JOURNAL OR COME FROM THE SAME UNIVERSITY OF 
VL-sollesne 1811.32 1812.91 s0001 HAVE SOMETHING ELSE IN COMMON 
VL-sollesne 1812.92 1814.07 s0001 BUT I DON'T OBSERVE 
VL-sollesne 1814.08 1815.36 s0001 UM INTERNET 
VL-sollesne 1815.37 1816.87 s0001 RIGHT SO BASIC UM JUST DRINK 
VL-sollesne 1816.88 1818.53 s0001 NORMAL CLASS THING RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1818.54 1819.59 s0001 SO ON 
VL-sollesne 1819.60 1822.94 s0001 WHAT WE NEED IN THE FOLLOWING THING IS THE FOLLOWING GRIPE IS TO SAY 
VL-sollesne 1822.96 1826.00 s0001 CAN I USE THIS IS THE TYPICAL PIPELINE PEOPLE WHO 
VL-sollesne 1826.01 1830.93 s0001 THIS CAN I GO CAN I FIND DATA SETS THAT ACTUALLY I HAVE SOME KIND OF NOTION OF GROUND TRUTH 
VL-sollesne 1830.94 1832.30 s0001 COULD I SORT OF 
VL-sollesne 1832.30 1836.21 s0001 HAVE DATA SETS WHEN I KNOW WHAT THE CLUSTERS OF I'M LOOKING FOR ARE 
VL-sollesne 1836.21 1839.07 s0001 RIGHT AND HERE IS BASICALLY THE IDEA RIGHT SO SO 
VL-sollesne 1839.07 1841.41 s0001 IS THE IDEA WAS TO GO AND TRY TO FIND 
VL-sollesne 1841.43 1842.47 s0001 NETWORKS WHERE 
VL-sollesne 1842.48 1846.24 s0001 THERE IS AN EXPLICIT NOTION OF GROUND TRUTH RIGHT SO IF I GO BACK TO MY 
VL-sollesne 1846.24 1848.00 s0001 COLLABORATIONS EXAMPLE 
VL-sollesne 1848.01 1849.51 s0001 RIGHT SO MAYBE I WOULD 
VL-sollesne 1849.52 1853.65 s0001 PROXY FOR THE GROUND TRUTH COMMUNITY SEE GLOBAL COLLABORATION NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 1853.66 1856.41 s0001 COULD BE CONFERENCE A SOJOURN STRIKE YOU WOULD THINK THAT 
VL-sollesne 1856.42 1858.20 s0001 IF I TAKE A COLLABORATION AT WORK 
VL-sollesne 1858.20 1863.35 s0001 COMMUNITY SEEN A COLLABORATION NETWORK WOULD RISK CORRESPONDS TO SAINT IF IT BASICALLY IS A SUB DISCIPLINES 
VL-sollesne 1863.36 1868.04 s0001 AND SANDY PIT SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES HAVE THEIR OWN JONAS SO MAYBE A GOOD 
VL-sollesne 1868.05 1870.55 s0001 PROXY FOR A SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY 
VL-sollesne 1870.56 1873.56 s0001 THESE ARE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT PUBLISHING THE SAME JOB 
VL-sollesne 1873.57 1877.31 s0001 AND ACTUALLY WE HAVE THE DATA YOU KNOW WHERE THE PAPERS WERE PUBLISHED RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1877.32 1878.61 s0001 IS SOCIAL NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 1878.62 1879.77 s0001 PEOPLE UM 
VL-sollesne 1879.78 1889.28 s0001 CREATE AND JOINING OF TWO GROUPS RIGHT SO ON FACEBOOK YOU CAN CREATE A GROUP AND YOUR FRIENDS CAN JOIN ON MANY OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS YOU CAN CREATE GROUPS RIGHT SO AGAIN THIS CAN BE 
VL-sollesne 1889.29 1892.31 s0001 A NOTION OF GROUND TRUTH CLUSTERS AND 
VL-sollesne 1892.32 1896.31 s0001 UM FOR EXAMPLE IN INFORMATION NETWORKS THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE WE LOOK UP 
VL-sollesne 1896.32 1898.37 s0001 IS BASICALLY YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT SORT OF 
VL-sollesne 1898.38 1902.04 s0001 CREATED IT THIS TOPIC THE COHESION OF OR 
VL-sollesne 1902.05 1904.00 s0001 GROUPS BASED ON TOPICS 
VL-sollesne 1904.01 1905.84 s0001 SO REALLY THE IDEA I USE 
VL-sollesne 1905.85 1907.39 s0001 BUT I HAVE NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 1907.40 1908.44 s0001 MAYBE LIKE THIS 
VL-sollesne 1908.45 1909.55 s0001 AND THEY KNOW THAT 
VL-sollesne 1909.56 1913.11 s0001 THAT IS ME WHAT COMMUNITY OR WHAT GROUP IT BELONGS END 
VL-sollesne 1913.12 1919.16 s0001 IN THIS CASE I JUST DREW THE THE WAY THE EXAMPLE IN SUCH A WAY THAT EVERY NODE BELONGS TO A SINGLE COMMUNITY 
VL-sollesne 1919.17 1921.75 s0001 BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN BE LONG COMMUTE PEOPLE GROUPS 
VL-sollesne 1921.75 1924.52 s0001 RIGHT AND THE DATA SAID THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FIND THE CAB 
VL-sollesne 1924.52 1927.96 s0001 WELL THESE DATA IS AVAILABLE OR ARE UP HERE RIGHT AWAY THAT YOU HAVE 
VL-sollesne 1927.97 1929.67 s0001 ON SOCIAL NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 1929.68 1931.75 s0001 A COLLABORATION NETWORK AND SOME 
VL-sollesne 1931.76 1934.53 s0001 AND AH AMAZON PROGRESS COMMENDATION NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1934.54 1936.76 s0001 A NUMBER OF NOTES NUMBER OFFENDERS 
VL-sollesne 1936.77 1940.27 s0001 THIS IS THE NUMBER OF PLASTER SO NUMBER OF GROUND TRUTH GROUPS 
VL-sollesne 1940.28 1944.34 s0001 BUT I SEE A S. IS THAT EVERY SIZE OF THE GROUP AND EIGHTIES 
VL-sollesne 1944.35 1948.40 s0001 THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF GROUPS I'M NOT A NODE BELONGS RIGHT SO IN SOME 
VL-sollesne 1948.41 1952.97 s0001 IN SOME OF THESE SOME NETWORKS A UH NO BELONG SCOOP AND SO GROUPS WHILE 
VL-sollesne 1952.98 1957.74 s0001 IN OTHER IN OTHER NETWORKS NODES DON'T TELL US WHAT GROUP THEY BELONG OKAY 
VL-sollesne 1957.75 1961.45 s0001 BUT THIS IS BASICALLY READ WE RESTART SO WHAT WE HAVE NOW 
VL-sollesne 1961.46 1962.72 s0001 IS I HAVE A NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1962.73 1964.09 s0001 AND FOR EVERY NODE 
VL-sollesne 1964.10 1967.85 s0001 I SORT OF KNOW WHAT GROUP IT BELONGS TO WHAT CLUSTERED ALONG SCHOOL 
VL-sollesne 1967.85 1970.32 s0001 OKAY SO IF I HAD THIS KIND OF A TOP 
VL-sollesne 1970.33 1971.39 s0001 WHAT CAN I DO 
VL-sollesne 1971.40 1973.99 s0001 SO THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT THINGS THAT I CAN READ 
VL-sollesne 1973.99 1976.83 s0001 SO THE FIRST THING IS I CAN ACTUALLY STAND GOING INSANE 
VL-sollesne 1976.84 1980.82 s0001 RIGHT BEFORE I WAS TELLING YOU A GROUP IS A SET OF SNOW THAT HAS LOTS OF CONNECTIONS 
VL-sollesne 1980.83 1983.91 s0001 UM BETWEEN THE MEMBER SINCE YOU POINTING OUTSIDE RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 1983.93 1990.91 s0001 NOW I CAN THINK IS GROUNDED GROUPS AND SAY OLD LADY HAS THAT PROPERTY RIGHT IS THIS CITY THE PROPERTY THAT I SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR 
VL-sollesne 1990.92 1993.85 s0001 IN MY NETWORKS IF I WANT TO IDENTIFY DISCUSSED 
VL-sollesne 1993.85 1996.76 s0001 SO REALLY THE QUESTION IS I CAN TAKE YOU STUDY 
VL-sollesne 1996.77 1999.22 s0001 HOW THESE GROUPS MET ON THE TOP OF THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 1999.23 2003.45 s0001 AND THIS WILL GIVE ME INSIGHT ALTITUDES DESIGN BETTER COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS 
VL-sollesne 2003.46 2006.13 s0001 ON THE SECOND THING THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IS THAT 
VL-sollesne 2006.14 2007.38 s0001 NOW I CAN DO THAT 
VL-sollesne 2007.39 2010.60 s0001 SORT OF PROPER EVALUATION METHODS RIGHT I CAN SORT OF 
VL-sollesne 2010.61 2013.03 s0001 START COMPUTING DO CURIOUSLY OF MY 
VL-sollesne 2013.04 2015.99 s0001 OR MIGHT CLUSTERING WERE MY COMMUNITY DETECTION OF GOD 
VL-sollesne 2016.00 2017.96 s0001 WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT I CAN MAKE MY 
VL-sollesne 2017.97 2019.21 s0001 MY EMPTY NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 2019.22 2021.14 s0001 LIKE SO I LIKE A BIT OF THAT 
VL-sollesne 2021.15 2022.24 s0001 I DO MY 
VL-sollesne 2022.25 2024.90 s0001 MY COMMUNITY DETECTION METHOD AND NOW I CAN SAY 
VL-sollesne 2024.91 2026.73 s0001 HOW WELL DOES FOR EXAMPLE THIS COMMUNITY 
VL-sollesne 2026.74 2033.46 s0001 CORRESPOND TO A YOU KNOW DO THIS OR THIS CLUSTERS OR THIS KNOW THAT I DO THAT BUT I IDENTIFY BELONG POKEMON HERE 
VL-sollesne 2033.47 2035.74 s0001 WE REALLY BELONG TO THE SAME COMMUNITY RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 2035.75 2040.84 s0001 MAYBE I HEAR YOU SEE I I WAS ABLE TO BUY MY METHOD IDENTIFIED THIS COMMUNITY CORRECTLY 
VL-sollesne 2040.85 2044.07 s0001 BUT IT TOTALLY SCREWED UP IN THIS PART OF THE NETWORK RIGHT SO NOW I CAN 
VL-sollesne 2044.08 2045.19 s0001 MEASURE 
VL-sollesne 2045.21 2047.79 s0001 AND A CURIOUS YOU'RE MY MATTER 
VL-sollesne 2047.80 2050.61 s0001 RIGHT SO THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT I CAN DO AND I'LL GIVE YOU 
VL-sollesne 2050.62 2053.19 s0001 EXAMPLES OF BOTH OF THESE ARE CASES 
VL-sollesne 2053.19 2056.66 s0001 RIGHT SO IF I NOW WANT TO STUDY COLOR THIS VIDEO GROUPS 
VL-sollesne 2056.67 2059.42 s0001 MAP ON THE ON THE ON THE TOP OF THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 2059.42 2062.04 s0001 HE'S THE MOST SIMPLE QUESTION YOU CAN ASK YOU CAN SAY 
VL-sollesne 2062.06 2063.96 s0001 I HAVE TWO NOTES FROM 
VL-sollesne 2063.96 2068.96 s0001 THEY SHARE A K. GROUPS SO THEY THEY BELONG TO K. GROUP THEY HAVE K. GROUPS IN COMMON 
VL-sollesne 2068.98 2070.48 s0001 WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT 
VL-sollesne 2070.48 2072.75 s0001 YOU ARE UN T. V. BEATING 
VL-sollesne 2072.77 2075.42 s0001 LINKED AS A NUMBER OF OTHER GROUPS THEY HAVE IN COMMON 
VL-sollesne 2075.44 2077.67 s0001 OKAY SORT OF SUPER SIMPLE QUESTION 
VL-sollesne 2077.67 2080.91 s0001 SO THE WAY PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS IS THE FOLLOWING RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 2080.92 2084.39 s0001 SO THE FIRST YOU OFF NETWORK COMMUNITY DETECTION WHICH IS 
VL-sollesne 2084.40 2086.76 s0001 THE INTUITION I WAS SENDING YOU ALL ALONG ABOUT 
VL-sollesne 2086.77 2090.66 s0001 FINDING SETS OF NODES EAT LOTS OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF THE OUTSIDE 
VL-sollesne 2090.67 2091.71 s0001 THEN YOU THAT 
VL-sollesne 2091.71 2092.77 s0001 UM YOU KNOW 
VL-sollesne 2092.78 2102.59 s0001 YOU DON'T YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED BASICALLY YOU ONLY BELONG TO A SINGLE GROUP SO THIS QUESTION DOESN'T EVEN APPLY SO THAT THE MENTAL PICTURE OF THE NETWORK OF HAVING YOUR HEAD IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
VL-sollesne 2102.59 2107.40 s0001 THEN THE NEXT THING IS TO SAY OKAY WHAT IS MY GROUP'S OVERLAP IN THE WAY 
VL-sollesne 2107.41 2109.94 s0001 PEOPLE THINK ABOUT OVERLAPPING GROUPS TODAY 
VL-sollesne 2109.94 2113.39 s0001 IS BASICALLY SOMETHING CLYDE IS BASICALLY THEY SAY THAT THERE ARE THESE NODES 
VL-sollesne 2113.41 2117.56 s0001 THAT AND ONES THAT BELONG TO MULTIPLE GROUPS BUT HE'S DEAD NOW THAT BASICALLY 
VL-sollesne 2117.57 2122.64 s0001 THEY DON'T NEED TO ONE ANOTHER SO THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE PROBABILITY OF FINANCIAL DECREASES 
VL-sollesne 2122.65 2127.81 s0001 AS A AS A AS AN UM AS THE NUMBER OF COMMON GROUPS INCREASES BETWEEN THE TWO PEOPLE 
VL-sollesne 2127.82 2129.23 s0001 RIGHT IT'S A TOUGH 
VL-sollesne 2129.23 2131.62 s0001 UM MAYBE DOESN'T MAKE TOO MUCH SENSE 
VL-sollesne 2131.62 2133.62 s0001 SO WHAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO IS 
VL-sollesne 2133.63 2137.90 s0001 GIVEN THAT WE HAVE THESE GROUND TRUTH I CAN GO AND MEASURE THESE RIGHT SO WHAT I HAVE HERE IS 
VL-sollesne 2137.90 2140.05 s0001 OF WHAT EVERY BETTER FOR MILES I ASK 
VL-sollesne 2140.06 2141.21 s0001 HOW MANY GROUPS 
VL-sollesne 2141.21 2144.69 s0001 DO YOU HAVE IN COMMON RIGHT HOW MANY COMMON GROUPS GREW BELONG TO 
VL-sollesne 2144.71 2147.14 s0001 VERSUS WAS A PROBABILITY OF A NET RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 2147.14 2149.27 s0001 AND OF THE THING GOES UP 
VL-sollesne 2149.27 2151.55 s0001 SO REALLY WHAT DOES THIS TELL ME 
VL-sollesne 2151.55 2155.26 s0001 RIGHT SO THAT THIS THIS THING THIS TELLS ME IS THE FOLLOWING RIGHT IS IT DOES MEAN THAT 
VL-sollesne 2155.27 2159.19 s0001 THE MORE GROUPS WE HAVE IN COMMON THE MORE LIKELY WHAT THE ART OF TO BE CONNECTED 
VL-sollesne 2159.19 2160.56 s0001 RIGHT WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT 
VL-sollesne 2160.57 2161.73 s0001 THE 
VL-sollesne 2161.73 2165.78 s0001 THE MORE COMMUNITIES OVERLAP IN IN A PARTICULAR PART OF THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 2165.78 2168.54 s0001 THE MORE AND JUST ARE THERE IN THAT PART OF THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 2168.55 2170.98 s0001 RIGHT SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE PICTURE RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 2170.98 2175.35 s0001 SO THE WAY THE WAY I CAN THINK ABOUT THIS IS THE FOLLOWING GREAT SO CARRY HAVE 
VL-sollesne 2175.36 2181.50 s0001 A CITY TO EXAMPLE NETWORKS IN HERE I HAVE THE CORRESPONDING ADJACENT SEA MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 2181.51 2182.81 s0001 KNOWNS NODES 
VL-sollesne 2182.82 2186.80 s0001 A EMPTY SPACE MEANS THERE'S NO EDGE OF BOUGHT MEANS THERE IS A NET RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 2186.81 2187.92 s0001 SO REALLY 
VL-sollesne 2187.92 2189.25 s0001 IF I BUY 
VL-sollesne 2189.26 2193.34 s0001 IF I THINK OF NETWORK COMMUNITIES UH SOME KIND OF GRAPH PETITIONING PROBLEM 
VL-sollesne 2193.35 2195.31 s0001 THEN I'M MAKING AN ASSUMPTION THAT MY 
VL-sollesne 2195.33 2199.86 s0001 ADJACENT SEA MATRIX LOOKS LIKE THIS RIGHT I HAVE A CLUSTER LOTS OF CONNECTIONS ANOTHER PLASTER 
VL-sollesne 2199.86 2202.05 s0001 AND A FEW CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 2202.06 2203.10 s0001 IF I BUY 
VL-sollesne 2203.11 2204.75 s0001 FOR EXAMPLE OR IF I 
VL-sollesne 2204.75 2207.54 s0001 MY PICTURE MY NOTION OF NETWORK COMMUNITIES 
VL-sollesne 2207.55 2211.99 s0001 THESE THESE OF SORT OF FINDING ARTICULATION POINTS WHICH IS WHICH IS WHAT 
VL-sollesne 2212.00 2214.65 s0001 UM CLICK CLICK RELATION METHOD DOES AND SO ON 
VL-sollesne 2214.66 2219.98 s0001 IN IN WHAT THE WAY I THINK OF OUR JESSE MAYBE SHE'S THE FOLLOWING RIGHT OCAMPO CLUSTERS THEY OVERLAP 
VL-sollesne 2219.98 2221.12 s0001 BUT THE OVERLAP IS 
VL-sollesne 2221.14 2222.67 s0001 LESS WELL CONNECTED THAN 
VL-sollesne 2222.67 2225.96 s0001 EACH OF THE TWO NON OVERLAPPING PARTS OF THE LAST STRIKE 
VL-sollesne 2225.98 2231.46 s0001 AND SORT OF WHAT HAPPENS THE INTUITION THAT COMES FROM THE PLOT IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE IS THE FOLLOWING RIGHT IS 
VL-sollesne 2231.48 2233.27 s0001 IF I HAVE TO COMMUNITIES THAT OVERLAP 
VL-sollesne 2233.28 2236.08 s0001 THEN I CAN THE MOST AT JUSTIN OVER THERE 
VL-sollesne 2236.08 2238.19 s0001 RIGHT SO ANY MY POINT IS THAT 
VL-sollesne 2238.19 2239.60 s0001 THE WORLD IS NOT LIKE THAT 
VL-sollesne 2239.62 2241.12 s0001 BUT IT'S LIKE THIS 
VL-sollesne 2241.13 2243.12 s0001 AND NOW THE QUESTION IS 
VL-sollesne 2243.13 2247.51 s0001 HOW CAN A GOAL DETECT COMMUNITIES MIGHT LOOK HOW CAN I GO TO TECH CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 2247.52 2249.73 s0001 IF THESE CLASSES HAVE SUCH A STRUCTURE 
VL-sollesne 2249.75 2250.79 s0001 RIGHT BECAUSE 
VL-sollesne 2250.80 2251.98 s0001 METHODS THE BAYES 
VL-sollesne 2251.98 2255.14 s0001 BUT THE BAYES AND EASY BRING IN THAT INTUITION OR THIS INTUITION 
VL-sollesne 2255.16 2257.25 s0001 WITH FAIL IN THIS CASE 
VL-sollesne 2257.27 2258.98 s0001 SO THE QUESTION IS 
VL-sollesne 2258.98 2261.81 s0001 ON HOW WASTED GOING TO TECH CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 2261.82 2264.63 s0001 SO THE WAY I REALLY DO THIS IS THE FOLLOWING 
VL-sollesne 2264.71 2267.31 s0001 I WILL I WILL BASICALLY DO 
VL-sollesne 2267.32 2270.78 s0001 LIKE A MODEL BASED COMMUNITY DETECTION SO I WILL SHOW YOU 
VL-sollesne 2270.79 2274.30 s0001 A VERY SIMPLE MODEL HOLLOW NETWORKS CAN BE GENERATED 
VL-sollesne 2274.31 2276.96 s0001 AND THEN WE WILL FEED THAT MODEL BACK TO THE DATA 
VL-sollesne 2276.96 2279.48 s0001 RIGHT SO MY MONEY IS VERY SIMPLE IT IS A 
VL-sollesne 2279.48 2282.92 s0001 BASICALLY UM WHAT I CALL MY RECORD MY MODEL A 
VL-sollesne 2282.94 2285.14 s0001 COMMUNITY AFFILIATION GRAPH MODEL SO 
VL-sollesne 2285.15 2287.25 s0001 THE VERSE STRUCTURE IS VERY SIMPLE 
VL-sollesne 2287.26 2290.32 s0001 SO THE BOTTOM LINE OUT OF MY NOTES OF THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 2290.33 2293.31 s0001 AH THE THE TOP ARE MY COMMUNITIES 
VL-sollesne 2293.32 2296.83 s0001 ON ALL THESE CONNECTED TO THE COMMUNITIES IT BELONGS TO 
VL-sollesne 2296.84 2299.75 s0001 SO ALL THE NODES BELONG TO THE COMMUNITY A 
VL-sollesne 2299.75 2302.08 s0001 OR THE BLUE NOTES BELONG TO THE COMMUNITY BE 
VL-sollesne 2302.09 2306.02 s0001 AND ALL OF THE WORD AND KNOWS THEY BELONG TO BOTH COMMUNITIES RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 2306.02 2307.67 s0001 SO VERY SIMPLE SO 
VL-sollesne 2307.69 2308.79 s0001 WHAT IT SAYS IS 
VL-sollesne 2308.80 2312.83 s0001 NOW I HAVE UM ARE NOW I HAVE MY NOTES OF THE SOCIAL NETWORK AT THE BOTTOM 
VL-sollesne 2312.84 2314.48 s0001 I HAVE COMMUNITIES ON THE TOP 
VL-sollesne 2314.48 2316.25 s0001 AND I JUST MEAN MEMBERSHIPS 
VL-sollesne 2316.27 2317.48 s0001 SO NOW THE QUESTION IS 
VL-sollesne 2317.50 2318.75 s0001 GIVEN THESE KIND OF 
VL-sollesne 2318.76 2321.83 s0001 A GRAPH HOW DO I GENERATE THE SOCIAL NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 2321.84 2324.75 s0001 THE WAY I REGENERATE THE SOCIAL NETWORK IS VERY SIMPLE 
VL-sollesne 2324.75 2326.38 s0001 FOR EVERY PAIR OF NODES 
VL-sollesne 2326.39 2327.46 s0001 I WILL JUST SAY 
VL-sollesne 2327.48 2330.36 s0001 OF AND FOR EVERY COMMUNITY THAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON 
VL-sollesne 2330.37 2331.67 s0001 I MEAN SWEEP A COIN 
VL-sollesne 2331.69 2334.53 s0001 AND NEED THAT PARTICULAR PROBABILITY THAT THEY HAVE A BAD 
VL-sollesne 2334.54 2336.36 s0001 THE CORN YOU DO MANAGE 
VL-sollesne 2336.37 2337.83 s0001 SO ON 
VL-sollesne 2337.84 2340.30 s0001 YEAH AND OF COURSE NOW IT'S ANY 
VL-sollesne 2340.31 2341.35 s0001 EASY TO SEE THAT 
VL-sollesne 2341.36 2342.60 s0001 IF IF I HAVE 
VL-sollesne 2342.61 2343.82 s0001 IF THESE TWO NODES HAVE 
VL-sollesne 2343.82 2345.12 s0001 COMMUNITIES IN COMMON 
VL-sollesne 2345.13 2346.75 s0001 THEY GET TO SLEEP ONE COIN 
VL-sollesne 2346.76 2352.56 s0001 AND TO GET TO SLEEP ANOTHER QUITE RIGHT SO THE MORE COMMUNITIES WE HAVE IN COMMON THE MORE THAN ONE QUITE AS WE GET TO SLEEP 
VL-sollesne 2352.57 2354.67 s0001 THE MORE LIKELY WE WILL HAVE A MARRIAGE 
VL-sollesne 2354.67 2355.91 s0001 A BETWEEN US 
VL-sollesne 2355.92 2357.90 s0001 SO MANY NATURALLY MODELS 
VL-sollesne 2357.90 2361.73 s0001 OF THE PLOT THAT I SHOWED YOU BEFORE SORT OF THAT 
VL-sollesne 2361.73 2367.87 s0001 BETTER MORTGAGE ASSISI SHARE MORE COMMUNITIES RIGHT SO HERE'S THE FARMER AT THE PROBABILITY OF FINANCIAL SIMPLY 
VL-sollesne 2367.88 2371.29 s0001 UM OF I GO AT ALL THE COMMUNITIES WE HAVE IN COMMON 
VL-sollesne 2371.30 2380.62 s0001 THIS IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THE THAT DO NOT BASE AGAIN THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NONE OF THESE COIN FLIP SUCCEEDS LIKE IF AT LEAST ONE OF THEM SUCCEEDS WE CREATE AN EDGE 
VL-sollesne 2380.63 2383.30 s0001 BETWEEN ARE MY NOTES OF THIS OCEAN 
VL-sollesne 2383.31 2384.77 s0001 RIGHT SO NOW 
VL-sollesne 2384.78 2389.07 s0001 WHAT I CAN DO IS I HAVE A MODEL OF HOW NETWORKS CAN BE GENERATED 
VL-sollesne 2389.07 2391.78 s0001 UM WHAT IS CUTE IS ACTUALLY THAT THAT 
VL-sollesne 2391.79 2394.50 s0001 THIS YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY ANALYSE THIS MODEL 
VL-sollesne 2394.52 2398.87 s0001 AND FOR EXAMPLE PROVE THAT YOU CAN GET FOLLOW THE DISTRIBUTIONS AND ALL OF THEM 
VL-sollesne 2398.88 2400.19 s0001 OTHER NICE THINGS 
VL-sollesne 2400.19 2403.62 s0001 BUT THAT SORT OF NOT IMPORTANT FOR US WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR US IS THAT 
VL-sollesne 2403.64 2405.56 s0001 WE HAVE THIS MODEL OF NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 2405.57 2411.35 s0001 BUT DESPITE AMORTIZED BY BY THESE PARAMETERS TRY TO HAVE MY WORK EXCEPT SO MY NOTES OF THE SOCIAL NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 2411.36 2413.67 s0001 OKAY MY COMMUNITIES VISEGRAD NODES 
VL-sollesne 2413.67 2415.46 s0001 I HAVE MY MEMBERSHIP AND JUST 
VL-sollesne 2415.48 2422.38 s0001 AND I HAVE THESE PARAMETERS THAT DANNY HOW LIKE THE ARTICLE NOTES TO BE CONNECTED IS THEY BELONG TO THAT PARTICULAR COMMON COMMUNITY 
VL-sollesne 2422.38 2424.80 s0001 RIGHT SO WHAT THEY CAN DO NOW IS 
VL-sollesne 2424.80 2431.04 s0001 I CAN DO THE FOLLOWING THING RIGHT SO WHAT I'M SHOWING YOU SO FAR LESS TO SAY IF I IF I DO THIS KIND OF BY PARAGRAPH 
VL-sollesne 2431.05 2433.25 s0001 YOU KNOW HOW TO GENERATE THE NETWORK RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 2433.26 2437.84 s0001 FOR EVERY A PAIR OF NOTES HERE YOU FLIP A COIN AND YOU CONNECT THEM THERE 
VL-sollesne 2439.15 2442.46 s0001 WHAT I CAN ALSO DO IS I CAN GO THE OTHER WAY I CAN SAY 
VL-sollesne 2442.46 2444.66 s0001 UH GIVEN THE NETWORK FIGURED OUT 
VL-sollesne 2444.67 2447.66 s0001 OF THE MODEL RIGHT SO FIGURE OUT THESE BY BUT I'VE GOT 
VL-sollesne 2447.66 2450.00 s0001 UM SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY FIGURE OUT THE GRAPH 
VL-sollesne 2450.02 2451.06 s0001 FIGURE OUT 
VL-sollesne 2451.07 2452.91 s0001 UH THE STRUCTURE OF THIS NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 2452.92 2456.66 s0001 FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES SO THE NUMBER OF SQUARE MILES 
VL-sollesne 2456.67 2461.52 s0001 AND THE FIGURE OUT THE PARAMETERS USE A BAROMETER SPEAK OF THAT RIGHT 
VL-sollesne 2461.52 2463.15 s0001 UM AND AGAIN 
VL-sollesne 2463.16 2467.39 s0001 THE THING IS THAT AH YOU CAN GO INTO A 
VL-sollesne 2467.39 2469.87 s0001 THE WAY WE DO THAT IS ON 
VL-sollesne 2469.89 2472.33 s0001 IS VERY SORT OF IT'S A RELATIVELY SIMPLE 
VL-sollesne 2472.34 2475.23 s0001 SO IT'S A SYMBOL MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD UM 
VL-sollesne 2475.23 2477.81 s0001 ESTIMATION PROBLEM RIGHT I'M JUST SAYING 
VL-sollesne 2477.82 2479.17 s0001 UM GIVEN MY GRAPH 
VL-sollesne 2479.17 2480.71 s0001 WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY 
VL-sollesne 2480.71 2487.25 s0001 A MODEL THAT HE'S GOT HIS URGE EVEN ARGUED THAT THAT COULD HAVE GENERATED MY VIDEO THAT UP 
VL-sollesne 2487.26 2488.30 s0001 AND UM 
VL-sollesne 2488.31 2489.94 s0001 THE WAY I SAW THIS AT THE END 
VL-sollesne 2489.96 2493.91 s0001 IS BASICALLY I'D I'M DOING SOME KIND OF COORDINATE COORDINATE THE SAND 
VL-sollesne 2493.91 2495.83 s0001 WHEN IN THE FIRST STEP I'M SORT OF 
VL-sollesne 2495.84 2497.92 s0001 IT'S CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF MY GRASS 
VL-sollesne 2497.92 2499.33 s0001 ANY THE SECOND STEP 
VL-sollesne 2499.34 2510.45 s0001 I'M A FIXING MY GRAPH AND I'M FIGURING OUT WHAT THIS PLATONIC THIS LINKING PROBABILITY SHOULD BE A NIGHT OF A REPEAT IS A LONG ENOUGH AND SORT OF I CONVERGE AND FIND A GOOD GOOD 
VL-sollesne 2510.44 2511.60 s0001 OKAY SO 
VL-sollesne 2511.60 2516.06 s0001 AH THIS IS A THIS IS THE POINT IN BEING HERE IS THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU DO THIS 
VL-sollesne 2516.07 2519.23 s0001 ON SYNTHETIC THEY DINE MEASURE HOW WELL ARE YOU DOING 
VL-sollesne 2519.23 2521.91 s0001 AND IT SORT OF WORKS WELL IN PRACTISE 
VL-sollesne 2521.92 2526.35 s0001 BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS THE FOLLOWING RIGHT IS THAT I CAN THINK OF THE GRAPH 
VL-sollesne 2526.36 2528.84 s0001 MY SOCIAL NETWORK AND I CAN FIGURE OUT 
VL-sollesne 2528.85 2532.71 s0001 MY COMMUNITY AFFILIATION GO RIGHT I CAN FIGURE OUT FOR EVERY NODE 
VL-sollesne 2532.71 2535.00 s0001 WHAT COMMUNITY SHE BELONGS TO DOESN'T EVEN 
VL-sollesne 2535.01 2536.81 s0001 GIVEN A GRAPH LIKE THAT 
VL-sollesne 2536.82 2540.04 s0001 AND THEN THE OTHER THING I CAN DO I CAN ALSO GO BACK AND SAY 
VL-sollesne 2540.05 2550.52 s0001 NOW I WHEN I SEE THAT THE MODEL TO THAT I REALLY DISCOVERED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE I I I DISK I DECIDED TO TEACH NODES BELONG TO WHAT COMMUNITIES SO NOW I CAN GO AND START COMPARING 
VL-sollesne 2550.53 2556.79 s0001 MY AH MY INFLATE COMMUNITY SWEDE IDIOT COMMUNITIES SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS RIGHT I CAN TAKE MY NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 2556.80 2560.28 s0001 MIGHT BE SCARLESS CORRESPOND DIRTY OWN GROUP MEMBERSHIPS 
VL-sollesne 2560.29 2561.75 s0001 AND MAYBE THESE UM 
VL-sollesne 2561.76 2563.73 s0001 UM THE CIRCUS OR THE SET 
VL-sollesne 2563.73 2571.25 s0001 SETS INDICATE THAT YOU PUT COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIPS RIGHT NOW I CAN SAY YOU KNOW HOW WELL HOW ANYBODY DISCOVERED THESE COLORS 
VL-sollesne 2571.27 2573.86 s0001 BUT BASED SOLELY ON THE NETWORK STRUCTURE 
VL-sollesne 2573.86 2578.36 s0001 AND THEN A FEW MEASURE MEASURE SORT METHODS THAT ALREADY STANDARD IN COMPUTER SCIENCE 
VL-sollesne 2578.36 2581.82 s0001 TO EVALUATE A THIS KIND OF A 
VL-sollesne 2581.83 2586.35 s0001 OF PROBLEMS RIGHT SO THERE IS THE ESCORT OF THE S. ONE SCORE THE PRECISION AND RECALL 
VL-sollesne 2586.36 2588.51 s0001 YOU CAN MEASURE THE MUTUAL INFORMATION 
VL-sollesne 2588.52 2591.28 s0001 WE DO THE DISCOVERED COMMUNITY CENTRE TO COMMUNITIES 
VL-sollesne 2591.29 2595.21 s0001 WOULD YOU CAN QUANTIFY SOMETHING THAT IS CALLED ALL MY INDEX 
VL-sollesne 2595.23 2596.69 s0001 AND THEN FOR COMPARISON 
VL-sollesne 2596.71 2605.04 s0001 I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO COMPARE AND MY METHOD RIGHT SO WHAT IS MY METHOD GIVEN A NETWORK I WANT TO FIND THE PARAMETERS OF THIS MODEL WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT I 
VL-sollesne 2605.04 2609.60 s0001 I FOUND THE GROUP MEMBERSHIPS AND NOW I WILL COMPARE HOW RUDE GROUPS I FIND 
VL-sollesne 2609.60 2611.48 s0001 THIS IS THE TWO STANDARD METHODS 
VL-sollesne 2611.50 2613.91 s0001 ONE IS CALLED CLICK POPULATION 
VL-sollesne 2613.92 2615.41 s0001 AND THE OTHER ONE WAS JUST PUBLISHED 
VL-sollesne 2615.42 2621.80 s0001 IT'S CALLED LINK CLUSTERING SO INVOLVED THIS MASK METHODS FIND GROUPS THAT OVER THE RIGHT SORT OF 
VL-sollesne 2621.80 2624.58 s0001 THEY ALLOWED NOTES TO BELONG TO MOVE PEOPLE GROUPS 
VL-sollesne 2624.65 2627.51 s0001 AND IF YOU DON OUR MASTER 
VL-sollesne 2627.52 2629.60 s0001 A CASE HALLWAY LEADS DRINK 
VL-sollesne 2629.60 2632.54 s0001 AH THESE AH SO I HAVE DIFFERENT DATA SETS 
VL-sollesne 2632.55 2634.89 s0001 DIFFERENCE COURSE HIGHER IS BETTER 
VL-sollesne 2634.90 2638.21 s0001 WHAT I'M SHOWING YOU IS A RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT 
VL-sollesne 2638.22 2642.87 s0001 OF OUR METHOD OVER IN THIS CASE THE LINK CLUSTERING RIGHT ON 
VL-sollesne 2642.87 2645.79 s0001 AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT HERE FOR EXAMPLE 
VL-sollesne 2645.80 2648.63 s0001 THE OTHER WE DO SEVENTY TIMES BETTER IN 
VL-sollesne 2648.64 2651.62 s0001 DECIDING HOW MANY COMMUNITY SIDE BENDING THE NETWORK 
VL-sollesne 2651.64 2654.90 s0001 AND WE ALSO DO BETTER IN TERMS OF THEIR SCORN OR MIGRAINE X. 
VL-sollesne 2654.91 2659.22 s0001 BUT IT AND SO FUTURE INFORMATION WE DO A BIT WORSE SO THIS IS FALLING CLUSTERING 
VL-sollesne 2659.22 2661.85 s0001 AND THIS IS THE RESULTS FOR THE CLICK CLICK RELATION 
VL-sollesne 2661.86 2666.51 s0001 UM AND AGAIN SORT OF THE DETECT COMMUNITIES THAT CORRESPONDED REAL ONES 
VL-sollesne 2666.51 2669.44 s0001 MUCH BETTER THAN THE POPULATION 
VL-sollesne 2669.45 2672.29 s0001 UM THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO SHOW 
VL-sollesne 2672.30 2679.23 s0001 HE'S ALSO SO ANOTHER WAY HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT THE D. C.'S JUST SORT OF TO SAY CAN USE THE PERFORMANCE AUTOMATICALLY CORPORATION 
VL-sollesne 2679.24 2682.20 s0001 THIS IS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OTHER OF OUR TEAM EFFORT 
VL-sollesne 2682.21 2684.85 s0001 AH FOR THE CITY DIFFERENT UM 
VL-sollesne 2684.85 2686.65 s0001 A PERFORMANCE METRICS 
VL-sollesne 2686.66 2691.08 s0001 IF IN THE BODIES OF A THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE BETTER IF IT'S BELOW THEIR GROWTH 
VL-sollesne 2691.10 2693.19 s0001 THE COMPETITION DOES BETTER 
VL-sollesne 2693.20 2697.49 s0001 UM HE IT SNOWED IS NO DOUBT THAT SORT OF WE DO BETTER THAN IN CUSTODY 
VL-sollesne 2697.50 2700.40 s0001 FOR QUICK REGULATION ACTUALLY ALSO TOO MUCH BUT LIKE 
VL-sollesne 2700.41 2704.03 s0001 SO THIS IS JUST A VISUAL WAY TO LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS TABLE 
VL-sollesne 2704.04 2708.56 s0001 THAT SORT OF A A TALL SIZING UP ALL SORT OF QUALITY RANGES 
VL-sollesne 2708.56 2710.81 s0001 OF YOU FIND BETTER TASKS 
VL-sollesne 2710.82 2716.49 s0001 UM SO JUST TO GIVE YOU MAYBE A SMALL EXAMPLE OF OF HOW HOW YOU FIND CLUSTERS 
VL-sollesne 2716.50 2721.74 s0001 SO WHAT IS THIS IS IS A IS EGO NETWORK OF ONE OF MY STUDENTS SO THIS IS A 
VL-sollesne 2721.75 2724.18 s0001 AH ONE OF MY KOREAN STUDENTS WHO TOOK 
VL-sollesne 2724.19 2734.63 s0001 OR HE'S A FACEBOOK FRIENDS AND THEN TIED TO A LABELLED A GOOD LIVING TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS AND HE HE HE DECIDED HE HE HAS FOUR GROUPS OF HIS FANCY CARE SORT OF 
VL-sollesne 2734.64 2736.68 s0001 FRANCE FROM HIS CAREER IN HIGH SCHOOL 
VL-sollesne 2736.69 2744.13 s0001 AH AH AH AH FRANCE FROM HIS WORKPLACE BASICALLY EVERYWHERE HE DID AN INTERNSHIP AND THEN HE CARES 
VL-sollesne 2744.13 2746.08 s0001 TWO SETS OF STANFORD FRIENDS 
VL-sollesne 2746.09 2748.14 s0001 ONE WITH WHOM HE PLAY SQUASH 
VL-sollesne 2748.15 2753.49 s0001 AND THE OTHER ONE ARM HE'S SORT OF OF BASKETBALL FRIENDS AND UM 
VL-sollesne 2753.50 2756.25 s0001 A WHAT I SHOW YOU HERE IS 
VL-sollesne 2756.26 2757.64 s0001 AND EVERY 
VL-sollesne 2757.65 2760.97 s0001 IS THE COMMUNITIES OUR METHOD WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY 
VL-sollesne 2760.98 2765.23 s0001 FOR EXAMPLE THESE ARE NO THAT DON'T BELONG TO ANY FOR ANY OF THE GROUPS THAT ARE WERE 
VL-sollesne 2765.24 2768.20 s0001 WE DECIDED NOT TO CLASSIFY 
VL-sollesne 2768.21 2771.98 s0001 AND THE OPEN CIRCLES SIDE OF THE ARE THE MISTAKES RIGHT SO 
VL-sollesne 2771.99 2775.75 s0001 FOR CIRCUS ARE THE CERTAIN ARE GOOD KNOWS WHERE WE MADE THE CORRECT GUESS 
VL-sollesne 2775.76 2781.53 s0001 AND THE DA DA EMPTY CIRCUS ARE THE MISTAKES BUT WHAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU HERE IS BASICALLY THAT 
VL-sollesne 2781.54 2783.88 s0001 THE PLACE WHERE THE COMMUNITIES OVERLAP 
VL-sollesne 2783.89 2787.27 s0001 THUS FAR THE MOST EDGES RIGHT SO SORT OF IF YOU PLAY 
VL-sollesne 2787.28 2789.89 s0001 BASKETBALL AND SQUASHING YOU AT STANFORD 
VL-sollesne 2789.90 2792.80 s0001 THEN YOU'RE MORE LIKE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO KNOW EACH OTHER THAN 
VL-sollesne 2792.80 2796.35 s0001 IF YOU PLAY BASKETBALL AND SOMEBODY ELSE WORKS FOR EXAMPLE 
VL-sollesne 2796.36 2798.46 s0001 RIGHT SO HAVING MORE IN COMMON 
VL-sollesne 2798.46 2801.67 s0001 BUT THIS IS SOCIAL NETWORKS GIVES YOU A MORNINGS 
VL-sollesne 2801.68 2807.51 s0001 SO WHAT LIKE UM BASICALLY THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SAY SO LET ME JUST SORT OF SUMMARISE 
VL-sollesne 2807.52 2810.09 s0001 WHAT WHAT WOULD THE POINT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE TODAY 
VL-sollesne 2810.10 2812.88 s0001 SO THE FIRST ONE WAS WE DID DID YOU FIND THIS 
VL-sollesne 2812.89 2814.82 s0001 THE NETWORK REDO PROFILE PLOT 
VL-sollesne 2814.83 2818.21 s0001 BASICALLY TO BE ABLE TO ANALYSE THE GREEDY STRUCTURE OF THE NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 2818.22 2820.56 s0001 THIS OR THAT IN SMALL NETWORK IS THERE 
VL-sollesne 2820.57 2823.10 s0001 THE THIS PLOT HAS A DOWNWARD SLOPE 
VL-sollesne 2823.11 2829.71 s0001 WHILE FOR LARGE NETWORKS IT STARTS GOING UPWARDS SO BASICALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO OUR GROUP AT LARGE DATA 
VL-sollesne 2829.71 2835.17 s0001 UM AND BASICALLY YOU THAT THE DISCOVERY OR THE CONCLUSION FROM THE SHAPE OF THE PLOT IS THAT 
VL-sollesne 2835.18 2839.05 s0001 NETWORKS HAVE THIS KIND OF CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING RIGHTS OR SORT OF IT'S LIKE 
VL-sollesne 2839.06 2841.31 s0001 CUTTING AN ONION IF YOU LIKE 
VL-sollesne 2841.31 2842.75 s0001 UM SO THAT WAS ONE THING 
VL-sollesne 2842.76 2848.38 s0001 AND THEN THE OTHER THING WE WE LOOKED AT WAS THEN SAYING OKAY BUT WHAT ABOUT COMMUNITY SING PLASTICINE NETWORKS 
VL-sollesne 2848.38 2850.75 s0001 SO WE WENT AND TOOK NETWORKS WHERE 
VL-sollesne 2850.76 2853.55 s0001 CAMP GROUND TRUTH LABELS FOR THE CLASS STATUS 
VL-sollesne 2853.56 2861.39 s0001 THE EMPIRICAL OBSERVATION REMADE WAS THAT THESE TWO CLASS THE SOLAR LAB DO THE PROBABILITY OR OF ON EDGE BERRIES HIGHER 
VL-sollesne 2861.40 2863.81 s0001 THEN IN THE NON OVERLAPPING PARTS OF THE CLUSTER 
VL-sollesne 2863.82 2865.04 s0001 BASED ON THIS V. 
VL-sollesne 2865.05 2868.35 s0001 DEVELOP THESE BY PROTOTYPE MODELS GROUP AFFILIATIONS 
VL-sollesne 2868.36 2870.60 s0001 AND WE WERE ABLE TO FEED A MODEL OF A CAR 
VL-sollesne 2870.61 2873.73 s0001 TO BE ABLE TO UM TO DETECT COMMUNITIES 
VL-sollesne 2873.74 2879.25 s0001 JUST ON AVERAGE THE I. V. OUTPERFORM THE EXISTING METHODS FOR THIRTY TO SIXTY PERCENT 
VL-sollesne 2879.26 2884.41 s0001 ON BUT THEY REALLY NOW THE QUESTION IS SORT OF THE CONCEPT TO MY ORIGINAL QUESTION 
VL-sollesne 2884.42 2886.89 s0001 HOW DOES THE COURT PRETTY FREE STRUCTURE 
VL-sollesne 2886.90 2890.15 s0001 A FEEDBACK TO THE TO THE NETWORK COMMUNITIES 
VL-sollesne 2890.16 2892.08 s0001 I SEE THAT NOW UM 
VL-sollesne 2892.09 2893.25 s0001 HE'S HE'S SORT OF 
VL-sollesne 2893.26 2895.66 s0001 EASY TO SEE RIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT 
VL-sollesne 2895.67 2898.42 s0001 OVERLAP AND THE MORE COMMUNITIES OVERLAP 
VL-sollesne 2898.43 2902.51 s0001 THE THE THE MORE EDGES YOU CARRY THAT PART OF THE NETWORK THEN 
VL-sollesne 2902.52 2904.46 s0001 THIS IS COMPLETELY CONSISTENT 
VL-sollesne 2904.46 2909.85 s0001 UM WE DID THAT RIGHT SO THAT BASICALLY YOU HAVE NETWORKS WHERE THE CORE OF THE NETWORK THERE ARE MANY 
VL-sollesne 2909.86 2911.56 s0001 DIFFERENT OVERLAPPING COMMUNITIES 
VL-sollesne 2911.57 2917.96 s0001 WHILE WHILE IN THE PRETTY THIRTY YOU SORT OF CARE PEOPLE THAT MAYBE BELONG TO ONE OR MAYBE EVEN ZERO COMMUNITIES AND THIS WAY 
VL-sollesne 2917.97 2921.23 s0001 YOU CAN SORT OF FOOD TO MAYBE THIS WOULD SOMEHOW 
VL-sollesne 2921.24 2923.82 s0001 DIFFERENT USE OF NETWORKS IN THE LITERATURE 
VL-sollesne 2923.83 2928.87 s0001 ON THE COMMON GROUND ON SO WE THAT ARE UNDONE AND I'D BE VERY HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS 
VL-sollesne 2928.87 2930.10 s0001 THANKS 
VL-sollesne 2930.10 2930.45 s0001 OH 
VL-sollesne 2930.45 2937.35 s0040 I
