so thanks for the invitation and for everything so um 

the plan for today stock east 

is that we do think about um 

basically how to think about structure of network so this is this is the of the bottom line and then i plan to sort of walk you through a few 

a few different things so 

i will start at the beginning right so the first thing is 

well i get networks right then 

basically there is lots and lots of network of data that can very naturally be presented as networks right so 

social networks are just one example in there are many many other examples where 

where you can take some daytime sort of the most natural way to look at that kind of data east represented does a graph as a set of 

but she says onset and a set of edges 

parks or connections between these nodes right so 

you can look at social networks 

a rich use facebook's and things like that 

you can take a collaboration networks know when you're an older human send you connect to 

to know that if they vote the paper together or if they collaborated together 

you can take networks from cell biology so basically you can take 

proteins or genes 

as nodes and you can add them if they interactive they work together 

to produce um you protein or something right and now you can study how the cell works

 

through the of the by analysing those kinds of networks um 

redmond citation networks is another 

are another are another example of a very 

simple case of networks right and then 

a computer networks basically the internet how computers talk to one another 

and communication networks those are all again 

kinds of data data that connect naturally be presented does get us 

right so this is basically 

the data will be working with 

and then the next question nice 

if you're a scientist rightist holidays

 

grass organised right so what kind of structure spectrums do i seen these guys right 

and ah 

usually when we plot networks 

at this in our mind we have to just like be simply just like that right so 

really what i would like to dive into two days 

how should they think about structure of this large networks and what kind of sort of mental images should i care for myself somewhat in the back of my brain 

right on 

so this is basically what i what i want to talk about and 

the level of organization of these networks that i want to talk about 

it's called the level of communities right so really 

the way we we think of networks is that we say that

 

um nodes in these networks maybe humans people are organising to this kind of tightly connected clusters right so for example 

this is a set of 

this is a network where every node is a scientist and connection started 

people who worked or published together 

and like you see in this network the better sort of these clumps of nodes 

that stand to work 

the ten to work together and maybe these clumps correspond 

although researchers seen a particular sub area 

or maybe these are all the researcher 

researchers coming from the same university and so on

 

and also in like social networks 

you expect to see this kind of community sort climb sort of groups of nodes right 

and um there are many other cases where a disk 

communities naturally arise right 

on the web if you think of the web was a graph so web pages and hyperlinks 

community school corresponds to populate that sets of pages 

or for example if you take citation networks 

then sort of 

if you'd you would do community detection is citation networks the communities would probably corresponds to save defeat sub discipline sort particular area us 

or particular peaks where people like to cite each other 

ah in for example on the web this is a very sort of a very 

in some sense famous picture so 

every note here is a blog 

and um 

the connections between the blog represents each blog tend to stance to cite each other blog

 

and on it and then blot afford a republican and democrats and sort of what you find here is that you can be sort of very nicely 

you know the the the democrat the democratic part of the blogosphere and anybody can part of the blogosphere net already few 

connections across right so 

now we have one community and the other community so basically the idea is that the network structure

 

or that any t. v. or something 

about what is the underlying singing the network on what i have here is another collaboration at what this is 

all the people from a santa fe institute 

and again you sort of see these tightly connected class status 

and each cluster corresponds to a cent 

if you then go and see 

and examine what are the people corresponding to that cluster 

you see that they sort of work and different topical areas 

um maybe from computer science point of motivation

 

here's another another view of why 

why you may want to be interested in communities 

so what i'm showing you here is a 

what is called an adjacent semantics right so i have notes here and nodes that and i have a daughter whatever there is an edge between these snow than that node 

right and and what i've done noting my network now i can advertisers 

and these are the communities they be done right so basically in web search 

you have the ads 

and uh particular advertiser can be done uh particular community so the idea is that 

whenever somebody searchers 

for the line here 

all these guys will compete to have the ads displayed neck next to that 

right and now the idea is if you now go in search for 

plasticine this kind of network 

then you would find structures like this and

 

maybe what you would find is that all these advertisers 

tends to be on a common set of creation if you would look at 

examine like this bizarre 

it's done now the police committee set about gambling 

and you know this 

some part of them out of bouts of sports betting and so on 

right so again 

what i want to say is 

we communities a toffee 

right so so now if i want to think about this class the sea networks 

the question is how how do i go and how do i find them right so the way

 

the way we mentally picture this kind of the structure of net was a calf blasters 

here i'm showing you three examples from the literature right so there's that 

sort of the the version one point zero right so using that you can't 

you have the city clusters your cab 

you have no aging these clusters there are lots of connections between the members of the cluster 

and a few connections pointing outside the cluster right 

and now if you sort of get a bit fancier 

you you arrive to this picture 

well now again i sort of have three clusters 

but each of these 

phoebe cluster sort of care 

um some sub clusters right so sort of like having a hierarchy of clusters 

and if i even get fancier 

then i arrive to the pictures like this when i say that now 

gloucester skin even overlap 

so maybe he said nodes 

i had a maybe in a social network these are people that belong to move people community sort of people clusters 

right so this is 

one one 

image that we have in our mind when thinking about networks 

and the other teenager i want to contras be seen this talk

 

is the following each actually that is out when you look at large networks 

they look like they sort of they look like an 

onion or are they can be so 

called they call it a court pretty thirty structural because he thought 

jellyfish structure or out octopus structure right so these are all 

a technical terms dirty foot pool structures like this right sort of that that sort of that you're 

network is composed of this 

concentric circles not get bands and answered 

and they really don't know plasticine here right it sort of justice 

man is that there's there's that and then to think of like 

you've got an onion across 

right so in it

 

what my talk of 

today will be about will be 

how do you reconcile 

this picture and that picture 

right so 

if my networks look like these then they cannot look like that and if they look like these then they 

cannot look like that so 

how can how should i think about clusters so that 

these two pictures come together so this is really

 

um what i want to talk about today is 

how do you sort of put these two seemingly 

different loose about the structure of the networks of together 

okay and um what they want to do for the rest of the talk is 

i want to first focus on this side of the picture and she and sort of show you 

how you arrived 

to the conclusion that large networks have this kind of structure 

and then i want to make a step back and actually start talking about communities 

and bring the two 

features 

so that's 

that's basically um 

what that one 

to talk about 

ah so the first thing 

but i want to talk about this 

how do i have to use 

this notion that networks have this kind of

 

oh cool pretty thirty structure read sort of have these densely connected court 

and in this sparsely connected briefly 

and the way we think about this is basically would say okay 

how could i quantify how well does the network organise into clusters 

and then sort of a next step will be to say okay what kind of computational experiment 

could i design 

that would be really something useful about organisational snap kicks 

right and the idea will be 

so i came to kiribati basically was approximation of items 

to do 

instead of antique a graph petitioning problems 

sort of a some kind of experimental probes in the um structure of our networks so 

i made this more precise 

so any the way we think about this is the following day we say if he sees 

if you think of networks like these

 

then women say let's go and try to identify cluster c. networks and maybe not just trying to identify them but let's try to measure 

how well are discussed as expressed in networks right 

and then we will design 

i measured that tell me how well are the clusters expressed and maybe learn something from that measure right 

and i'm not if i want to go on a search for this class this 

a working definition of discussed this is basically that 

i want to find sets of laws that have lots of connections 

between the members of the set and a few connections pointing goats outside the set right sort of this kind of intuition 

and then the set of laws that have this kind of property 

i call them 

community so i called them cluster sort of groups or

 

modules solar i give them something 

right so in it 

on that is that has been the whole sinking taking the sting out 

holly at least this intuition 

and how do you sort of 

of those four meters into some kind of 

i'll gaudy them or something that again to go and find 

this sets of nodes that have this kind of problem 

right on 

and i will touch on a few of these 

so on any my question to be 

you know is this the right way to think about 

of the structure of catholics

 

okay so hideous candies the can sort of the 

if you have ever seen a single social network then you must have seen this one right 

so this is the the um the it's called zachary scott the club network so the idea was that 

there was a was a critique was appears used to them 

he was studying social dicey narcotic lab 

and during the history of this crowded lobby the university there was a 

there was a conflict and this the clock split into two clubs 

and then one club formed around the 

the um the the the the the instructor of the previous club 

and another pub formed around one of one of its members write an auto show you here is 

a or the square is formed the second club and all the circle in circles formed another club rights or the beginning this was

 

one got the club and then the people speak 

and circus went to form one 

and the squares went to form another one and now if you say given just the network structure could i sort of reconstruct 

in some sense predict 

whether people will go with the circus or whether they're in this uh decided to go to the square club 

the the way 

the way to find these division 

ease by basically trying to split the network 

into two equally sized hops

 

sargent then is the smallest number of edges crossing these bond right 

so this is basically one intuition why 

searching for 

sexist loads of have lots of connections between them and listen very few connections 

pointing across would find you sort of clusters that corresponds to something or yield from your life 

right so uh beds basically the the basically grecian why searching for designated sets of nodes might be useful 

so now going back to what we want to do right so we would like to 

design a measured or something that is say how 

community like is a set of nodes right so how would of a community is a set of notes right so now i will take a set of nodes s. 

and my intuition he still to say hi 

good communities have many edges between the members of the set them through i just pointing outside 

right so nicely dear examples of two sets 

so that i have my set s. and below i am i sent this prime and i ask you 

which is that each of these stories of better communities what community like 

i think it would all 

sort of decide that this is a better community why 

because it has more edges between the member state has fewer edges

 

pointing outside then my then my doing community of that 

right so one way to formalise this you grecian 

into on on objective functional in some kind of far 

hermetic 

is a is the notion that comes from a theoretical computer science it's called conductors 

and they all the conductors nazis the following the test 

how many i just point 

a outside the separate these are all the edges where 

one endpoint easy to set in the other and point is outside the set 

so in in this case i have to i just pointing outside 

and ah 

below i just take the some of the degrees of all the nodes inside this so 

the way you can think about this study is just to say

 

how many edges way have inside my set s. right and i take this a shock 

the smaller the ratio the better the community right so 

um the the conductors offset this prime 

smaller than conduct tinsel set s. 

okay so that's the first thing we we we need to have its 

basically the simplest 

um formally station 

all of this intuition that i that i started meat of all along

 

okay so now now i have the first thing 

so now what i want to do is i want to say 

i want to define a new quantity that i would call it a network community profile 

and the way i mean define this quantities the following 

i was saying that 

ah i really find this a piece of profile that to basically try to say 

for every ace cluster size how well at it 

clusters of that particular size expressed how community life i process of a particular size 

so the way i will do this is the following i would say 

i will say the following so i have something that is a search function of k. k.'s the size of the cluster 

and then i just say i would go or what all subsets of my 

of my network the subsets ice has to be 

equal to k. and i will take the class third that has the best quality right so for every cluster size 

i will go find the best cluster and i remembered that okay 

and then what i do is i would just create a spot 

well here is a the log the tedium of the cost of size k. 

and here is the conductors of the best cluster right so i find the best last so 

the way you can think of 

about doing this is the idea is the following right maybe i six cake was five 

i'd go search or what all possible subsets 

of sci spies 

i find the best one any that gives me a dog right and then i say okay what that what is the best last of size salmon 

katie's these gives me a doctor right and 

i do this what every possible okay 

um 

right this would be maybe the best cluster of sci stand 

okay but here 

i do this for all possible case and i get 

i get a life 

okay so really 

and this is what it'd be looking got so all this is going into it is to say

 

i have i have class the size here and used as me 

how will what is the score to what is the quality of best cluster 

of that particular size 

okay on 

and any sort of the technical question about 

how do i compute this profile plot 

the problem is 

that i can't researcher would all possible subsets right so i'd 

i cannot do that right in the really the way the way i we do in computer scene 

in fact this is to use 

approximation uh got it comes to get up graph petitioning so basically use community detection methods and 

um computer science has developed 

a lot of um 

a different approaches to finding plus the sea networks and all these approaches sort of give you give you some sense probably good results 

but they also have um 

some problems so we need the way we really do need to compute this impact this 

is this is that 

we will take a particular um 

sort of take a community detection method 

we will find all the cluster seen the network 

for every class to be to review 

every custom now here will be a particular bought so maybe i take imagine that they take my

 

but at community action mess that i find all the clusters 

every cluster of 

he represents about that i'd this is the size of the class that this is the score of that cluster 

and all i do then use i find the low what envelope 

off of of this plot right so 

i would go and i would connect the millions of whatever every possible k. 

and this gives me my mike 

okay so 

this is intuitively what we are computing so 

what i want to tell you now is

 

what can i learn from the shape of this curve 

so everything good so far 

any any questions 

okay so we know what we are computing then how we are computing 

so now what 

as i said what i want to ask is 

how does the shape these blue blue line what does it tell me about the structure of my networks 

so um first i show you a few examples to build some intuition so 

imagine that i'm taking 

um let me see so basically like a

 

a good deeds order cubes waterloo chains right so imagine that i take a grab that is a good 

and um if i if i compute 

um if i take these big grass and i ask 

what is a nice 

try to find clusters seen these graph right back to god these graphs 

i can ask what is the size of the cluster 

what is cis of conduct insanity 

conductors is measuring nothing as a sort of surface to volume ratio right so if i'm

 

plotting this on a logarithmic scales 

then for example for a chain 

i get i get us this line to be downward sloping read a slope one 

because basically if i have a long chain i always need to cut one edge 

to get a cluster of how many how many nodes whatever size i want bright so 

so my conduct and she's always one all would 

the number of notes times to inside the cluster right so this will go down 

in the green right 

if i want to cut the clustering agreed 

i need to cut sort of 

the perimeter of the greed 

and i get square 

the number of nodes inside right so this is why 

this has a slope of one hop 

right and if i take a very bands and on graph 

then then the slope of this plot to deflect 

right so 

um this is one one intuition so the intuition can is basically fighting some graph 

and i compute my magic block 

then depending in some sense on the dimensionality of that object that i'm cutting

 

i will have the downward sloping line 

with a different slope 

right so we find for example taking a cube 

like a good often cutting that i get us locals once it 

and for example if i take 

audio network for example i take a network before the californian roads 

and i compute my plot 

i will get a downward sloping plot 

whether the slope is around one hop right 

which basically says that 

world networks 

i like a good it's friday look like these blue line here

 

right so that's the first piece of invention 

um the second piece of information is that actually fight go think somebody oh what of networks for example 

he's he's the network that i showed you this is the 

the people that work of the research on network 

if i compute my 

my my community said i compute my my community profile 

kiddies the size of the

 

of the community buses the score 

you again see that it's downward sloping 

and you see for example that this particular deep here 

corresponds to the community that i labelled read a right so disgusted 

corresponds to these deep here 

the class to be corresponds here if i combined see any together 

i get a i get that point here so 

but what i want to say is again i see the stink of sophie downwards 

and so really 

what what should we what we know so far if i sort of summarise and make a hypothesis right so what we know so far

 

for the two examples that they did there is that 

basically this this network and really profile that i showed you sort of slopes downwards right 

sort of has this kind of 

down what shape 

and a base in this example that i gave you 

a from a chain single leads and things like that 

the this bill or this the speed at which this is sort of descending 

which tell me something about the the originality of my network right 

you know that in a soft sense 

so in the question is what happens if i 

it's sort of if i think 

my networks and a might i take real networks that allowed right so the example i showed you before had like two hundred three hundred nodes 

what happens if i take grabs that have bigger size 

so what we did is we took 

basically live two hundred different large networks with a large means everything this has more than ten thousand nodes 

and i think the largest we too could like ten million that's right 

and the question is how does the shape of this plot look there 

and he's a he's a sort of small example that we were still able to do so 

and this is the network

 

visualization of the network and this is the applaud that i define before right so plasticizer versus quality lower is better 

of was a surprise the surprise is that these goes down and then goes up 

ah and the other thing that sort of a 

oh corresponds to to go to the picture that is this is now the visualization 

i think we did it 

ah yes you buy it 

ah of that network and what you see right is that sort of there is no 

no little got no good class that's actually if you're on your community detection method 

and then blocked 

the clusters for example the community addiction method will tell you that with his remote corners along along cluster

 

and all that and notes of them belong to another cluster 

and all these green old scores belong to some other 

green cluster that i that i've labeled there 

right so sort of 

something something funny is going on right in this network is not that big because only 

four thousand nodes in ten thousand edges fifteen thousand pages 

right so easy to show you that 

this kind of down and up shape 

ease of use common here and different examples so right so this is the

 

live journal network a social networking seven million people 

these are all the germans that they're using microsoft instant messenger 

again couple of million people 

this is the bypass pipe network of or service to papers 

uh so scientific papers a disease citation network from high energy physics 

part of the web graph 

and this is the amazon of products co purchasing network so every note is a is a a product

 

and you connect nodes of death go put just together okay 

uh the black line a good question so the black line 

ease the community profile 

of the random graph conditions on the same degree distribution 

right so a decent black line tells me what if i would beg the ground because the same number of notes the same number of fair just and every edge has the same number of connections 

but these connections go and them 

and you see 

but basically i lose all the structure i see no class this whatsoever 

so it's it's like comparing to the baseline but for now it doesn't really matter 

it says that 

networks are not and because 

these networks would be random 

i would be of them but i'm down here so i have 

more structure i have better start bit more structure or more clusters than what i would expect 

the world would be sort of them 

but sort of it doesn't really matter for what i want to pay 

okay so 

uh going back so 

just to show you 

of my live journal example right the thing goes down and goes up

 

so the question basically call should i understand he's right what the way i should 

early this is to say that 

us us classed as go between you know from small size to let's around a hundred 

they get better and better 

right so the the saying goes down 

but then at some size right 

and my class this started getting worse and worse right sort of if i want the cluster on thousand miles 

it's actually has very bad quality has was quality than something 

of a small size 

so really now the question is why does this tell me about the structure of the networks 

and the first thing is 

what kind of the question is how do i 

what how do i explain the upward going body and the way to extend upward growth going part

 

is to think of networks as a heavy here so here i have a big three 

and these three like continues down to a you know to the ground and so on 

and the way to think about this is to say 

ah that sort of if you cavity where every node 

because um 

let it twice as many children as it 

ozzie ozzie it's that bad and does 

then you get you will get the upward sloping 

community profile why is that 

because first you will say okay this is the best community i can get right 

i got one edge 

and i get seven oh so we fly some of the degrees 

i get a seven edges inside so 

ah you know here's my conduct that's now i want the bigger cluster so 

the way i get a bigger cluster is to cut here right now i have to cut way i just

 

to get one additional edge inside 

right so again i'm getting worse not if i want to make even a bigger cluster 

right i would have to cut even more than just to get 

basically to get this to these two edges of above things inside my cluster right so basically 

the bigger class that i want 

the water seed gets right so this is sort of a pie example 

that says that as i'm trying to get bigger clusters 

basically more and more edges i have to cut so my class this basically get worse and worse 

um so that's the first part 

the second part is how do i explain these downward by the green part 

and it and basically hearing

 

it empirically result 

but basically you have lots of these 

very little 

a thesis 

but that are that are connected to just a few edges to the rest of the network 

right um 

and basically this or anything as you that your networks 

have some kind of courtly thirty structure right i have this 

little clusters on the periphery the decks to around one hundred 

nodes large 

but i can easily cut away and they get sort of better embedded as i

 

as i can use the size but one sort of i get beyond these critical cluster size 

i have to go start cutting into these then score 

and my clusters get worse and worse 

right so this is this is the first sort of the first conclusion 

a bit of the qualities needed pieces we call them this cares okay 

so why am i telling you this because i can do the following 

i can take my network 

identify my whiskers 

and then you remove them so i can say what is the 

what is the community profile of the food network 

versus was a community profile of the core of the network only 

and what i'm showing you here 

is the green is the

 

is of the committee profile of only the quarter 

and read these of the food network on 

so what do you see 

basically you see that very little happens right my record of 

just she's that upwards 

and um um to the right of so basically this means that 

but even whatever is left 

because very similar structure 

to the to do regional network right so really what happened was that my class that has got a bit worse even though

 

i removed all the green parts out of the network 

so any one used as is now that i have a court briefly structure 

and these corporate infrastructure is actually mastered the right so that the score 

also has a bar layout of pretty pretty and another layer of court 

okay so that's what i can conclude from aicha what i can conclude all of these 

so just to summarise what what what do these experiments suggests

 

so this experience of jazz that's when i'd 

look at net was a calf couple of thousands of nodes 

the way i i should think about the structure something is something like this right sort of i have this 

can concentric circles that all smells of good then as more and more densely connected 

and then if i want to get 

good clusters what i do is basically i cut away distinctly scripps right so 

you know that this little pieces that are very easy to cut away and these are 

these are good small clusters but then 

when i want to start to find the clusters 

i have to start cutting deeper and deeper into the 

court off my network 

and these clusters get worse and worse 

and just on 

empirically it turns out that 

ah ah sixty percent of the nodes and eighty percent of the edges 

um sort of fighting the core of the network 

and the rest easy that these of first layer of the briefly 

and this also sort of explains 

many experiments with people take a large network 

do the clustering 

and then they find one big cluster 

but these about cough of the size of the network and they call disgusted miscellaneous 

and then they find all the other small and then the that but for the small clusters right so basically

 

they find the core 

and then they find all the little small pieces okay 

so this is what i wanted to say 

about the structure of the networks and sort of different community school use this kind of structure of different right so 

the court it nest that could produce a structure 

a computer networks community quoted jellyfish structure 

mathematicians call it the octopus texture 

but at the end is basically the same sort of some kind of body with some kind of tentacles of

 

speaking go 

so with these i hope i convinced you or show you demonstrated that networks have 

this kind of structure 

so what i want to do now for the for the next twenty minutes 

is to focus on this part of the picture 

okay so now i want to go back and start actually say oh but you know 

ideally i was really telling you how 

how classless existing those networks and now for twenty minutes i was convincing you 

that there are no plastics right so sort of i have to decide what they want to bed so 

i'll go there and i'll i'll tell you about communities 

so arm 

here is the way how we usually do community detection right 

so the way we do it is the following we go we take some data set maybe i take 

for those who who quite familiar with networks i conveyed the d. v. l. p. dataset so these are 

or the computer science article speaking much ever published right so every node 

now who are out of this data alright so out of this computer science of publication data 

i can be presented as a graph i can represent it does a collaboration network right so every node is a scientist 

and i connect to sign t. c. b. wrote a a paper together right so 

i know me and monica would be connected because we have a joint paper together

 

so now okay i am a graph and now i could take my favourite comedian addiction matter 

and i would go to detect 

class the sort of communities right 

and then what what is the next step i do 

i go i examine discussed this and i sort of try to 

even to read them as i recall that was sort of video communities right i maybe go and say 

oh i discover the bayes 

on the amazing based on the network structure identify clusters 

but then i figured out that all these nodes may be working the same area 

and all these three notes you know 

a publishing the same journal or come from the same university of 

have something else in common 

but i don't observe 

um internet 

right so basic um just drink 

normal class thing right 

so on 

what we need in the following thing is the following gripe is to say 

can i use this is the typical pipeline people who 

this can i go can i find data sets that actually i have some kind of notion of ground truth 

could i sort of

 

have data sets when i know what the clusters of i'm looking for are 

right and here is basically the idea right so so 

is the idea was to go and try to find 

networks where 

there is an explicit notion of ground truth right so if i go back to my 

collaborations example 

right so maybe i would 

proxy for the ground truth community see global collaboration networks

 

could be conference a sojourn strike you would think that 

if i take a collaboration at work 

community seen a collaboration network would risk corresponds to saint if it basically is a sub disciplines 

and sandy pit scientific disciplines have their own jonas so maybe a good 

proxy for a scientific community 

these are all the people that publishing the same job 

and actually we have the data you know where the papers were published right 

is social networks 

people um 

create and joining of two groups right so on facebook you can create a group and your friends can join on many other social networks you can create groups right so again this can be 

a notion of ground truth clusters and 

um for example in information networks that's another example we we look up 

is basically you have people that sort of 

created it this topic the cohesion of or 

groups based on topics 

so really the idea i use 

but i have networks 

maybe like this 

and they know that 

that is me what community or what group it belongs end 

in this case i just drew the the way the example in such a way that every node belongs to a single community 

but of course you can be long commute people groups 

right and the data said that we were able to find the cab 

well these data is available or are up here right away that you have 

on social networks 

a collaboration network and some

 

and ah amazon progress commendation network 

a number of notes number offenders 

this is the number of plaster so number of ground truth groups 

but i see a s. is that every size of the group and eighties 

the average number of groups i'm not a node belongs right so in some 

in some of these some networks a uh no belong scoop and so groups while 

in other in other networks nodes don't tell us what group they belong okay 

but this is basically read we restart so what we have now 

is i have a network 

and for every node

 

i sort of know what group it belongs to what clustered along school 

okay so if i had this kind of a top 

what can i do 

so there are two important things that i can read 

so the first thing is i can actually stand going insane 

right before i was telling you a group is a set of snow that has lots of connections 

um between the member since you pointing outside right

 

now i can think is grounded groups and say old lady has that property right is this city the property that i should be looking for 

in my networks if i want to identify discussed 

so really the question is i can take you study 

how these groups met on the top of the network 

and this will give me insight altitudes design better community detection algorithms 

on the second thing that's also important is that 

now i can do that 

sort of proper evaluation methods right i can sort of 

start computing do curiously of my

 

or might clustering were my community detection of god 

what i mean by that is that i can make my 

my empty network 

like so i like a bit of that 

i do my 

my community detection method and now i can say 

how well does for example this community 

correspond to a you know do this or this clusters or this know that i do that but i identify belong pokemon here 

we really belong to the same community right 

maybe i hear you see i i was able to buy my method identified this community correctly 

but it totally screwed up in this part of the network right so now i can 

measure 

and a curious you're my matter 

right so this is basically what i can do and i'll give you 

examples of both of these are cases 

right so if i now want to study color this video groups

 

map on the on the on the top of the network 

he's the most simple question you can ask you can say 

i have two notes from 

they share a k. groups so they they belong to k. group they have k. groups in common 

what is the probability that 

you are un t. v. beating 

linked as a number of other groups they have in common 

okay sort of super simple question 

so the way people thought about this is the following right so

 

so the first you off network community detection which is 

the intuition i was sending you all along about 

finding sets of nodes eat lots of connections between the members of the outside 

then you that 

um you know 

you don't you are not connected basically you only belong to a single group so this question doesn't even apply so that the mental picture of the network of having your head is something like that 

then the next thing is to say okay what is my group's overlap in the way 

people think about overlapping groups today 

is basically something clyde is basically they say that there are these nodes 

that and ones that belong to multiple groups but he's dead now that basically 

they don't need to one another so the assumption is that the probability of financial decreases 

as a as a as an um as the number of common groups increases between the two people 

right it's a tough 

um maybe doesn't make too much sense 

so what you can actually do is 

given that we have these ground truth i can go and measure these right so what i have here is

 

of what every better for miles i ask 

how many groups 

do you have in common right how many common groups grew belong to 

versus was a probability of a net right 

and of the thing goes up 

so really what does this tell me 

right so that this this thing this tells me is the following right is it does mean that 

the more groups we have in common the more likely what the art of to be connected

 

right which basically means that 

the 

the more communities overlap in in a particular part of the network 

the more and just are there in that part of the network 

right so just to give you a little picture right 

so the way the way i can think about this is the following great so carry have 

a city to example networks in here i have the corresponding adjacent sea maybe she's right so 

knowns nodes 

a empty space means there's no edge of bought means there is a net right 

so really 

if i buy 

if i think of network communities uh some kind of graph petitioning problem 

then i'm making an assumption that my 

adjacent sea matrix looks like this right i have a cluster lots of connections another plaster 

and a few connections between the two clusters 

if i buy 

for example or if i 

my picture my notion of network communities 

these these of sort of finding articulation points which is which is what 

um click click relation method does and so on 

in in what the way i think of our jesse maybe she's the following right ocampo clusters they overlap

 

but the overlap is 

less well connected than 

each of the two non overlapping parts of the last strike 

and sort of what happens the intuition that comes from the plot in the previous slide is the following right is 

if i have to communities that overlap 

then i can the most at justin over there 

right so any my point is that 

the world is not like that 

but it's like this 

and now the question is 

how can a goal detect communities might look how can i go to tech clusters

 

if these classes have such a structure 

right because 

methods the bayes 

but the bayes and easy bring in that intuition or this intuition 

with fail in this case 

so the question is 

on how wasted going to tech clusters 

so the way i really do this is the following 

i will i will basically do 

like a model based community detection so i will show you 

a very simple model hollow networks can be generated

 

and then we will feed that model back to the data 

right so my money is very simple it is a 

basically um what i call my record my model a 

community affiliation graph model so 

the verse structure is very simple 

so the bottom line out of my notes of the network 

ah the the top are my communities 

on all these connected to the communities it belongs to 

so all the nodes belong to the community a

 

or the blue notes belong to the community be 

and all of the word and knows they belong to both communities right 

so very simple so 

what it says is 

now i have um are now i have my notes of the social network at the bottom 

i have communities on the top 

and i just mean memberships 

so now the question is 

given these kind of 

a graph how do i generate the social network 

the way i regenerate the social network is very simple 

for every pair of nodes 

i will just say 

of and for every community that they have in common 

i mean sweep a coin 

and need that particular probability that they have a bad 

the corn you do manage 

so on 

yeah and of course now it's any 

easy to see that 

if if i have 

if these two nodes have 

communities in common 

they get to sleep one coin

 

and to get to sleep another quite right so the more communities we have in common the more than one quite as we get to sleep 

the more likely we will have a marriage 

a between us 

so many naturally models 

of the plot that i showed you before sort of that 

better mortgage assisi share more communities right so here's the farmer at the probability of financial simply 

um of i go at all the communities we have in common 

this is the probability that the that do not base again this is a problem that none of these coin flip succeeds like if at least one of them succeeds we create an edge 

between are my notes of this ocean 

right so now 

what i can do is i have a model of how networks can be generated 

um what is cute is actually that that 

this you can automatically analyse this model 

and for example prove that you can get follow the distributions and all of them 

other nice things 

but that sort of not important for us what is important for us is that 

we have this model of networks

 

but despite amortized by by these parameters try to have my work except so my notes of the social network 

okay my communities visegrad nodes 

i have my membership and just 

and i have these parameters that danny how like the article notes to be connected is they belong to that particular common community 

right so what they can do now is 

i can do the following thing right so what i'm showing you so far less to say if i if i do this kind of by paragraph

 

you know how to generate the network right 

for every a pair of notes here you flip a coin and you connect them there 

what i can also do is i can go the other way i can say 

uh given the network figured out 

of the model right so figure out these by but i've got 

um so what do i mean by figure out the graph 

figure out 

uh the structure of this network 

figure out the number of communities so the number of square miles 

and the figure out the parameters use a barometer speak of that right 

um and again 

the thing is that ah you can go into a 

the way we do that is on 

is very sort of it's a relatively simple 

so it's a symbol maximum likelihood um 

estimation problem right i'm just saying 

um given my graph 

what is the most likely 

a model that he's got his urge even argued that that could have generated my video that up

 

and um 

the way i saw this at the end 

is basically i'd i'm doing some kind of coordinate coordinate the sand 

when in the first step i'm sort of 

it's changing the structure of my grass 

any the second step 

i'm a fixing my graph and i'm figuring out what this platonic this linking probability should be a night of a repeat is a long enough and sort of i converge and find a good good

 

okay so 

ah this is a this is the point in being here is that actually if you do this 

on synthetic they dine measure how well are you doing 

and it sort of works well in practise 

but what's important now is the following right is that i can think of the graph 

my social network and i can figure out 

my community affiliation go right i can figure out for every node 

what community she belongs to doesn't even 

given a graph like that 

and then the other thing i can do i can also go back and say

 

now i when i see that the model to that i really discovered communities because i i i disk i decided to teach nodes belong to what communities so now i can go and start comparing 

my ah my inflate community swede idiot communities so what i mean by that is right i can take my network 

might be scarless correspond dirty own group memberships 

and maybe these um 

um the circus or the set

 

sets indicate that you put community memberships right now i can say you know how well how anybody discovered these colors 

but based solely on the network structure 

and then a few measure measure sort methods that already standard in computer science 

to evaluate a this kind of a 

of problems right so there is the escort of the s. one score the precision and recall 

you can measure the mutual information 

we do the discovered community centre to communities 

would you can quantify something that is called all my index 

and then for comparison 

i will show you how to compare and my method right so what is my method given a network i want to find the parameters of this model which basically means that i 

i found the group memberships and now i will compare how rude groups i find 

this is the two standard methods 

one is called click population 

and the other one was just published 

it's called link clustering so involved this mask methods find groups that over the right sort of 

they allowed notes to belong to move people groups 

and if you don our master 

a case hallway leads drink

 

ah these ah so i have different data sets 

difference course higher is better 

what i'm showing you is a relative improvement 

of our method over in this case the link clustering right on 

and what you see is that here for example 

the other we do seventy times better in 

deciding how many community side bending the network 

and we also do better in terms of their scorn or migraine x. 

but it and so future information we do a bit worse so this is falling clustering 

and this is the results for the click click relation 

um and again sort of the detect communities that corresponded real ones 

much better than the population

 

um the other thing i wanted to show 

he's also so another way how you can look at the d. c.'s just sort of to say can use the performance automatically corporation 

this is the performance of the other of our team effort 

ah for the city different um 

a performance metrics 

if in the bodies of a that they're gonna be better if it's below their growth 

the competition does better 

um he it snowed is no doubt that sort of we do better than in custody 

for quick regulation actually also too much but like 

so this is just a visual way to look at the previous table 

that sort of a a tall sizing up all sort of quality ranges 

of you find better tasks 

um so just to give you maybe a small example of of how how you find clusters

 

so what is this is is a is ego network of one of my students so this is a 

ah one of my korean students who took 

or he's a facebook friends and then tied to a labelled a good living two different groups and he he he decided he he has four groups of his fancy care sort of 

france from his career in high school 

ah ah ah ah france from his workplace basically everywhere he did an internship and then he cares

 

two sets of stanford friends 

one with whom he play squash 

and the other one arm he's sort of of basketball friends and um 

a what i show you here is 

and every 

is the communities our method was able to identify 

for example these are no that don't belong to any for any of the groups that are were 

we decided not to classify 

and the open circles side of the are the mistakes right so 

for circus are the certain are good knows where we made the correct guess 

and the da da empty circus are the mistakes but what i want to show you here is basically that 

the place where the communities overlap 

thus far the most edges right so sort of if you play 

basketball and squashing you at stanford 

then you're more like much more likely to know each other than 

if you play basketball and somebody else works for example 

right so having more in common 

but this is social networks gives you a mornings

 

so what like um basically this is what i wanted to say so let me just sort of summarise 

what what would the point that i wanted to make today 

so the first one was we did did you find this 

the network redo profile plot 

basically to be able to analyse the greedy structure of the networks 

this or that in small network is there 

the this plot has a downward slope 

while for large networks it starts going upwards so basically it's important to our group at large data

 

um and basically you that the discovery or the conclusion from the shape of the plot is that 

networks have this kind of corporate restructuring rights or sort of it's like 

cutting an onion if you like 

um so that was one thing 

and then the other thing we we looked at was then saying okay but what about community sing plasticine networks 

so we went and took networks where 

camp ground truth labels for the class status 

the empirical observation remade was that these two class the solar lab do the probability or of on edge berries higher 

then in the non overlapping parts of the cluster 

based on this v. 

develop these by prototype models group affiliations 

and we were able to feed a model of a car 

to be able to um to detect communities 

just on average the i. v. outperform the existing methods for thirty to sixty percent 

on but they really now the question is sort of the concept to my original question 

how does the court pretty free structure

 

a feedback to the to the network communities 

i see that now um 

he's he's sort of 

easy to see right so if you have communities that 

overlap and the more communities overlap 

the the the more edges you carry that part of the network then 

this is completely consistent 

um we did that right so that basically you have networks where the core of the network there are many 

different overlapping communities 

while while in the pretty thirty you sort of care people that maybe belong to one or maybe even zero communities and this way
