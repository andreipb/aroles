Slide 8
How network organize into clusters? What computational experiment should we  design reveal network organization?      Idea: Use approximation algorithms for the  NP-hard graph partitioning problems as experimental probes of the network structure 9 
---------
Slide 9
Communities: Working definition: Sets  of nodes with lots of links inside the set and  few to the outside  (the rest of the network) Industry: Develop methods that extract such  - sets of nodes 10 Communities, clusters, groups, modules

Communities: Working definition: Sets  of nodes with lots of links inside the set and  few to the outside  (the rest of the network) Industry: Develop methods that extract such  - sets of nodes 11 Communities, clusters, groups, modules Question: Are large networks really like this?

How -is a set of nodes? A good cluster S has Many edges internally Few edges pointing outside Simplest objective function:  Conductance    Small conductance corresponds to good clusters   13 S

Computing                                  is intractable! Use approx. algorithms to graph partitioning Spectral (quadratic approx.):  confuses  Multi-commodity flow (log(n) approx.):  difficulty with expanders  SDP log(n)):  best in theory Metis (heuristic): common in practice  Bottom line: they all reveal similar NCP 15

 (k), (score) k, (cluster size) 24 Better and better clusters Clusters get worse and worse  Best cluster has ~100 nodes 
---------
Slide 24
As clusters grow the number of edges inside grows slower that the number crossing 25 =2/10 = 0.2 Each node has twice as many children =1/7=0.14 =8/20 = 0.4 =64/92 = 0.69 
---------
Slide 25
Empirically we note that best clusters are barely connected to the network 26 NCP plot  Core-periphery structure Whisker

Slide 30
Whiskers are responsible for good communities Denser and denser core of the network Core contains 60% node and 80% edges 31

Slide 31
Nested Core-Periphery (jellyfish, octopus) Whiskers are responsible for good communities Denser and denser core of the network Core contains 60% node and 80% edges 32

---------
Slide 33
34 (1) Take a dataset  (2) Represent it as a graph  (3) Identify communities                        (really, clusters)  (4) Interpret clusters as  communities C A B D E H F G C A B D E H F G work in the same area publish in same journals

Slide 34
Networks with a an explicit notion of Ground-Truth: Collaborations: Conferences & Journals as proxies for areas  Social Networks: People join to groups, create lists  Information Networks: Users create topic based groups 35 C A B D E H F G C A B D E H F G work in the same area publish in same journals
