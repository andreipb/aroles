Description
Elementary biological units such as proteins and peptides self-assemble into natural biological nanostructures 
such as protein fibers and amyloid fibrils (AF). Another class of nanomaterials is man-made bioinspired materials, 
which are composed from chemically synthesized biomolecules and can self assemble into nanotubes (PNT), nanospheres, 
hydrogels, etc. AF and PNT are supramolecular ensembles, which are built-up from crystallized subunits highly ordered 
at the nanoscale and possessing unique intrinsic physical properties, such as quantum confined phenomena or asymmetric 
space structure and polar dielectric properties. The Lecture will be focused on basic physical properties of biological 
and bioinspired nanostructures, development of novel generation of bioinspired nanomaterials and their applications in 
nanophotonics, nanomedicine and nanobiopiezotronics.
