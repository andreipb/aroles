is that wasn't 

the literature 

so this this is a well known 

the user 

and as you use the fish in 

because that 

manager of interesting for you 

eh 

and 

i was involved 

biological and by aspire nobody else 

um 

it's in your 

it's in your goals your because doing 

the whole history of mankind twenty 

one is that 

what's going on inside 

inside each side of others 

and out west thinking about 

which you 

that was a long 

the basic conditions 

the biological materials are fabricated 

everything is nature 

in las 

animals 

human body 

and 

they should give up 

the last angel 

where angels 

at any scale 

starting long 

nanoscale i'm not most watches and will speak about quality 

and energy by human 

the key issues like bodily 

and this is where intuitive and i was in 

what's going on of physical wonder you 

in nature 

and that is why 

was the into a five 

mine's five which 

but despite materials 

they are 

let me fall 

canada this is a bio one of those 

see it as it is a book inspiration 

is it ten leaning 

nations develop materials 

and the feature which will speak 

so the whole picture 

is there 

so a seventies 

of creation 

formations 

also biological 

and binds five questions 

so there is 

the knowledge 

bottom up technology 

developed by nature didn't belong to a level those 

starting fall 

fall is ordered 

an ending by 

human beings 

in this case that we are 

a huge yellow system

 

and the universe 

but as they followed not a structural issue 

we all 

it follows 

none of materials in the world 

i agree 

this knowledge euros fall 

or sites 

which started from development in ninety one 

off cover nachos by egypt 

which was used that 

joe would 

managing knowledge 

the lesson is that 

okay 

but despite materials 

i have a biological and binds by both of them 

absolutely yes 

they weren't 

because eh 

absolutely company useful and

 

building blocks 

this was in another wall atoms and molecules 

a lot of 

fall 

terrible 

all elements 

a lot of islam positions 

but anyway 

editor adam 

one of them all 

in biological hole 

with all the way 

two eighty and in los 

i mean less 

and this and this 

it's a self assembly in seoul 

more complicated 

structure 

like that 

forties 

and made us 

but they are considered 

a biological the loss 

again 

so that is the foundation is a basic physical mechanism 

which are all 

not just all 

okay and the buildable 

in by a 

and by five year olds 

are i mean it's enough of these 

the next step 

neckties 

oh stake involved 

for all people 

no nor what is it 

it is 

for this a step a promise 

it is simple 

so all 

by one 

the basis is 

by more 

okay this is biological wall and samples and the reason 

and an addict tool 

for their creations 

that is why 

i would like to start form 

and they all these lit 

well let's think about 

my other occasions 

but despite my tears 

okay again okay this is a level that is why 

they are basically going in itself as it exactly

 

okay 

but i will state council estate and now 

soloist in a is is your generational materials 

two is a good age 

and to the malls and development of these materials 

so in january of occasions 

let me 

describe shortly what is going for the nanoscale in boilers 

adam and building blocks as i said 

their eyes and politics a body which are scuffles 

or biological 

the nanoscale a self assembly 

in tool to all different groups 

i mean 

working five does 

okay a peptide is reach up shirt

 

shows the surface structure of um you know 

i didn't do that in five 

a lot of it is they could be divided into 

absolutely glows 

this almost one is 

nature other words 

that doesn't go to is self assembly into this 

not all 

and in 

mechanism 

a conventional mechanism 

net nacional mechanism off 

formation of these materials 

the filaments 

my little as my actual laws 

well all there because they are 

do they go on and off 

human side mosquito 

they provide 

she is a probabilities 

the eighties skull being 

i was basically and 

eh 

tension 

all of them that this 

images is a images form 

okay into a minute okay they're not a structure which

 

then a rather than not 

not materials which we can say 

singles this or something like this 

look at this all this logic 

on non structure because they're so but no 

i will come there was this on is that because of the basie boy 

for for almost all the major 

but these new generation of materials 

so far more than 

okay 

you can see here this this small 

not to go through them and company they 

couples 

a human bomb quality 

oh well this is did 

this all soul a self assembly in our human being body

 

does does but this then 

and that was in moses is 

is there on a digital non major so so then 

okay i'm does it is that a stage as you can see 

i associated with this 

many 

no no degenerative disease 

okay 

in a house estate 

or yeah states 

yeah age 

u. k. so 

what he is and 

and they're better 

okay 

but when 

and it goes on a human being is idiots 

okay 

you can get finally install a book on what it's worth 

okay from so little to install 

water then 

i will speak about it 

what is the structural where 

lot probably three six also was re 

okay but anyway

 

they have risen 

all 

liz twenty a little a disease 

i don't know 

arkansas 

cabrera many others which are 

which we know that an asian of is you young people 

okay but anyway not working almost one glow in one of these 

shah for 

now europe's 

wow this insight human body which you can see here 

okay 

kill 

analysts 

it's a 

it's an all 

but what we do know that the is 

this is a quote is 

and 

idols they what kinds of self assembly into the same 

other animals 

but well 

little kids these many pictures 

you know what can be done confounded mahler

 

there are a lot of this is there 

brent where and this is the hospital really 

all of these experiments 

of many many people 

you have generated this isn't the only re 

to fly again there is two interviews 

easy teachers 

the other area 

in order to stop the courses also 

okay 

now 

this is my biomaterials east who wish forty five verses human body 

thousands 

when reasons for development all 

all by spider 

we know 

holloway outcome goals 

we don't know the composition of wire

 

i think maybe k. 

i think 

if you're looking for these development 

one we have 

and that year old on a horizontal was 

but 

a signal 

no convictions of these these 

but anyway i went with them 

was great joy because if you're interested in development it's 

it only one reading you start 

absolutely new field 

the boy and the field was done by the daily 

in the united states 

so 

he too 

he took out a native 

number d. i a n. g. o.s 

i will speak about eating details

 

and so i replied 

and suddenly he has got 

oh 

this is not the chips 

when p. m. 

it was this study 

going from engineering 

a lot of 

you know we have to an m. s. it's and shutter speed gives only tool 

and the logic sees 

as you can see it when joe probably more but you should 

change the position of these 

he 

does 

that diet an audience 

billions unlimited 

number 

in to have a ten to twelve 

guide them 

draws us lab around the wealth after the publication started to play disease 

very interesting game 

well 

which is very good granted 

okay i imagine development 

well 

done my clearly 

less than of england is why 

i do my business to protein fibres 

and that is why i do my view from the very beginning to quite different also who

 

thereby inspired materials 

my colleague from a minibus tip of us and gives a call 

and 

i was new to develop 

i will show you 

the method of 

the 

physical position technology of the position 

of these materials 

this she told 

and tried to do 

my love and succeeded to develop 

one of the drugs again 

signs here 

you can see all along please 

star forming alliances 

and it was a long time over the development and finally when he excluded

 

step by step deeper and deeper and i mean 

this is key problem baby on my team 

the only way 

d. even eleven i 

like 

this one this is it 

this is a very simple to i mean s. is 

now i'll n. i. n. f. 

where 

didn't know ellen i'm 

now i think 

the automotive 

this is due reason for formation 

i'm a lawyer i was a guy mean frivolous which killed 

you all remember 

okay 

and he a 

she seemed as i visit 

if it was very simple as i say 

and he found 

but in wonder 

in winter 

they seized no onion doing a few seconds 

can produced 

unlimited number please

 

this depending on that you you can do we 

they said it simply 

you wanna this much you know 

you put in the water suddenly you see 

you have a lot of a lot of damage oops we research okay 

another one 

there are to play number two for medical of no money oriented 

you can get from organic solutions 

they 

simple 

but people on this talk and as i said also 

i've started to develop 

new generation of 

this materials 

by inspire 

to watch 

oh 

first of all of these guys were out by cans a chemists 

that is why 

they thought there'd be cool which support 

by new materials 

maybe stick 

there 

i don't know about this market 

i don't know about right implication if i know i don't know 

many my mentor let's continue 

continue to walk ins is doing 

action 

we will speak about 

ingenuity 

we will speak about the physics okay 

but that's a squishy is 

oh 

i don't know about these materials 

mike wishes 

to my call it what is it 

what is the animal what is it 

inside 

was among mcchrystal's legs what is it 

oh 

and i understood immediately there

 

the 

i could come 

oh 

a lot of this 

examples of a difference also materials 

of those one dark 

these days you know 

adenovirus 

biological 

okay 

the second one i'm i'm a 

i mean if you boil 

okay and the other one produced by good in ninety three 

but in spite of material 

what is there 

come on 

comedy is 

that if you're looking at the x. rayed function 

and then twenty destruction

 

you can find it they are 

vernon from in a 

okay we can recognise that 

no 

and the school actually we care 

every 

action 

you don't know 

that we have there 

now mcchrystal an oddly 

no 

hanukkah is to think of malware 

self 

sam balloon mechanism 

i was simply shock because i 

so 

at the eighties it is that 

they 

good beginning 

little kids is 

you have you have graphic 

you're the city 

but 

because you have

 

none of structure or drink 

mamma structure 

region which 

a subdivided only in between them 

but 

i 

right 

not mcchrystal i'm building block selling the bike 

no longer than two week into actions 

what doesn't mean on call and week 

and i would say dynamic into friction 

you can assembly and that means that probably 

you can do family back 

okay to build them 

books 

and this is 

well known in by 

colleges 

all biology and we 

off all sort of my littlest 

watch 

i live in the starch indomitable wheels 

inside our wet 

berman said 

muscles so on 

they are so political 

so you can east 

it 

you can extract 

any reach 

any element any building laws which 

doesn't like 

to well thought bitterly 

and to change 

probably it is 

nature mechanism of this self assembly 

over movement 

also what we can see to do a 

we are 

if you look in sight 

our brain 

our ability

 

get to see and to smile 

and many other functions 

perfect 

was so 

o. z. 

only nature of all 

could do a king 

but insight we have 

nine the structures 

oh 

this number strategies are 

linked 

you know as you can see here a better 

she is 

going into an election plate 

okay 

think 

between them 

a simple 

very 

a maybe 

find this non governance board 

okay disease 

okay elementary building blocks 

oh 

right now mcchrystal's 

as you can see here 

okay 

and 

i think the body by none column 

bonds 

non coolant 

wonder was hydrogen 

electrostatic that'll that'll many many others 

but but yeah 

very weak a key 

i 

eh 

stress it not in vain 

you will see it that way 

okay 

i found very interesting picture megabyte

 

someone informs to 

university 

very interesting picture you can see 

here 

that you have your death 

the silence 

it is 

beginning of super molecular structure 

you have now mcchrystal intuition 

okay 

violence 

and what is interesting 

and we will see 

later 

all of them have 

the same 

not to mention in i mean do same 

competition two mornings 

again found dead each 

yeah 

he's come pulled for two more lives 

one of my closest said you know

 

prostitute always a a physical we twenty departments in solid state devices 

and i 

teach my students to run norton quantum well lasers 

and then i 

following this picture 

i seen self assemble 

lee 

it's quantum well structure 

well speak about it what this quantum well quantum dots 

okay but anyway 

oh 

it's self assembly itself 

and people 

you are 

involved in development off 

burgess laser structure 

know how 

how we see 

difficult call was problematic how it is expensive 

all for nothing 

self assembly 

the technology developed from from each other 

may i have a name for this or not 

but 

because it's amazing 

this free 

a presented in picture us off 

off a 

biological 

mama people structure 

i'm a liberals 

tied down at europe's better to sit here 

reply 

it's not the fibres but where well 

he's a difference okay 

the 

the basic features can get 

and 

this same 

by more to come 

these are the composition

 

we know how 

using design and again can do it 

that biological advice but 

can get an identical composition okay 

eh 

okay 

then get the same level of the commission itself 

i mean we can his 

okay 

and they are 

so my mother called nom if you build structures 

okay 

equation is 

i think is that 

say 

if you're sexy they to mimi 

the nature 

okay 

problem 

we we can say that if we study 

why did 

uh 

one intrinsic physical product 

a study 

and 

sometimes 

people ask me 

y. u. s. begin to 

biological child 

or any biological world 

if you decide to individuals 

see 

this structure i mean by inspired 

can blossom 

commercial 

well now in physics 

a solid state 

trade 

the magician one hundred and fifty 

well as the bali

 

biologists where 

and by inspired my to do science 

stocks 

i can say you 

then 

a dinner duration poses when caught in sin and riptide 

can participate a nail even urbanism it's you know 

temperature 

forty two 

self 

life is over 

okay 

if you have 

forty for example 

but these materials 

simple it 

us 

to my two girls 

organic materials at which a company 

um biomolecules 

because and then mechanism also force and the physics of them 

probably 

probably will be different

 

but before the tuition 

they're also 

will show this say the same 

physical 

okay 

let us start um 

form on this thing was going on and i will show you my 

my client okay 

you can see here that we can 

such a number 

who decides what is the man 

she 

if you now than it was 

a few meters 

you can 

an exceptional physical picture 

exceptional because you none of his main 

that 

we can speak about long dimensional structure

 

wow 

angeles logic it's not a look 

it is what we hear 

hmmm 

one frame on 

we have a long plane to form and the bottom 

caplan said that um 

for any 

any physics for a materials 

if you have low dimensional of your nominee to size 

you want to comply 

when tom and as i squeezed together 

when wavelengths of well it's gone 

he's 

close to dimension of this particles 

exactly what we have 

now the struggle just 

several economic crystal and blacks 

connected to each other by non government 

balance but each of them 

well dimensions 

let 

national quantum confinement phenomenon 

well 

is it's too late 

oh indeed 

this this is development is 

of semiconductor physics 

and then i was appalling t. c. t.

 

seen it 

but in all shia 

because you are 

many of your form 

ceramics department 

and people do not read 

oh 

synergy defiant all kinds of very interesting 

oh 

i think and related phenomenon 

okay to a city really never talk to give economic now optics many of them 

you 

the problem 

in these materials 

okay and we will see 

eh 

they do exist 

okay now 

division in goals high 

okay modulation these are blind 

it's ten 

nuclear true 

but 

i need 

two 

to introduce you inside the field

 

okay 

why will speak about intrinsic properties 

and we all speak 

will speak about self assembly mechanism a new generation 

nobody knows store with my application 

i can say you guys switch 

who are close to finish their care 

i mean 

p. h. d. or something like this 

it's 

family meal 

an extremely 

each field 

it's only it's a starting point 

okay he grew it 

ah this coalition 

which i will try to answer 

i will 

once outside also later when we see 

experimental data showing that was going on in our minds five materials 

but in a way that 

issues 

also revised by 

right now i'm a staunch it 

stick to us what's going on 

site 

biology 

by inspired by old biological 

the same 

luckily collusion 

this recognition 

this same composition 

probably 

we study what's going on 

now about okay 

eh 

we could use 

could use this manner structures 

okay good day 

career 

they didn't do this 

i think 

and finally he told oh 

but 

bruce 

or lose 

doings 

which we can see there's building block 

hmmm 

to adopt 

five of subject 

oh 

okay no problem structure 

when 

each of 

this building blocks 

comes 

this 

to die 

more 

okay 

now you can sit picture which you 

have already seen 

okay and 

you know what 

i would like to play games in bed 

air 

diane 

you turn up 

yes of this 

depends on when

 

oh 

i mean oasis 

babel simplicity in design 

site 

he dies at all i mean it's just that is right 

in change and i'm at you 

okay in future 

angel manager in utero 

simply 

okay 

you can change 

oh 

mentions of your well dimensional structure 

you could change 

q. own 

you can tune the way for names of your quantum well 

late 

yeah 

it's it's amazing 

it's a great 

but 

but it might be development 

two little tics okay

 

i 

our winner 

eh 

physical 

the position as my colleague 

but i was 

me to do it 

it was absolutely occasional at all well if it's a compositional look as an olive n. c. 

and because of the lead plane in milan on 

after one controller so started to speak 

a default 

during the night 

i understood 

the launch 

i size and this was a it's it's a likely chance 

i 

and in one month with him 

build this and after this 

scale 

system 

very simple 

never hit w. has something to me 

and you can wait and waste 

that'd 

to doing it for for different 

you have tried same immune i. s. is 

and we 

i was very surprised from the very beginning 

sim 

oh and does walk 

and that's what ultimately 

okay 

we we can better menu structure 

was n. resolution okay 

and look at these it's amazing 

it's for you 

okay 

huh 

this section is she cubes 

okay 

okay 

but 

look at least i mean cross section 

defra 

we eat is 

you know let's 

to to lesotho 

and overall see with me

 

is this too much of a prize electricity 

and if you're inside the chain 

oh 

you can find it emits also spontaneous 

he's asian 

when i was a little does not 

athens it 

two point 

we have a toilet 

these 

is yours 

and a b. g.'s over 

okay 

hmmm 

probably not it's not so funny 

i 

guess if it's always the beginning

 

hmmm 

it's the biggest beginning q. khan 

you can do a lot 

i 

self assembling elemental building blocks so what can be done maybe done 

let's see 

okay fast what we're doing 

what i'm doing 

all kinds of what was many of them 

not only to have not only five s. 

yeah 

not only in 

michael's here's okay 

now you should read it if we will think about it 

but also with problem 

how to make 

i'm on two wheels 

way 

a connected to what about tennis 

and 

finally while also found 

how to make 

now chips in a number 

i then to improve them 

to him 

in vamp was any density and so on 

and i'm looking for by abuses ceramics 

uh 

hope for 

and called for 

cook iterations 

okay 

they optics 

let's start from optics 

okay 

and this is 

this is for everybody can always what is this quantum well 

cool 

rather than all i will explain very fast okay 

a little is done for all 

this simple things 

yeah 

there's an eleven nine 

the banking industry is 

and you can find also all together was maternal 

characterization 

you can see here be quite 

optical absorption 

uh 

nominees it's okay 

oops

 

nancy 

assembly yeah okay 

but it is optical signature 

because we care for any material 

optical signal 

major bases them on a map 

this is a one additional i mean in the mail volume will be released 

for instance so on and many of them you know this isn't that that is a bad way 

eh 

of them in the least 

s. pacific 

of to collapse of menezes according to the structure 

of the morning 

okay 

i will speak about 

silent indifference structure which are composed from from eleven at night 

this 

one with him 

and this is why on 

ros shown 

magazine 

a few years ago about 

five years ago okay 

the same given no 

what's happening take it took 

a lot 

time to an extent 

but it's amazing and used

 

a beat 

for um from optics okay 

look at this 

with 

five weeks without vapour deposited 

she 

place none of belts 

and this one 

very nice little kids 

hexagon a 

now was 

was this exec about was also also promises us a lot 

okay 

but 

what is interesting 

if you're looking at a picture 

you can say a dead 

instead of these 

take like you 

you have 

stay play 

oh 

stabilize to collapse ocean my secure them 

the 

from biochemistry 

came to me and that my boss 

told 

told me to call start was you 

cool 

and he begin with my students also 

and he asked me 

what was going going i can what what what what what 

optical absorption i don't understand 

what's going on 

i look at his graph 

i told him you finished your start it's 

yeah 

i used to and i'm for you 

for me i 

because i was so 

everybody who is in the 

in semiconductor physics 

doesn't all 

said at stake like optical looks option

 

it's exactly optical signature 

for quite a while structure 

what is it i will show 

oh 

okay and little did this one 

this one showed us 

yeah 

people like 

different absolutely 

this and even i mean 

okay in this case 

this 

and this is separated from liquid 

absolutely different optical spurt 

and i told him you know 

again you finished 

it 

as much freedom 

okay but anyway she finished 

several times but finally finished 

about two weeks ago 

and it took about three years but the class but she's very very very fast guy

 

okay 

so think about typical absorption 

while i was so interesting blue kids it's 

ought to collect social got station 

that is directly proportional 

every 

one been seduced states 

if you have about material okay 

a link to um expect a means of 

homage and used 

in any place to lead to chaos 

doesn't look in any clues that it's there 

second year students 

so let's take 

oh 

people know about it okay 

this notion of tossed 

but 

about materials 

and three motion of electrons 

in any direction 

that's going 

and when we do

 

little dimension 

no 

some or all few nanometers 

yeah 

really need 

you could limited aimed at a time when frank's of the button 

hugo 

french physics 

okay 

oh 

noble plus winner 

we say idea when he was only twenty four 

to give a 

she 

given to to do a little tones 

we've products 

and and in now we case if you 

if you 

dimensions 

which are close to the border with legs okay 

fiona animators those of on so 

you can speak about 

or 

one can find phenomena what is it 

but 

oh 

that's 

okay you will bring 

sample no okay i am absolutely here i can go 

you can almost three what is that doesn't mean we 

because my dimensions is much smaller than 

that's okay 

i have no that's okay 

and disease gaze i'm absolutely free about 

thirty steps okay 

oh 

well in negotiations

 

when you when you a dimensions or a little wavelengths 

is this close 

two 

and 

camelot in prison when you're looking 

okay 

for example 

if of course it is thinking 

now now here 

to his limitation 

in all three 

directions 

peaks 

big dimensions ease 

close by 

these very well 

okay 

why do action is close by 

these various 

and you know is football 

on some revision 

oh 

she is not as a quantum dot 

okay 

i 

because 

oh 

as it is 

next to a nice home 

they were 

in two weeks and why and leave a deep in debt 

okay 

having babies 

and he goes it came to listen to this 

but this is they teach 

for shame 

okay as for you 

excuse why also strongly 

indeed 

she can can move 

okay and what's going on

 

but 

instead of say spectrum of 

why's it um what jenny was 

was it continues 

okay 

we have stops 

to the lip service 

and foresight just watch a state like 

okay 

if you go to all 

to do this 

but 

as i spoke novel you are limited in a three dimensional 

like structure people 

no apology to look for years 

only about twenty is sick and tired 

as in microelectronics quantum well 

and quantum do 

structures

 

but it is true 

but you have loved you mentioned 

and you can find it 

amy 

if you have a spectrum 

oh 

ocean 

he's a signature 

that is why 

that is why we can say that 

very pro deposited the bag nam and europe's okay and stayed like optical absorption which you can see here are 

it's a tiny quantum 

five 

quantum of structure 

in all 

another 

set of it 

thirty layers 

one two well a user 

people should suspended 

system which cost at least 

twenty minutes of the 

almost unthinkable 

seven a thomas okay 

here 

in doses of second you can 

okay 

ten thousandths quantum wells 

that's all 

not what it meant 

okay this 

let your head 

like it means 

this 

a compost quantum dots 

oh 

okay 

and we should thus okay 

we should yeah 

we a december yeah 

so abominable of structure can best so this simple

 

with this 

family 

in two dots 

now the size of 

each one to number meetings 

if you'd assemble them 

founded the yeah 

this inspect 

the same identical 

and he explained 

x. ray also this eh 

okay i do not know structure 

london on a new designs 

with them 

chico probabilities 

and the same 

chris 

so this structure 

okay so we have 

or 

in these cases 

quantum dots 

would you can find 

and 

and you can speak about 

they do 

okay now 

if you're looking 

i 

that agenda 

think about quantum dots 

you can see that these

 

greg duration for early on 

oh 

it can disappear it cannot feel 

free 

as in the bulk restart that is why 

and it was a squeeze that and moving by many strong blow into action 

used 

women are strong 

that is why 

people like 

amanda well of quantum dots 

because 

yes 

pronounce luminescence 

the 

isn't that we have 

your v. and women isn't 

for the deposit 

manager you can see 

when they found that 

we can get voluminous sense 

it was a it was okay 

the 

a mountain 

let me remind you that we can change 

the dimensions of this 

two malls 

okay it means that we can 

change become a 

if we can do it for quantum dots 

and while looking around the clock

 

but 

then propose 

this place 

was unlimited 

number 

col us 

okay and all important 

it 

it's different sizes 

right now 

look 

which can be changed 

i 

in the 

case off a a this team 

we can 

i can show you a little about it 

in 

your region 

well the quantum wells 

presented as gifted us 

but do so far 

yeah 

luminescence of

 

it on the region 

at room temperature 

but we don't need 

i 

to hold in the material 

and 

i strongly 

well and electrons and holes 

that is why we can estimate estimate 

the dimensions remained since one 

two 

another meters okay 

so far 

if 

gobble dickens it is and you can see that 

this may deposit eat 

manager 

well you can for 

thank you 

and find 

from this 

data 

based you 

uh compose fault 

fleming days 

oh 

well there's layers of peptide 

reach 

on 

mamma crystallized and they put g. o.s

 

such a structure a key 

and 

but i can say 

we can and can 

speak about 

by late 

now you can which you and 

i told you yes 

okay 

and 

when i 

sure 

this 

i clicked reply 

i can say 

yeah definitely 

it's also that that 

not this one if in the log in 

like psychic 

we found it 

much of a cookie 

yeah 

yeah 

quite well as much 

self percent 

now 

oh indicates 

this 

hopes we can read quantum dot structure like this one 

okay 

and they found out 

in jobs and they published 

new person 

he was about semiconductor died 

you can assemble and this family 

and we can speak about 

this quantum dots violinist 

a quantum dots

 

biomarkers 

but we should 

global to the 

well 

visible wavelengths 

okay 

it takes time but 

i absolutely sure 

it's possible and we're working committees okay 

eight 

now 

self assembly hall was going on 

what is really is either do structure all day 

you can see as of vessels are 

of concentration 

variation 

saad shall we 

don't see anything 

but we see their survey small mama don't inside 

when we 

um 

tool 

hi 

concentration 

we can't in that we can't scientist auctioning microscope 

okay i just met one 

and 

absolutely different spectrum of one was 

quantum dots 

less than the sun valley 

the quantum walls

 

and these keys 

and 

let me show you very interesting fact 

if you are all 

measure be a situation if you find 

it takes it 

that was an 

is going to become a twenty five animators 

and the human genome is ends at this lumber 

and you 

okay 

right place at c. d. c. 

suddenly you see there 

so 

savage of composition when you don't have any network 

ever read a wide 

rare white spectral 

but when you come to widen confinement 

squeezing electrons and holes 

and 

exceed stations spectrum is now 

and because the market 

johnson 

to see 

what did his way and i don jail in years 

in your solution 

you can speak about 

about the creation of quantum confinement 

and very mel spectrum 

about 

three point seven millimetres 

and 

this is self assembly 

you can see when you measure these 

these 

expectations take doom 

you can see 

online 

in c. 

a tool 

the process of self assembling 

your 

a suspect on 

this was of time and you can see 

hmmm 

spectrum was very many 

and 

finally you can see the red 

during that about twenty second 

the network 

each time 

every 

q. second you can see that 

federation of situation 

inside 

the solution was greek on this poses 

fundamental horse 

self assembly 

okay 

now 

very shocking 

sadly about self assembly 

it is absolutely new data anomaly travails 

we can 

observe 

fourteen saloon 

a military 

rules which i um 

so so malware 

why would this is news 

we consider the definite stages 

so in signatures 

on off optical of saddam 

and being an expectation 

i don't like to go to 

too small a new tool

 

do do all these data mob because let 

but anyway 

and when we start from a wide spectrum of 

a frank's attention of 

amazing 

finally we come 

who 

few none of this 

and we see in my just god 

do we care 

i'm going to cost 

they're lucky charms 

to see 

how was greek one night 

because 

we 

can't stop disease poses 

it 

kenny at any moment 

but inter music incubators 

material 

most 

in solution which can stop

 

the direction of self 

so 

okay 

now 

ah 

critically city 

buster eighteen sixty 

nah there 

hmmm 

biological world 

is asymmetric 

and 

there are kinds of phenomenon 

okay 

like 

and actively knowledge of economics 

we channel eight 

asymmetry because it described 

our brains are okay 

possible 

up 

simple observation 

in bold biological and by inspired materials 

so we should find these phenomena okay 

it 

lenders grow and and see what's win corner in biology 

in charge of the contaminated phenomena where am i 

mom find many years before 

this was his lecture okay 

and it was that it was parliament because plankton bombs 

in fifty seven 

and after doing his second or more new generation 

they manic baltic affecting never progress 

but later 

in nineteen sixty six 

len found 

probably properties

 

polity city spend ten 

monday's editions 

you know what 

in bowls 

okay 

people started to cable it in following the men 

the building blocks peptide in dance 

definitely 

yeah 

i've become bipolar moment okay 

finer 

and 

probably to jolt but anyway 

okay when 

your zinc 

on on burroughs buys a big effect will follow 

i am a generous 

latecomer i'm unsure 

and kelly 

in many groves 

and these develop 

and then use of force microscopy lead roots 

absolutely in homage a nose 

and we have 

spongy those balloons vision 

in our 

brazil's reach 

oh 

later compose burrows 

well the functionality a 

there was a sense of this snowboarding also 

probably it's only a 

as a phenomenon okay 

but let us go 

now okay 

that governments brilliant scientists here 

russia to west law 

pay and iced 

strategies senator one hundred sixty did that died 

and we found that most of them 

i was we knew beforehand 

impostor okay behave 

studies go 

related to a single structure 

most of them 

indeed 

spontaneous polarisation 

and probably felipe city 

to change the direction 

nobody did it yet 

we hope for the best looking nile 

again don't even go structure leprosy but they can use definitely a 

very interesting but i'm you 

ten minutes okay 

a mexican a stalk 

yeah 

by julie pace at you 

has to be should be mas 

must be filed and here 

it's a question okay 

now 

when we 

started to study it in details were found 

it's a midi p. six one 

okay 

and when a mile 

no no 

oh 

a result 

onicha fusion 

oh 

you can see in 

when i was 

hexagon structures of greece of these non acute okay 

we graduated was home and he's great can be a fan

 

in the measure 

for many many were to ask 

and we found that when i'm at europe's 

yes the has 

do for says 

bad 

there 

stu won't be easy 

fission 

pre storm guy was 

holly supplies we should measure many many times i don't think that the disney streak 

because a hawkins is is very skillful 

in this case 

anyway one hundred 

become a dollar 

which

 

it is at the beginning of billions of dollars 

and billions materials 

four studies 

defence of the study some limited 

okay 

ah 

and what is interesting create a web zest also second i wanna generation for us 

and there's a point okay 

but in addition i would like to show we were there which okay the december was it week which old 

different people heroes 

but it is simple to be 

alarms to see 

there 

all these tubes have 

spectators polarisation what is it all 

this one 

what about others were 

okay 

and finally and when 

a scroll to grow my mom and 

i've heard it was 

humour found that 

finally gay city and it 

debt 

at one time 

and fifty cents 

disappear 

one 

i'm going on we will see okay 

eh 

where was visible from grace television so from a little structure 

found dead 

we didn't know about it beforehand 

when you 

we did we knew that did this for solutions suddenly

 

he 

sound linkage between them 

the link 

very odd ambrose for 

where 

but i 

chemical 

but 

different people died i will show you what is that 

different 

one hundred and fifty okay 

absolutely different purposes 

nice to give points 

a level 

oh 

to my knowledge okay 

let me show you a few experimental data 

they 

this transition 

open knowledge oops i've defaced on vision 

five five structure 

she okay 

i would like to remind 

there 

what's going on 

if you 

roger to another 

from 

took place 

prime dropped two plates 

during phase transition exist 

job 

let's see what's going on 

okay 

way 

found hence my students great guy 

look at 

individuals you 

right here 

candid 

but maybe 

in 

okay this is 

with 

it is 

anjali's close

 

oh 

really with these 

god's will glass late now we will 

do it by x. way during q. t. o. k. u. week 

you see that 

it's called the most 

and you have a glass light 

state 

a key 

i must quickly 

increased transition not of these conventional killed 

conventional like 

such a place 

farm 

grand 

goes to 

shape less okay 

the 

you cannot become better 

offs 

q. and as a family 

city could be but it it's not believing perfect 

it is not what we know confederate visited 

small displacement off 

hmmm 

titanium 

it all point one one on 

hmmm 

okay not not destructive conditions 

oh 

it's not the case 

q. s. 

oh 

which atomic displacement okay 

what about 

g. c. structure was going on with these 

okay 

let's go 

let's see what ability farm so good job

 

because of 

new models 

and 

journals 

inside the cube denounce time 

then it up 

but 

and 

um dried off topic 

extra money 

thanks to forward 

okay as you can see here for the structure 

no 

and 

color 

subsystem each of us 

volition of all for internal structure 

in the case of a story 

i'm just never found worked with him 

oh and it up 

found the term vision farm asymmetric 

tool symmetric 

so that is why 

the symmetric this image is one 

doesn't do outdoor jobs if anybody saw that take effect

 

so often job 

symmetry and close 

five rows 

their isometric and close five is symmetric open are 

well imagine 

probably 

but these are the big 

definitely 

i spent dennis polarisation yes 

and this one 

this is jobs 

symmetric structure that is white no 

oh you forever electric like effects 

but 

it is interesting that nonstop 

good sublimation 

saigon 

i'm not sure that everybody knows it is not the right time to explain what is it 

but 

anyway we came to who 

really interest 

singh invited simple 

conclusions look what's going on

 

hmmm 

it is 

cannot be in inorganic 

okay we have federation of 

holland box we can we can get but not unfounded 

physically 

yeah i like this one 

is close to one hundred and fifty 

this is 

huh 

and i mean group and 

yeah 

are connected 

ruiz singled not to 

and we have died 

thanks 

the 

okay different 

that is right shape is different 

but that is different 

and and 

and in a drink is pepsi 

and hopefully absolutely different 

okay 

he 

so which is transitioning construction of wouldn't want to address some of and provision then shortly 

um 

oh 

we can do a constructive faced 

position 

okay 

and applications 

there's a poem is five minutes okay

 

look at this 

we can go 

and we are going to number for two weeks these violations were 

speaking about 

michael michael reasons for computer interconnections 

and well looking around the world 

okay that is why we decide 

if 

to develop this method for eighteen 

of not uh pear by none of them 

this number two goals 

very very good 

okay i think you actually is and 

storage devices 

i didn't think about it 

but

 

this is our 

oh im easy 

we started walking 

means huge 

gucci israeli company 

oh 

a we so because you can follow 

that we can enlarge capacitors 

by one 

the times 

see now that's come to 

home 

they'll technology and to come from the future 

we stand with all kinds of 

not simple conclusions 

but anyway 

a key 

piece by in spite of media 

else 

made by good 

competition only 

community 

it's it's 

each 

believe me i'm surprised 

oh 

okay 

they're quoting so on 

interesting 

think of it 

system which can evaporate 

diets parties anyway 

tool for example in the case of the page 

the 

a transportation in a van 

only sixteen 

lots of dorset don't speak about 

about 

may distant part of for this of these business 

oh 

it's very interesting 

open 

a key 

nama biomarkers 

okay here i call the 

it will be closed 

but i'm not sure yet 

so all my team 

including dad now this is a form of oil 

this is this 

but everything which is related to menu suits extremely complicated and takes a

 

too much time 

form 

for for people there was not one guy but anyway most 

it 

okay so 

and this 

laziness it's all pink floyd optics 

and you can see it's also dissolves with 

the lead devices 

and pinky employed by lasers 

and 

it works 

and places in the future 

is that most okay 

i have one aim is to finish 

and these 

another to bring issued i would like to show you that we developed 

you're different manner 

europe's of these of fuel 

different bad guy 

as 

and you know what 

but as a tactic but that isn't so

 

or on 

but i would like to say you definitely is that well looking 

or 

almost all 

but i've seen films and 

by 

electric ceramics house including 

in the original 

thank you 

saw nanoscale resolution terms of users 

and true to switch 

each one will be individual operating 

and another one 

i told you that we can december 

we can use them again 

representative um 

biological world want anonymous does 

scale 

non adult israel and optical properties and probably was also

 

oh 

trillion miserly p. program is 

do 

we need 

i give good omen yard 

no we can 

to my surprise 

properties and 

but this one is a shame 

using a do a job articles of these 

as a building 

also the future number technology 

for example 

memory devices as an judgement 

advisers hobbies or electric devices 

as 

which is very small of analytic memory 

but is an ocean is 

at the latest 

one of those of magnitude less 

then today 

exist in 

michael electronics including 

plus member which is where we're a long i mean flesh limited this one 

okay 

eh 

a a real 

exactly 

a clean 

the 

planes 

quantum go environment 

a semantics margin phone 

big problem is 

and there's a said 

judgement 

very flexible 

eh 

it's probably it works 

well my students and my colleagues 

it 

the most a 

nice but for me 

binds through 

patience for my for my colleague 

one night at the time 

with unforgettable 

okay 

by the way i understood over the askew 

what is the engineering rather like 

old people i know housing the way 

i integrate completion of this but dives is that guy 

this 

at least he told me 

they haven't because they would like to create 

oh 

some things it could be a life 

mccain's glut 

but 

japanese announce stem cells which 

started to leave 

started 

so 

it's not the same but anyway
