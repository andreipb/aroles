yeah maybe you have a 

the patient 

uh see him much worse 

and down 

if you 

the whole thing here is that if we were dealt with it you any yet 

oh so intelligent mind active 

this time 

initially in its early years 

went to be a ninety or money lives 

and down 

and now they're working on the yeah 

were they do 

some of you 

india network 

people but it's very 

well 

but i work with those on 

defense network just social networks 

so i gave it to be patient 

worse still i still work 

this is one 

it works 

grass and billions 

um 

here in word 

but 

there are everywhere you have a lot of networks play 

internet or that your state park essentially is that these 

um the network 

but 

and this is done 

also if you don't work 

another area 

so here in a 

all you have now 

here you have a social in yellow 

here's one of which is he ready 

so um we use them 

um do not 

in the area 

we can extend 

oh 

our work too 

there's a lot worse networks 

unlike the way 

no 

he didn't know 

the 

good for him 

he he now 

oh no no this is the worst weather 

me 

the question that 

on the road and they yeah 

they're everywhere 

part of a working on 

i have these problems here 

my work 

but by every 

men also worth on the learning worker 

you learn 

um 

i um 

and the or 

rich media work 

you figure out where i've dies and it 

this is another company in the u. s. 

um that she you can 

an incident 

um 

there 

i work 

you are 

um 

and her 

oh what a network

 

there's not a key 

right 

the earth 

what were they didn't 

you want to buy people 

in a network that is a non 

so only on 

cast as if there was 

twitter followers who 

be 

these missions 

first this month 

they use that recent pictographs on them 

the knowledge representation 

our big issues are working on it 

this is a registered party 

smart meters it you know 

they're installing be them smarter 

stanley to um 

this means 

you're wrong 

you're not 

gas usage and so 

okay 

it's a network of support meters 

obviously search um 

the social networks 

so 

there are people in this city was due to this meeting

 

as opposed to 

in all walks in 

and together 

ah so 

well social networks are okay 

this often a bus 

the first part of the past 

this problem 

is it me discover 

we now have 

the 

questions that you are 

on the role of where of thing 

today 

so i think we have a single nominee 

we would choose between 

they are lazy or you want to um 

this is a thought oh 

a um 

so ah 

some of those 

but that's it 

model 

ladies for other ones 

other than just it is sparse labelling 

like that 

it's 

but you know so that you go 

oh 

using this structure and you know they don't know your sex your age nothing i can make some babies and just structure 

and 

um 

okay now the front 

so 

oh so it is to pass out to choose between algorithms 

want to it 

lady henceforth label 

so 

the um 

for quality english word 

or they were like this one 

legal 

he didn't like know the table 

well 

um see it 

the new york 

so you're you're you're the printer 

but here i just love 

all they do that 

the application 

oh 

are barred here you are lighted by a suspicious lot of different

 

what does that hurt each other you know some of them 

are some more you want to be it 

propagated figure out 

um rest of the state of what is 

a part of his role in it 

no harm 

these papers 

so in this area 

is that the u. c. l. 

oh boy 

mark up 

a your honour 

i like it 

so you can see um 

this may have hidden

 

holy 

but there were a baby 

it it lies 

so this is like a history 

um yeah 

that'll be 

but 

you can actually ends with guns you want 

in it 

this garden 

they 

of the um 

more than five acres um power 

other part of it 

to work on 

our first label for 

what are you 

you know 

the topic 

so we are 

right 

the bus 

do you have thought about it 

thanks 

hmmm 

to him 

so there is zero 

yeah

 

hmmm 

just like 

we don't do we have a young 

we don't have anything on 

so here we are with respect to a un 

what to do 

i'm sure you think that's 

even more 

this is the education network this is a physics 

there's a year 

but this is good for purchasing the book 

okay the least another one 

um bridges 

being 

not there 

down 

it is ready to india them or not 

it is in the eye 

we have had little books 

in the morning 

we 

you have a hearing her with a 

the ghostly log 

oh 

yeah 

is it used to this 

on the field since it grows and here but 

but he wrote 

it's like it's wesley this part of buyers 

busters surfaces we wish we were right 

so you see those hours bars 

oh 

he did 

on a g. r. e. r. 

i thought that the parent 

and 

basically what relational meters 

do you always 

you have light

 

we need a hallmark lady very poorly because there is the tendency 

well i do not do very well 

learning that can see 

but for the first grade we were 

yeah 

the contents 

so it is 

he said 

it will cost a lot so i will have that 

for this across the different data 

the 

what 

later 

it's 

he is very bad 

area nurse 

yes 

so what is the flyers 

where there is one worried only the tendency 

there is where you don't like it depends on learning of the day of the regular

 

um 

for this it's a 

i don't draw with 

you have not want it 

bomb 

how do you have been 

for security have you 

now this approach 

to take the way 

this is no i'm not 

patient 

oh 

we don't have it all 

so 

right if only he was there 

it's back to me 

this was very involved 

you know if i get the money comes back 

here's the 

not be their hero used to live there 

this approach 

approach 

it notes 

and a half 

people don't apply 

means that 

so the worst because 

they have no means 

so h. d. 

right so over 

so this was the topic 

yeah it bills 

lady bird goes what actually sir nineteen eighteen and invent

 

shehu 

oh it's actually 

we use 

it's the e. u. 

figure out 

what are my first person 

so many things right 

oh 

oh o. k. so this paper 

but without any 

sure 

oh you know 

i think this is a 

but we don't have this actually read just want to use the of the structure 

oh oh 

but what it is increasing number of the money was no great 

she is the first correlation between the buildings 

and so are closer to one another 

it is for us 

yeah 

we did it 

you walk me start 

so you can see things so that you see here this is a teacher 

big question mark 

he 

the number 

yeah to the other 

the path 

what 

do it 

a function of those three founders

 

oh 

you are any less 

um 

oh so they can be explained structural similarity 

we figured we start 

hmmm 

when we deal with wobbly idea 

oh 

so what we did 

oh 

the wobbly right all of the native each other and all other features that you have black and white 

black 

now 

so we can double luckily is me 

and what he said i was just the supermarket 

oh 

but with easter candy 

wishing without this number two here 

which one you're putting other don't believe for which is known high
-----

 

this is the last one what is the key 

are similar to do with equal to 

the c. e. 

well being 

he's working at the times that 

what have i am probably the initial their initial factor 

zero seven one on the five elements 

we 

we just what are these are not the one thing for me this 

this 

so of computing 

similar 

sorry to john wayne hunter the next one 

so when you 

a home network 

we need to work with 

you stumble office right 

here are similar 

to her 

so let me 

because there's no 

the the competing so what i am too 

similar to me 

the network 

what we want it 

similar to me 

the next person 

so it's like 

we start this negative 

yeah we separate from 

but 

a different level now 

so 

oh eight 

does that make up rotation of me 

i 

um hum 

so it's easy so the answer 

you know 

other stars all all i have to do 

this simply you the population 

they are my 

okay

 

so 

i mean 

the more research 

because it is 

the only power outages 

do a 

way to go 

i did 

in 

he just 

so 

one of those that is not a 

or the audience 

they are doing 

they're getting 

oh 

but that seems ish 

so what we did it 

we all those but we 

so i want to six percent 

um 

relationship type one 

there is a relationship to relationship type regions of work 

i think it is 

but 

the answer it here 

the first one 

t. b. c. also you care for people know each other 

one can be uh 

relationship type two 

that would be called each other relationship type we would be 

on that a town home 

the s. m. s. or something 

yeah 

the english 

um 

you know what the edges 

and then when we 

we just bought a outages the forest

 

ah but the buyers 

features 

the computer 

each so they won't be a number of errors 

that lead to her hair 

that our were from there 

they were a 

mediators there are that have links from my god 

okay so this thing for my neck 

so 

if you do 

oh 

he will have a fourteen features because 

her wish you luck to you 

here are some experimental without any questions 

there is the first one that we want somebody that are not so that no other people and they are 

yeah and that he there are there 

he was the only have labels were thousand um 

yeah for over thirty five thousand 

it is not about 

so quite hard to 

a windows are effective 

he said this the physics papers say that it is you don't 

okay 

papers every official geometry 

it was 

forty two 

papers fifty thousand 

oh 

for example the one place for this one percent of this l. 

on one percent of the key 

that is true 

so let me michelle being conservative going on 

my task

 

or here 

the people we wanted to know somebody who is you know 

so there is an thirty one five 

the younger people in this study 

for me 

um 

so again on that 

so 

a lot in these networks 

it will be learning 

so how 

it's the simplest one 

yeah 

the earth 

great 

she ought to know that have been 

this month 

it was a no relation 

which is just a probation has or

 

these people 

this is mark humans didn't think in beaver 

connection between civil war 

the light 

to have a boy 

part c. and not believe her 

so is that between the no 

this table 

okay what you expected duration 

let's see if it is to build up a report 

but what you expect 

in reading iteration 

all of this 

talk about this show you 

the seat numbers for the data showed 

so this is the bomb 

oh 

it was to know that you up 

the close up there are on 

or what is the number of those that are black 

you have a 

here 

yeah 

posted to 

they are black 

yeah 

no one in your life 

one was minutes 

our way 

working on your 

a graph 

so far in there seems to be 

she is too well how to link each other 

what 

a number of things 

but you have no no no 

what you expect what you expect 

four 

our of one to nose 

all nodes is this piece of the buttons 

i just do it initially 

there is very similar except 

oh sorry you were able to do it 

over what you expect which is what i do

 

in one 

which is one that didn't grow up 

you know my nose times p. again 

oh oh 

he compute this idiot here this is why a lot 

this is what you get 

well 

executive is very high so it has very high vermont 

expect that you know 

expect it to talk 

she 

so 

he liked it but trader 

which is not 

i have a twenty 

i have a boy

 

right where you are 

hers furniture maker 

as expected 

i hope of 

pause 

because the new job 

you know 

so extensive 

the trouble 

but people like this 

you are what are the city 

other people 

oh 

they eat them 

holmes smart rooms that instrument 

so this is a full time 

those down monthly 

in each other in the lower 

in the aluminium 

the latest on this city 

so this is a server that they had a show you some stuff

 

we hear there are secret because we have the 

we we haven't 

our new label is 

all right 

oh yeah they're actually do 

oh we do is 

we have ever listened 

who was here 

we have 

we are doing here 

yeah 

that one 

this easier to know the hardest part about by 

and then shot over twenty 

yeah 

all of this 

there 

hmmm 

and different individual us 

the first one is 

relational neighbour wishes 

i just see 

you know what the majority of them 

it 

but they are 

plus relaxation going to be 

the bus station approach 

oh 

where you know 

but there is a blast their neighbors didn't really get it 

right actually out some of his shell 

yeah 

but the art of us are are are 

or are identical 

up to the city 

oh sure that you are purchasing power 

we're learning with that 

versus very silly little ones 

they sound all those that this is a a 

the lives of the 

but his and stuff 

this is an example 

these four 

well that the patient 

on that

 

wait just one but 

what about 

they way 

so this again 

with propagation 

number is our 

first it was it was learning 

here are 

he 

or other approaches 

you have all star city 

okay 

yeah you're going down this of course in a 

a number of it you have 

does this point 

yeah 

ah 

past performance was over 

i'm twenty trials of the agency 

which is the right one 

and since 

and for this one this 

where he only 

or just assume you want 

way that no one 

oh great 

we're still going on 

i have a touch 

yeah 

oh 

we are here 

we are

 

or is it there 

if if you 

there is a real sport 

this way 

the table 

the key here 

he'll be here 

had this case we have here the others 

able to tell 

that is little squares with these are urgent 

currently 

so 

this was never work in other words 

oh 

but this is a hard time 

yeah but i don't ask any kind of way
-----
 

i was attacked by having so actually tell 

boring label 

one that they want their behaviors 

for a case where a bit bigger 

but there and more 

which is just 

her 

okay 

my name's neighbour 

this is very simple is that he shouldn't worry 

she city where you can learn don't hate and learn 

by the edge tell him 

but how much we can monitor our city 

a third 

this does 

it's called it a shot 

which is seven different areas 

yeah yeah 

these are see her

 

nice to bring our performances of all the experiments that we did all forty eight i 

even the other ones 

on that so if you don't have that they didn't want to our methods 

this would this not to take away 

of course 

but there are two things that 

population approaches 

we have a pretty i've seen it right 

the other papers 

eight eight eight 

get it to me so gamers are about 

a touch the ball 

now that's a valuation

 

uh 

these networks in a sport but don't get it all 

any questions 

that condition 

it's like a right 

oh 

that had a lot of the hallway 

i also 

sparse they're all 

i just walked in telford 

they should be things 

it's not a crime 

so 

it works 

but he is very hard for this country 

a spot 

you probably probably not but this scale

 

it can be order in square were a number of nodes for you 

you want to be a paramedic so you 

use it initially tell you that you're a kid 

pretty straight you want it 

there 

the right number of groups 

to be consistent to work on social networks that works but it works 

um what the survey courses that you want to work their grades up their lives 

for the fact that we 

it doesn't supervisor her so you have more of an additional we are 

what was that 

it can work 

they get 

it too 

it was only back 

right so the social network 

just elites 

communities from it does to me it should be your apartment 

so what migration 

he units there 

which is a small variations in our community is to be a lot 

if you want some of the edges 

the media shouldn't go away from you think 

okay so here are affect the lives of 

we didn't work

 

our property that we want our means sorry about that 

the ability 

not 

consistent 

all the different 

the effect of the village 

we decline 

be believable 

or what 

yes yes 

its membership 

where are you you can tell you the truth 

i think about the fact that of media 

a public works churches 

yeah the incident so if the community that no part in to me that he didn't 

the probability of 

to t. v. 

to be actively this probability 

oh so 

two years 

yeah 

the group

 

what the probability of us or to the computer programmer out here it's one of these things 

he here or something 

but here we are seeing it 

because it here 

ah ah 

elsewhere 

on more than that of course 

this was more units 

where he is it all it was a small deviations into this is a variation of information 

don't worry me 

two 

thank goodness and by three 

oh 

so 

back 

even in the park clustering itself not so much work done 

this is a 

he's a good idea 

i didn't expect the lens 

is higher than a 

these going out of it in your life are there

 

the 

i compassion for us 

and this is work here this is this is her 

okay 

you matrix 

you will swap they're all these blocks 

out of date 

oh 

the meeting is finishing up here 

we can do this with each other 

but 

the only thing 

right so it's sort of person with a with that part a grass or here we have movies or 

if you were the users to each other 

that would be stepping goods 

right 

my first 

uh maybe 

hmmm 

you may be your source is quite you 

or related part if we continue 

in this approach the distinguished at you 

the workplace 

our lives that you are 

a book 

this game in 

so this 

but i think 

over this one 

there 

therefore they're all the time 

so we 

so it's not my personal life 

oh two 

the interstate allocation simple form of it 

we work on us 

so this is everything 

we're seeing groups are is this your relationships 

this past year was seriously want

 

the probability of 

sure sure 

given ships this stuff 

buses ships 

you might see it but 

but that must be 

and then east is closer to see 

but you're not you know what 

no it's source 

source notes 

into this in there are always community and in those communities regulate 

what happened to me 

so 

eat 

as the 

and 

um so this is just so back 

oh 

here 

they 

the persians are turning to maximise lake here

 

the chip 

the white explosives 

it 

it has a great shouldn't 

um 

the association 

this is michelle a tracer stopping the rose colored get something like that 

it turned to be able to do important part of a 

a description of a 

yeah 

this thing 

there's an allegation 

the b. a. 

um you know 

l. l. d. a. you have these text document this 

the words in the analysis on bag of words and stuff 

what is the um 

badly partitioned into these documents 

here's a simple 

each another gets its own document 

the late 

but in which it points to 

it's words so here 

no one 

what we know why 

links to go to the course of two or more 

no no to her 

not going thing 

now here 

it isn't enough to meet you 

one source 

it's hard to know here

 

if you are 

for dark at four 

but this is a simple heuristic for 

our stuff 

to this format right 

and then apply this year 

no one 

so it's 

well who 

not be consistent with respect to think so 

on this is a question 

this is a very short 

this is the light of our systems 

this information network 

communication network here yet vision 

she 

do well and growing and others is that 

he 

you shouldn't
-----
 

they insist on top 

here's a good movie 

my part 

this approach 

but we can work it's a framework 

two parts or 

you hit 

that hit us 

they lobbied the gamers are these are posturing happen why i'm 

the ancient past my leg 

and hey takers 

the approach is 

on the south 

a star 

foster right 

and why this 

or is it as a as an infection or dive into it 

ah 

and it's all here is one 

whatever 

very good at it can do very well if you look at all groups 

this can feelings hidden or this is not new 

but if you want to 

the same 

okay 

uh what you want to others 

and we have been 

so they should work 

and 

this picture of 

they had 

they said they were on 

he's a big i 

we are 

different cases you need to 

twenty years so colored by 

membership 

for free you don't 

and 

oh 

um 

out that maybe steps 

the white space 

your urgent action is very very high here's the cars are 

yeah 

are you were here 

and a war or white space that really gets higher 

this is 

he believed that grasses much as a solution

 

on this 

these two approaches 

c. area 

yeah 

they are higher than that 

hmmm 

so 

it is 

oh who hits red tape in these kids 

so he has no part part but you can't see are you reading your own 

not easy these are certainly some graphic 

in respect to there are times 

he can take these 

right 

oh yeah 

continue 

along with me has a right in my inference 

there we found it was useful is actually take this means 

so 

you know what do you want 

but they are 

association 

groups that you wanted to 

they used to use it into the lives they you any worker 

but um it did not have to be seen that much 

and this is beyond the model for it 

this is this the other 

there's a television and the extension 

way back to us 

so we have a different way reply to target those those are the gerbils 

yeah there are words which are that if we want my fire on the character the observations that he's done 

we have 

we all we do not know from groups it's hard 

the other groups 

then you will hear from source source and student groups 

or maybe i don't want her 

this is another thing 

of course who to you 

purported to model so 

my hands are also those of you 

yeah i have 

what i see there are others 

when a parent my my actions 

this is the word that is a you know your your hard over the first 

attributes 

this leads to 

yeah roseanne gives them 

so the question 

okay i should experiment from grass o.

 

this is just you know the number of years or this one was a white background 

we have networks are diagram we have one gram 

um information on 

network that the ground 

oh 

never components so a lot of work that lies ahead 

a partner in the u. s. 

you you have all these 

different that's right 

so this a lightning components 

oh 

and 

these are some of the brain 

characteristics of 

of it 

so this 

so i can only one

 

the party 

the out of here oh 

for that little is being two point eight six and that's the highest bigger me networks 

we expect that politician newport 

so there are different networks 

is it even harder to take it out 

her political parties increases 

oh so some of them 

as 

then do that 

the number 

oh 

so i didn't want to figure out 

oh i have to do 

be this simple search know you want to know where it has to be 

so what do what it means that if i 

the 

these two almost no other parent 

so the other group for the source not thinking who 

what the probability are 

that argument 

this article from there 

now on 

this will be also 

what 

a sensation backward 

we don't density 

so anyhow you 

the number of the group that he wants to the ones who over the all possible number 

if you had a taste you all summer 

great 

i would you do you need 

and 

um 

okay what these are

 

the you know 

he's going to ask 

we do this over and over again 

sure 

this over five different 

so 

progress in the various our grass 

but eighteen who are now is that really see 

they are they are the biggest 

being 

and there are are are 

our proposed purchase 

um 

working 

you're not much much for the community is a this one we really have a lot of 

a lot of the bay 

they are they 

why is that is association 

for the high 

um why 

i don't care 

on the roads 

b. g. 

so 

ah 

ah 

bankers are are harder 

this year receiver 

the different networks

 

this is a morally i get the networks 

very well on the on her 

work 

you see here 

par 

oh she uses to it 

right you use it 

kids' heroes 

well 

if you get information for it 

different 

um there you have cell 

the suspect that they shouldn't 

to me 

and i haven't used it 

and in what 

hi there 

there there should be 

it might

which changes from zero to one 

or is it a graph is more 

you you may be right 

about the information 

and here are a a 

why 

oh for me for the original music for the past the reverse 

oh

this one 

for whom 

the wrong sex is clear 

here is what we have the right now 

here it's you 

on the other approach so i guess fostering here's a string of hours doing so well 

he came to flexibility 

right so 

for begin 

let me explain all putting it all right 

this isn't nearly where you want 

and they shouldn't 

um 

he doesn't play out of a classroom 

this is to use the spring of workers 

turns out they 

in here and it didn't turn 

it's not 

you might say 

superhighway 

oh sure you follow what i like that

 

was it for me 

but above like my situation 

they both sets of hints 

two 

i shared my audience what happens 

oh well 

the others 

these groups 

this forms were right or he is from different people you might be yeah 

so i can do whatever 

and who are 

angry about my mother all 

oh 

maybe it didn't work for each doing more work but they do 

given permission 

it didn't do very well well worth the trouble 

this one 

diversified on grass

 

yeah 

okay let's see if it were a number 

why 

the 

now but there are there 

here 

and um

he was that this is we were we 

the people who 

the long form to look at the other 

you can do good deeds 

it would be more 

a 

and then you simply 

oh 

the movie 

okay 

so 

a 

if you look at the objective function 

were gone 

the e. p. a. 

you lead to addiction 

but the community 

being 

source 

these are used in those communities are being 

which start this source

so when you right now he is scalable only looks buildings that part of the air 

it is that there is 

the topic models 

you were given right to live in a little more than a document 

we do this 

only only love their nose to have links to 

a lot of things
