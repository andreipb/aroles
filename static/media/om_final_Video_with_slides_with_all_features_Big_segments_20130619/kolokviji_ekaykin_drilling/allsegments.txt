i'm very pleased to seats to see such a huge crowds on this very special day 

um in this lecture hall 

and there's a special because we have an extraordinary 

a very special visitor 

doctor alexi hiking 

who's with the arctic and antarctic research institute in saint petersburg 

ah in russia 

i'm introduce the speaker 

um shortly 

so 

he finished a 

b. s. studies and ninety six 

pat say us in petersburg on state university and he's tethered geography and geo ecology 

now um 

and then he did his of p. c. thesis in two thousand and three 

but it was a combined study had a saint peter's remit university and a 

you palm universities according income mobile in france 

and then he was a um 

postdoctoral fellow supported by the japan society for the promotion of science 

from two thousand and six until two thousand and eight 

um 

he was stationed in ho chi them and

 

and since two thousand than eighty 

he's a again with the arctic research on no arctic and antarctic research institute 

um 

he has lectured a head d. um said petersburg state university 

and um 

the most important part of his work is that he has been 

to be um 

antarctica many times 

he's been he's participated in eight expeditions to antarctica he spent a total of um 

eighteen or twenty months 

and antarctica 

and ah 

now he's here to tell us something about his stay antarctica

 

and i should mention that he's staying uganda his visit to ghana 

is a part of the bilateral collaboration between on russia 

and string yeah 

so 

oh 

no 

everybody 

now i think you for coming 

and such a huge number and thank you for inviting me to do 

to give this talk here 

it's a great honor for me 

it's only friend in little bit nervous men you win this and you can

 

and the yeah 

and person to think one of four in which me and 

yeah it's 

was he who are going to these bilateral cooperation 

slowing in russia 

well it's someone 

a without talk 

so it's 

this a bit strange title means that i am going to tell you something about antarctica both you do it in a wise and well 

submission leaks 

and well 

you know sometimes when you're a 

you know talk to you think about 

a phrase 

it bigger which describe 

the best 

the idea of your 

what you are going to say so you know maybe these 

should you know lisa phrase fortune favours the brave itself old legion expression but 

let's not about us 

we cover 

of our us 

our russians are some of his expression 

i'm joke 

of course but so you know that's the role of good luck is a very 

that's very beginning in 

of the story and 

i will give you several 

examples of these 

we can make victims of these fucked in our life you know 

you maybe you could see these a picture some menus so you know that's 

the beginning of february two thousand and two elf 

the give driller penetrated to submission nicholas token 

i i know it was a good discussion will be seen in in mass media 

i was still in antarctica there so i did not 

i could not dissipates and i could not 

see these news

 

but so well this is what i'm going to tell you about the british history of these sort of this event and the 

way we hydrogen at all stick station and way we are exploring these early coastal 

and so on and then again 

now i'm going to start to use these 

this um ever want a chicken and a 

a russia has no five ah ah 

printer and stations ah 

demonstrations syntactic of this just one is nearly 

or garrison no other skin because girls and

 

and there or 

two more in soviet times here it was a risk a station killing us care so 

use simply conceive a idea so we wanted to make of these patients all around 

the perimeter untidy continents just to 

a have 

a kind of control maybe some biscuits for you that's a 

this study is a non tactic is 

maybe not about sciences about politics you'd 

people just want to to be to be there too 

keep an attempt to somehow 

and then also station 

right here 

close to the center of the continent 

so why 

most okay is located where it is located 

and now we fortune again 

plates a played its role you know that in 

nineteen fifty 

fifteen is a 

in fact a continent was mainly unexplored 

and people decided well you have to do something with that and they have a nice to international 

your physical you're right i do i 

one of the main goals was to a study 

to study a a antarctica 

and people get its some way to it was a new york i think and 

i decided where to 

which country you open 

their stations 

and of course a soviet union wanted to open the station and the softball you know because

 

we already kept of 

moralistic all are to cover you you had a 

the east gift in 

stations 

at the north pole 

and then re wanted to also do 

the whole the self and you know 

keep all over the planet 

but russian delegates he came too late for this meeting 

he just wasn't regional 

it happens with us 

and 

these self almost already taken by americans 

so i have a underscored stationed over there 

and these sapporo sort of gay she called his was his encampment ask what to do then

 

okay let's take a soldier magnetic pole than 

they have a chance of him and 

this is 

more lists away almost took station he's 

and then it was again as a child or cino logistics does transport 

caroline from you need to these 

in mental antarctica 

it started in ninety if you to seek cent 

well it took to yours for them to go 

to go there because 

they will more as the host who traveled it 

in the interior on tactic in in such a

 

harsh conditions and they used the technique like these have no 

some of these machines are still alive by the way you may not believe me 

but once a bit dissipated in that are are susan 

maybe exactly these one machine and um 

still alive somehow 

and well 

so they were moving moving and find innovative eight 

said the kid 

we can morning wallets 

okay 

just just hear it to be almost sixty 

hmmm 

and ah 

actually if 

they moved to just five kilometers more 

they would 

yeah they would have gone 

offshore drilling core stock 

and they stopped 

just the right place 

five kilometre more and there is no link 

under the station 

so it said just good luck and people didn't know about the lakes at all the time 

just no idea about these submission exceeding in antarctica 

well what is was took station 

so description with so it's a 

altitudes three thousand five hundred meters 

and that that's why it's so cold and so low pressure 

very difficult conditions for can and so on 

and still v. call display some norse or six two keeps a record to though it's not the highest station and then 

and the precipitation rate is very low like 

and sahara visit more or less and 

well there are 

menu rocks 

which are performed there's a 

it's a lot of scientific to to like literally of course money to sphere

 

groundless logical observations did do by scoring into a early cause took studies 

a nineteen seventy years and 

very important 

milestone in most accused in the first degree and then begin 

not not so not to regenerate gets you know they still didn't come under lake ten 

so i could do many stories about day these guys the well but 

no time for some questions 

that was 

i hope somebody will read 

real or read this book 

so sometime in the future 

so way people drilling nice in nineteen um tactic actually and enrichment and another 

other polar and munching glaciers 

well it's also a long time ago that people would realise that's the glaciers a really 

redwoods climate archives 

because for example at all stoke even in summer temperatures minus thirty so as there is no melting at all

 

and all the precipitation are kept so there and accumulated four thousand two hundred years 

and if you did 

pete for example 

ah you mean yeah 

recoveries for silk precipitation 

as we can say 

and if you study of the properties of these layers 

like chemical content and whatever you you may study what was climates 

or whether 

during the formation of these precipitation in the remote past 

ah okay bye shoulder can make if it's maybe ten meters also much more if you want to go deeper and 

ah 

more following time than you need to a place some techniques like drilling for example 

well the principle is simple you just have a a 

cylinder of middle to prevent knives on the 

on the bottom and it's rotated and catch in ice and then you get these ah 

cylinder of ice which is called i score 

and then you'll 

making huge 

piles of these ice course and just called cost origins it's like a a 

no frozen climate archive 

plummeted okay 

and then you a 

well started to property so these size 

these big all ice here is actually a air bubbles 

and so they up as of today in days since the the 

many many years ago so we just 

have samples of ancient atmosphere you can study the 

just content over for example 

then we can study the as the p. continental of ice and he gives us the temperature and 

because study purity's and came in 

go content and size of far 

ice crystals and whatever 

and after all it appears that ice cores a

 

maybe the best monochromatic archive comparing to all other sources of information like 

makes it emits in marine sediments entering send whatever soul 

ice cores profusely 

ah 

well the biggest quantity of data and maybe review 

better quality pictures 

and this is a very 

short or you what's was 

ah produced from or stock i score 

so we have a 

full climate history overview 

broken roughly half million europe 

from this i score 

we have one two three four full climatic sign you

 

psycho cycle so now we live in a warm period holocene 

and it was a a 

called periods for two thousand years ago and the 

ah 

previous inter glacial previous one q. team in a hundred and 

during two thousand years ago and so on and so on 

and ah 

also very important to the city for the first time from most of my score 

we received to the

 

a record of our 

greenhouse gases 

enough of the atmosphere of a planet 

and now we know 

for sure that the amount of guess is that which we have now in the streets unprecedented 

it was looks like these so for me to know yours before you know 

it's not natural 

and for the first time it was shown that there is a way takes correlation between temperature and greenhouse gases in atmosphere 

and so on so that their what they have been picture many discoveries made in 

based on this i score 

and in nineteen ninety nine french go she'll just another repeat you publish these 

famous paper

 

it which was 

she's then cited 

many thousand times it one of the most cited a pain 

geographical science and by the way 

so i just want to tell that was talk was quite famous name even before this 

lake story in all it was 

these stories of a long and and 

ah 

is it going to so many successes in 

in this life 

and then in nineteen ninety eight a something happened with ice with a score in its properties a changed 

dressed chicken is so as to pick sign disappeared 

and a gust contents these drops to zero and so and so on so the purpose of this size was

 

totally different 

and the reason was found a a very curricula soul 

people just l. a. that's we ended to the 

lake ice so the ice which formed from the lake water 

from the lake be nice to be a 

use a mobile whole because they call stalk we have to various 

melting in the not impart and freezing in 

self a bottle of the league 

and this is how i'm seen a 

slowly secretion into the 

my main subjects about legal stuff 

and first questions like these can know what exist on the jury frozen antarctic glacier

 

fifty thousand years ago of discretion sounds a bit strange of course no because that is a minus sixty 

on on the top of the list says so how 

can be melts on the bottom but 

well i'm sorry simple there is a 

your formal flux because our earth is a warm 

inside so when you go deeper to the ground 

temperature increases and the same job the same is going on in blisters 

and if you 

if you're ugly she's sick enough 

then at some certain dips it will melt 

simply melted doing which are not important

 

one of those guys who do you describe these theoretical in a it was a good surgical 

he was a very interesting person but he was right and maintain sold 

he was a really good into the stories by the way he was exceptionally good 

and he published the speech in nineteen sixty one and his showed the area so milton in a under antarctica continent continent 

so he was like 

one of the first schools they ridicule you a 

proved that these lakes my must exist

 

the lawn tactic and it was another funny story related to him in nineteen sixty eight he was defending his thesis 

a bolt all this 

you know melton in in antarctica 

and the well v. professors did the belief to him 

they said no it's impossible 

and then 

she again he was a very 

lucky because just 

one day or two days before his presentation his difference 

something happens in antarctica at america but station vehicle 

did real went to the bottom of the of the glacier 

so open to international january nineteen sixty eight 

and the water came to the bowl 

though a 

rather sudden didn't show in what a layer beneath english but what a came 

animal to forty meters to the warhol into tools

 

totally unexpected for them and they even lost made real 

it was a kind of got us often and so on 

and they sent a telegram to to these great gives at ecofin she showed these 

on his defence 

and it was a success 

so he became a doctor of science or something 

okay and the 

i will tell you a few more milestones of this ah 

story works over discovered lacrosse talk 

next important 

person to to be mentioned isn't because it's a she was eat

 

nineteen fifties he was younger guy and he participated in second antarctic expedition and he meets basic sound in sin on the interior 

and he received some 

you know the double reflections from the bottom 

and she interpreted it is a as the sediment sedimentary layer 

but actually it was what l. a. as we know now 

but he misinterpreted it 

and and remembered of all these the results

 

fifty years after that 

and in ninety six he published a paper in nature and bo didn't discovery of 

they cost soaked that so she's considered as the person who actually discovered 

more listening these and the well in nineteen is a there or 

a rather serving a profound the buyer 

a british people 

so they 

use their airplane reason or other and they 

a obtains 

reflections typical for what you know and 

hmmm 

also in the area of of a where they cost of these but

 

also they did not realise there is no one single huge lakes a huge lake they sorted so 

like water lenses 

a screen at all all all around 

and sussex 

and finally in nineteen ninety three so 

after these development of satellites air out and still edit imagery 

a people constructed size maple for innovation for the caller tactic and then they saw 

these very strange 

huge or fled area so 

actually that tactic surface look like these it's a you know it's a trip to lake a 

of the sea floor for example 

very similar to that but in some places they could observe very for terrorists very unusual it

 

not to to become the it 

they realize that in these places the ice just floating on water these weights or flip 

and this is the this year or is actually the 

you're when 

everybody said yes there are huge lakes 

under nice me antarctica 

ice sheets 

and this guy really she actually gave the name to was to click 

just because there is a or successional there 

so simple 

well 

just some pictures a holistic look like it one of the biggest and on on earth 

so five a just taken the wall to fuel a consider the water war room at six i wasn't 

cubic kilometers

 

very huge 

v. areas like fifteen thousand square kilometer it's very simple tool ecological for example the 

the biggest european they can all 

north west of russia 

a way deep like a like 

twelve hundred meters 

as the deepest from him 

so the only one by the way there are many many lakes so a small lakes of their shown by triangles he rents 

even nasa bushel the reverse 

these people believe that it does exist and the 

it's not very popular subject to study because ah 

people are realise that's a these 

hydrological system many of antarctica is very important for our eyes dynamics were reasonably futile taken it into account 

then you may think that's a or 

ice sheet is much more stable than than eat eat eat these issues 

so i mean that it is one stable enrich 

and we must take into account when the ah 

focused few the future a 

this integration the white sheets for example 

stuff like this 

and ah 

yeah this is how he's 

a seven usually remain look like this is a real picture of a once a bushel tunnel 

somewhere on the age of over antarctica close to and also to scare station 

and if you remove ice sheet maybe of the year 

a bedrock will look like these this is a area of directories 

those two curves i'm a commitment the station

 

and the people beliefs 

it was a huge water flows some union million years ago here 

and so if you remove a ice maybe have a rest of antarctica look more or less 

this way 

so eloquently while a close talk isn't most interesting for us 

first of all the d. biggest 

but it's not the only reason you know in a 

a really think that it is 

quite it's a alt 

lake it's who could exist four million euros

 

a already and it could be separated from the rest of the planet forty million of yours and then 

unusual forms of life could develop their for example that's that's possible why not 

and er so it is considered as it on a local for a of a local for extraterrestrial 

sub glacial oceans which exist for example of the euro complainant it's a satellite of jupiter 

then it is located so very well in terms of logistics because yeah we have station that 

because station 

and became allergic logistic the transport every your the way c. o. 

that it along this route so remakes paul the lake is that you know

 

more or less easily 

and after all we have a a 

you can do it in 

project here ritual started much before because 

ah discovered 

but now we it is also used 

has access hole to the lake right 

and we have a a 

one and two hundred meters of acreage at lake ice so we can study league before entering it's so real indian or

 

a lot about its before in nutrition to the lake 

well i just want to say that sometimes and the driven is not very easy as you can 

think for example there are many of their main accident happened during this he'd written history 

and it's good time to 

a tele basic it'll be strange name so it's a bebo whole now is called wage do 

the name of double hole at the door stuck 

white five g. two g. it means a global key is deep 

in russia okay

 

a fight if it's of the number of these bore hole 

it's warhol number five d. bore hole number five 

the previous four were lost during excellence soul 

the drills a war or student and 

you know taken by iris basic reason essence old 

and 

even for these serve 

a few bore hole there is a 

a full of the english name for this 

ah well 

it's it already second deviation of the main 

on the main blowhole in all because for example in two thousand seven 

again did real war was lost a disease that 

and scooby study study it started to new bore hole but look from the top 

from the dip so flake three thousand six hundred meters 

so 

there is a technique which allows you to make a new warhol not from the do but he is possible to make a

 

deviation from the from the mean wholesome home 

well what would a nobel delay color eighteen 

what do you do you know before penetration 

well not that many things way the ways so we know the morphology of the lake of course the size of a limb and so on 

we know that there is a melting of ice in the nielsen part of the lake and freeze noise 

ah in being a cellphone part of the lake

 

and what happened then 

all the impure to send us assume each goes to the lake and not impart 

okay he earlier just arrived from from ice 

a man in the leg because form and i see it's completely pure 

because slowly frozen ice 

no it pushes away all the computers and guests 

and they accumulate in the lake 

and this is why there is a 

we support there is a very high concentration of

 

gases and of oxygen in the lake 

there is a hydrothermal look to to the hot springs the tools that you make 

somehow we we can no 

we can know about this 

well that is not perfect nixon only smell to what the women goes to the freeze in a prison area 

and this is why maybe there are some ecological niches for the micro biota to be hide it from these 

hi oxygen levels because oxygen is a poison form 

before microbes 

and there is a target for the environment and the lake there is nothing to be to the picture and to expect is microorganisms which can you there is that oxygen unique

 

so they like must like oxygen 

and it does not normal now than steel 

it's just a fantasy of of microbiologist 

and came out a troughs uranus and with me and so they feed themselves but without life use in some chemical reactions and 

okay and snow 

few courts abode they lost the season the tools to reach started to 

well driven started second of gender into the 

and of the season or was fifth of february two thousand twelve 

yeah sorry i just make some you know

 

reminder for myself that i can now run you to to 

to show you some pictures 

it was an unusual season i should telling maybe the best in my 

of my life in my palm experienced was the best one 

and the miracles began already invigorated india was days of the season 

grabs october 

and you know 

i was not alone 

called so today i was not drunk 

so i have a yeah

 

five or 

six people can go crazy in or the same time so we have to work 

and then after all i asked actually people who study the guards 

they say yes but it's possible that they may play into the interior of article four 

unknown reason they should be maybe just you know 

like spies or something like these they want or 

they have a 

uh searching for new 

ah the places where they can feed themselves and so on so late replay any direction and of course they dive in and 

it's a very distorted but 

but i took with pictures of 

after all 

but there is a mission of the pitch is unknown 

not not enough which 

but it was a clear sign that something must happen this season 

this is a row of mine a bore hole five g. a 

this is this is called look like in the mid nineteen because he's a polar day of course and distance 

you understand why we need to use this ah 

in aldrin must because ah 

it's it's like a home for the drill 

when we go we know put up 

so we took a bite all this place in in these symbols we may 

and then you know dismantle it and and so on 

an easy way to do 

this is a well one of the organ moment 

and before the dream and because we can just go then stud reno 

we need to study for the conditions in the book called because it's it's seen in all the major inches diameter

 

and so on because though you 

we use a driven fluids to put to the bore hole 

if you don't do it then it will be squeezed very fast 

and drew to a close in in maybe a few weeks or months you know 

so we use early grits 

ah v. of a density close to this a joyous in which can be freeze to the temperature when the sixties so it's image of kerosene and three only 

and so before during re check of the density of these fluid and if it's too 

a lights and we put small prey on and so on so

 

and it takes up from two weeks one months this preparation a walk before driven 

this is one of the working homeless people take samples of these fluids to measure density than 

well as a in the last days of december two houses two thousand eleven adrian began butts 

restaurants 

they were empty know there are no 

on or high score for some reasons we couldn't break it and pull it up 

and few be professor west into ferment really he look 

quite disappointed you know you 

look into the dealer a ending game and 

and this is why our own your body was quiet 

sads 

even despite some nice drinks over there 

so yeah

 

people were disappointed but not all there 

oh 

some people just didn't care at all 

and 

okay of a fine a second of january the trust i score he sees quite long because it was real children 

several rounds 

and so you'd really like three times and 

finally you get it's so this wait so long 

it was obtained during 

but his career and as far as i remember it 

you can see that for example diameter here indicates different 

so this also maybe one run and this was another on and so on 

this is a meaningless eulogist 

she still adjust them to think of 

he is the chief of all this a project of exploring the coastal kind 

and gives reinforced 

okay 

then a closer to the end of the season a 

it was two or three meters to the lake as we know now 

of the ice core begin 

look 

a very strange 

you may be can see this 

very strange features there you know these are like 

it was hot water 

going down a 

a longer via their score so this is the top or scorn this is a bottom so we water was 

you know flowing down in treason 

you can see this card trick 

very characteristic feature and here again 

and this whole 

i score must look like usually it's completely you know 

it's beautiful it's very small

 

ah 

only small 

particles all four of these 

ice chips 

which forms during during but otherwise it's a 

complete his move you know 

it'll quit here but it's not what it's kerosene 

which which is a bridge and slowly 

and about the last day i score looked like me so we felt that what is very close 

but a close 

then if you so favourite lost our so or 

season the new header 

yeah if you used are still was took station this is a minister of natural resources so for 

russia so our big boss you know 

and this is a of the head of russian had a mental disorders 

also i'll be boast but 

low level 

so they came just to to check what is going on they actually because snow nobody's know what do 

of them wore was in um under conducted before the just wondering 

what's going on 

and then re gave some marino mendelson the 

two 

to some people and 

which is the most importantly 

gave us some nice drinks like all score yet for example 

this was much more middle 

watch much but that is for me 

well and so at that time real magic and no real world region you that's like must be very close because in that in the beginning of the season we calculated a graph like these therefore probability of penetration to the lake 

as a function of dips in all 

and if you've so for february be probability was already more than sixty percent

 

so it could happen you really every hour every minute 

and ah 

ah 

so these guys very early alert would be used 

they shouldn't even in on few so february 

and it's a we're all going you know too close originally and to prepare full even but we just decided to make it one more run just another and 

because we had some time during the night you spare time nothing to do of course 

yeah it's boring to sleep 

and the 

well and then it happened so it's a noon 

the time was twenty three 

two into on local time that was took 

and so during trillion 

the ah 

characteristic of of the parameters of june became suddenly very very strange stonewalled me 

pressure 

on the 

and real 

it increased to represent extremely hard to do 

two huge extent you you 

kind of get such a pressure on on the do if you just put it on the ice for example conjuring driven 

pressure on the drill it's no it can be like these you know it's 

model is close to zero 

and a a 

or or legend it dropped because it look like it's nothing to do anymore you know 

and it took so he took a load realist 

just two seconds to realise what's going on in to start 

pulling up the the do 

they're really good you know

 

no one of them had experience in that region to lakes 

how do they know this but the 

it took them two seconds there 

they're good 

gazing 

they really good 

well and two hours so after that severe 

i don't sorry five seconds after that's 

this is what was going on enviable whole soul the kerosene went 

from the ball hold 

because of the pressure 

lake water in or from bees 

so what was way too much and so the oppressed show these he could full of fluid was 

two three or four two spheres 

marceau lesson and pressure water in the 

in the lake 

and this is why it at the moment of penetration 

seoul kerosene didn't go to the lake no 

instead of this water rents to the ball home 

and pushed israel and so on and 

these are 

you could fluid up 

and the 

level was so high that it even you know went 

of the whole

 

into the hole drilling shelter 

we try to pump it's an drip onto like to barrels but that would be most mostly to dwell on the floor like one cubic meter manual 

maybe more beautiful which just their office commission 

and it's a 

plus it's like five minutes these 

these fontaine was functioning like 

yeah home in this marvellous 

then a the flute 

when down again 

and in two hours later we pull out of the drill and it'll clegg these it was all 

a you know 

a it was like a snowball 

so it was a frozen the water all around so 

it say 

a really good sign that it was a washed in in the court 

totally 

so to play guineas we never not known no one of us 

i have seen these before 

in addition to

 

and so there was some ice particles 

we should or 

fall down from from the drill soul 

people have to use it as a kind of protection 

and then this is how read real ahead to look like so 

the these 

a huge 

ah 

p. so why schools frozen own on the bottom of the deal 

and immediately we took some samples of course for microbiology was atop some song baked and send them to some people who still

 

somewhere in the sheep nine in antarctica do arrive 

on mates old don't ask me both click 

what we found we didn't found the youth anything 

still it still coming via via these samples 

and so they want to 

a third is er dismantled real the it it it was not possible 

it was not possible to luton usually so people had to warm it 

to remove this ice 

on those then you could the you know

 

ah 

briggs didn't do a part 

and the 

here this is wholly to head look like 

after we now 

remove to these 

ice piece 

and to extend the last ice core also we 

needed to warm the 

this 

these two 

and this is the last 

reading over the last one day last ice call pledged to warhol is a 

going out from from the drill 

this is called nucleic a 

a close a so you see that serve the top 

and the bottom on a 

ah 

do you guys call kept a life but the only me those crest tilted individual said to said typical a picture when you for example if you drop by score

 

it will be 

crests in the middle 

i don't know why but you this 

some holding mechanics walks like like be sold 

this picture 

also demonstrate to the to it was a huge 

it was here initiated by a lake water 

and the moment of inspiration 

well this is the you lost a 

ice course ritual put into the ice core storage 

and also it's a coincidence 

we just 

a we had just the same amount of these 

you know chips for a for the ice course 

as ice course themselves themselves 

so it was exactly the same number 

it will 

one of the mysteries of this season and by the way 

a after they've these you

 

now lost to run the june run the movie slow book 

of does it also 

was the last page 

so 

right 

and those who was like this 

so all around this season 

it was very strange 

and you know we have this special wall in the universe shelter when you're right down the 

a most important events and i think 

that will be of a lost the signature on this wall soul 

was that a 

i understand yeah 

this was it 

yeah and the data that's all 

okay and the maybe they have 

wouldn't

 

what about term 

they have a couple more slides slides if you're lonely to them 

okay so this is what 

yeah this is what happened during that 

penetration 

so the whole 

went to the lake 

and a quarter 

and went up 

now it's freezing 

the trees that are already i think 

and then next year we'll go there 

and do again and then 

this is how we will study the lake water wheel studied in frozen state we'll all go to the lake

 

at least next season 

but after after warts after 

maybe two or three or smoothie wants to continue the story 

and his slide showing you that is some the only one lake which you will be studied in in the next year or so that is a project that lake all sorts for example 

next year they will be into this lake but 

to be very fast and had really is a 

ah ha to what you know

 

they felt i score 

and it will take them just maybe tweaks 

three foster and it just consumes a lot of energy 

quite simple lower to do with me 

but if you want to get high score then 

you should not use of these service way and also it will be 

is i think an set of of what a sample of they will get a can of soup or bacterial something like these 

because it will be 

we don't have 

these microbes song 

i don't know what they want to to to study 

them and the 

next age of four exporter lake was talk we call the second penetration to happening i dunno in harmony your smut you want to put some probes into the lake

 

to measure 

some proper distance to to make it to to take samples 

and that it's legal sort of a real users something like these dubious um 

robots flying around and collects in collecting samples 

well and then i think of it so 

and 

and just to curb minutes more 

from you have than than expected 

think of much 

okay 

i 

oh 

oh 

yeah 

yeah 

okay 

who 

who are 

talk 

i'm sure you have gone 

many questions 

that is the audience has many questions 

very nice caps from was stuck 

but they think 

i hate snow 

what is the tip and delay 

between some 

i think 

c. o. two innocent 

c. h. applaud them beach and so on 

because and this that you don't see anything piracy only 

it's condom condom manners but it's not

 

now the delay seven interesting 

think of this question here 

yes indeed the render you look recall 

look at the whole graph like greece when we 

have all these four hundred thousand euros 

it appears like a it's all simultaneous temperature and the 

and greenhouse gases you know change 

yeah 

this one 

right 

ah 

but actually there is a it's not simultaneous exactly 

but the problem is of read it in over the ice in orlando a 

there is a quite a big error 

like three seventy years 

even now 

therefore such a timescale it's not it's not such a big error but still exist 

and the second problem is that the age of gas in the ice is not equal to the age of the ice of the surrounding ice 

because of course 

a little soap or so they are close to certain that 

like hundred meters 

and below the surface 

and v. h. o. b. i. said is this is like two thousand years the cake 

and the age of four the gas

 

zero 

so there is a shift to a number of h. bit in gas and the ice and this is a second problem 

but still we believe that's a okay first 

temperature studies are rising 

then a but a a greenhouse gases 

follow this ah 

a rising 

and then they cause the further than of temperature so it's a complicated process 

just temperature starts to increase 

then during house guests 

and then greenhouse gases cause of the year for the increase often 

the mechanism as we believe in something 

ah 

no 

how do we are the time like 

now it's just a it's it's like one two thousand years 

another off one two soldiers the delay between under house arrest and temperature 

and maybe ocean play a role in in these 

time like 

probably 

oh 

oh 

and 

a sea level 

okay so ah 

well i should think is data is i made it extracts from the ice core itself because ah you only it

 

you know maybe you may precisely measure the pressure of gas and ace 

and depression depends on altitude so you just may obtain the altitude two way street and then you miracle collated into the womb 

somehow 

and yeah and the sea level is just there from my own sentiments of course it's so wary of own on the cuffs reform a stick go from marina 

my instruments 

and they it so it's two independent cups monday correspond to each other when we have a

 

increasing level we have a list 

wally more questions 

this is my mom wasn't expected 

oh 

and it was for us 

okay 

well as a soldier in long periods of dust to the amount of dust is quite low 

like now it's a real to the lower montel dustin atmosphere but in 

i say juicy tools like 

twenty fifty times 

mourning period the more dust particles in atmosphere 

because a that was the climate or more like visit on on the planet and the area of visits or 

a bigger than now and the also iced the area of landless me to know them because the ocean was low

 

and also the transportation from ultra picks to paul are various war stronger because of stronger a mirrored in guardian and disclose the increase of dust you're an ice age 

the 

may i ask 

if you made some of those his own 

i built a resume of present in that you have tempers or water is 

and maybe be a consulting 

you are talking remote lake water 

not 

noise i said no analysis so armor that we don't have such a in or a 

techniques it at the station so yeah bring in samples now to oliver to do some some peas book i if i made this just testing 

should i tried this what 

but 

smells too much like kerosene toys 

oh 

one cannot recognize if it's salty also if it's fresh 

more more i think it's fresh but 

oh 

each of the walker like what that's close to four 

um 

a time to show the what a a a deal on bond between the glacier lake it's a it's melting point of course it's minus three degrees

 

it's not zero minus three right 

and if you go to the bottom of the lake and my mom is maybe increasing because 

if there is there a hot spring so there then it must to increase hall 

maybe to plus forty sixty of them 

you don't know exactly what these yeah 

oh 

they have more questions 

what happened 

thrilling chef 

between seasons 

ah 

ah well it's a 

a somehow consort 

and ah but now there are two people there to drill as they 

no not that they will not doing a finger in the book hold maybe some you know do do physical measurements they loved adrian

 

but they are they're winter in there just to keep an eye on these all these all this stuff and so on 

so 

just to use 

the 

all these years yeah 

that 

oh 

there's another question 

about the lakes 

because i was slower thing giving land 

was it has the best invented temperature 

well but in london said another story of course because it's much smaller than antarctica and the

 

a untouched to create really at a fixed to the climate on the whole planet and this agreement you know it's made the other mechanisms because small into maybe influenced by other other 

a parameters no comedy parameters 

somewhere else 

well actually i cannot on secretion 

properly i don't know the good the good answer 

uh no 

this is the picture we're looking at 

but the most spectacular 

one of the the drilling in the stock 

do you expect that it will be possible from d. 

water inside the lake 

to get 

so in 

so important results as these are here 

use 

have explained a lot of things 

these graphs here 

as it got so followed by oklahoma g. 

is there a chance this is 

borrowers guesses 

is there is there a chance that also in the lakes 

there are such big stores it s. scores you

 

okay 

well i think no 

actually we probably me if we will study v. lake sediments in future then there will be also comedy coast but 

it's just a dreams no it's a 

ah i think that's a bit of a kid a itself it doesn't feel very changes the changes on the surface of the year 

of the glacier because 

even that these are huge climates grace 

no they it's kind of go as deep as to the lake

 

it's me if you'll be thickness of the ice above for example 

but it does not perfectly clear much so i think 

and all this talk of a spider climate my text or reading a laker will not give us you'll data 

it it's another story of course 

huh 

more questions 

which you 

are very or 

no 

which sets with methods 

yes you know 

perfection yeah so they're making a good 

like big bang and then they listen to vehicle 

and so a measure the time delay of the vehicle 

hmmm 

and 

there was 

the on your 

sketch of of drilling codes 

when they'd be gated 

there was also some some layer of what you said sediment or something

 

so it seems that that the certain death 

the the 

drilling culled encountered some some young layer it 

merely prudence it's yeah 

human this one yes 

what was that 

uh that's interesting a story or it's a 

well in a lake lake ice is a divided 

in two big parts cool a case one just 

like these we call it the lakers won its with mineral inclusion sand lake ice to without conclusions completely pure 

and we believe that thick ice one hour it's on the upper part of the lake ice because it was formed a in the year

 

close to the coast of the lake 

when where glacier was correction the you know the console 

and i guess to completely pure it was fun so over the deep part of the lake 

closer to what stickers station 

and there is a one mile area which is extremely rich in mineral intrusions and you'll if 

i don't know the picture of me but if you look at it so you just see this live 

many many 

articles and some of them are quite big like once into meeting them to

 

he once here 

a soul and to reuse of these so there you know to 

i just to to tool ice course i do want reggie to this is why we started this deviation from 

equates in or quit above 

because we have this layout of minerals in the five g. one and twenty two so he may adjust the depth and 

oh 

what kind of analysis are you planning to do with geological samples 

oh 

ah 

well all kind of possible things ah i guess because i do 

another new person and of course we just send these samples to or colleagues 

from some pages will occur institute of nuclear physics 

there is a 

to give what's the name of this microbiologist and she uses d. n. a. analysis um how to

 

but 

described the microbiological continent also the collaborates resisted of microbiology most core values classical methods they observe in a 

recent microscopes and they try to cultivate and hopes well for the lake ice survey just has discovered that it's completely pure 

there is a less than one cell growth 

one millimeter of ice it's just not zero 

and up to now they could find only one a micro that's me believe 

was exist in in the lake 

what to say 

a kind of hydrothermal but year 

what really been in hot springs this is what it's one of them in a way we think that there are hot springs that well don't know well the only reason
